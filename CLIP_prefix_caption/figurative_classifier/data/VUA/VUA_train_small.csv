a98-fragment03,52,L_Ragazzi of L_distinction : .
a98-fragment03,53,"IN L_December , 1943 , the L_men L_working M_feverishly to L_create the L_first L_American L_atomic L_bomb L_sent a M_team of ‘ M_spooks ’ to L_Naples ."
a98-fragment03,54,"One of their L_main L_assignments was to L_contact L_Edoardo L_Amaldi , a L_physicist L_thought to be in L_hiding near L_Rome ."
a98-fragment03,55,"Six L_months L_later , the L_day before L_Rome 's L_liberation by the L_Allies , L_Amaldi was L_found ."
a98-fragment03,56,"He was L_interviewed by L_Moe L_Berg , then one of the most L_famous L_baseball L_players in L_America ."
a98-fragment03,57,"L_Berg was L_also an L_agent of the L_Office of L_Strategic L_Services , which was L_later to M_give M_birth to the L_CIA ."
a98-fragment03,58,His L_job was to L_convince L_Amaldi to M_pack his M_bags because there was a L_ship M_waiting at L_Naples to M_take him to the L_United L_States .
a98-fragment03,59,"L_Amaldi 's L_presence there had been L_sought by two other L_Italian L_colleagues , L_also L_physicists ."
a98-fragment03,60,"His L_mentor , L_Enrico L_Fermi , L_later to be L_called ‘ the M_father of the L_bomb ’ , and L_Emilio L_Segre ( who L_died in L_California L_earlier this L_year ) ."
a98-fragment03,61,"L_Amaldi M_dodged the L_American L_invitation , L_perhaps because ( with L_Rome L_liberated ) L_Fermi 's M_mantle in L_physics had M_fallen on his M_young M_shoulders and there were M_younger L_minds to M_teach ."
a98-fragment03,62,He M_wore that M_mantle L_well at L_Rome L_University until his L_retirement in 1978 .
a98-fragment03,63,But L_Amaldi L_never L_really M_retired nor L_grew L_old .
a98-fragment03,64,"He M_kept M_regular L_hours in the L_university 's L_physics L_building , L_spoke at L_scientific L_meetings this L_year in L_Moscow and L_Washington ."
a98-fragment03,65,As L_President of the L_Accademia L_Nazionale dei L_Lincei he had M_delivered the L_welcoming L_address on L_Tuesday to a L_symposium of L_scientists .
a98-fragment03,66,He then L_ordered a L_car to M_call for him the M_next L_morning for a L_similar L_occasion and was M_felled by a M_stroke while L_waiting for the L_lift .
a98-fragment03,67,"L_Amaldi L_grew up in a L_small L_town in L_Lombardy , and M_took his L_doctorate in L_physics from L_Rome at the L_remarkably L_early L_age of 21 ."
a98-fragment03,68,"In 1929 , he L_became one of the ragazzi di L_Via L_Panisperna — the L_street where L_Fermi 's ‘ L_kids ’ L_carried out their own L_experiments under the M_master in their own L_under-financed L_lab ."
a98-fragment03,69,"L_Emilio L_Segre was one L_kid , and L_Bruno L_Pontecorvo , L_later to L_defect from L_Britain to the L_Soviet L_Union , another ."
a98-fragment03,70,"It is L_interesting to M_note that the ‘ M_pope ’ — as the L_kids L_called Fermi — ‘ because he 's L_always L_right ’ , was only seven L_years L_older than L_Amaldi ."
a98-fragment03,71,"L_Amaldi M_astounded his M_group in L_October 1934 with his L_discovery that by L_slowing down , L_rather than L_accelerating , L_neutrons , he could M_provoke L_intense L_nuclear L_reactions ."
a98-fragment03,72,He M_held a L_chair in L_physics from 1937 until his L_retirement L_publishing more than 150 L_papers on L_atomic and L_nuclear L_physics .
a98-fragment03,73,"He was M_awarded L_honorary L_degrees by L_Algiers , L_Glasgow and L_Oxford ."
a98-fragment03,74,"He L_became a L_founder , and L_active L_executive , of the L_European L_Centre for L_Nuclear L_Research in L_Geneva ."
a98-fragment03,75,I had the L_pleasure of two M_long L_talks L_last L_year with L_Professor L_Amaldi about his L_knowledge of what the L_German L_physicists were doing with their L_atoms during the L_war L_years .
a98-fragment03,76,"M_Apart for his L_incongruously L_white L_hair , L_Amaldi L_seemed to have the L_mental L_lucidity and L_expected L_energy of a L_man half his L_age ."
a98-fragment03,77,"His L_modesty , L_considering his L_world-wide L_fame in his M_field , was L_endearing ."
a98-fragment03,78,I L_knew L_almost L_nothing about L_physics but we M_shared some L_jokes about the L_Rome L_telephone L_system .
a98-fragment03,79,"In 1949 , L_Amaldi L_wrote to the L_Italian L_prime L_minister M_asking for L_permission to L_produce and L_sell L_sealing L_wax for L_letters , ‘ so that we may M_raise L_needed L_funds for our L_physics L_lab ’ ."
a98-fragment03,80,The L_reply M_came from an L_under-secretary who M_said that the M_present L_funding was L_considered L_adequate and the L_commercial L_undertaking would be L_ill-advised .
a98-fragment03,81,"It was L_signed by L_Giulio L_Andreotti , the M_present L_prime L_minister ."
a98-fragment03,82,"L_George L_Armstrong L_Edoardo L_Amaldi , L_born L_Carpaneto L_Piacentino L_September 5 , 1908 ; L_died L_Rome , L_December 5 , 1989 ."
a9j-fragment01,1,Midwife at the M_birth of a L_state .
a9j-fragment01,2,THE L_INTIFADA is a L_people 's M_unarmed M_revolution against L_occupation .
a9j-fragment01,3,"Its two L_main L_slogans , L_repeated L_countless L_times in the L_directives M_issued by the M_underground L_leadership , are M_freedom and L_independence ."
a9j-fragment01,4,It has M_employed a L_dual M_strategy to L_achieve these two M_objectives .
a9j-fragment01,5,"L_First , a L_comprehensive L_civil L_disobedience M_campaign was L_begun by which L_people M_severed , or M_minimised , all the M_contact M_points by which they were M_bound to the L_Israeli L_occupation L_authority ."
a9j-fragment01,6,"This M_campaign L_included L_resignations of L_Palestinian L_officials from L_public L_posts , the L_boycott of L_Israeli L_goods and L_products , and the L_refusal to L_pay L_taxes and L_fines ."
a9j-fragment01,7,"L_Partial and M_full M_strikes , L_demonstrations , L_sit-ins , L_conventions … all these have in L_fact only L_constituted the outer M_layer of an M_inner M_mechanism of L_civilian L_rebellion ."
a9j-fragment01,8,"The L_second , and L_complementary , M_part of the L_Intifada L_strategy M_concentrated on the M_construction of an L_indigenous L_national L_authority ."
a9j-fragment01,9,"As L_Israel 's L_authority was being M_lifted , the L_population L_began L_creating an L_alternative L_authority of their own ."
a9j-fragment01,10,"L_Popular L_committees were L_established in L_villages , L_refugee L_camps , L_suburbs , L_streets , in L_fact in every L_community ."
a9j-fragment01,11,"Some M_headway was M_made in M_expanding L_self-sufficiency , whether through L_utilising more L_land for L_agriculture , L_developing M_home L_economies , or M_encouraging L_local L_manufacturers and L_products ."
a9j-fragment01,12,"L_Villages and L_refugee L_camps were L_thus being L_developed into ‘ M_liberated ’ or ‘ L_independent ’ L_areas , if not L_militarily , then at L_least L_psychologically , L_politically and L_infrastructurally ."
a9j-fragment01,13,"L_Bloody M_clashes would L_occur whenever L_armoured L_units L_raided these L_villages , L_storming through L_makeshift L_defensive L_road L_blocks and M_responding to L_rocks being L_thrown with M_live L_bullets and L_tear L_gas ; but no L_sooner would these L_army L_units be M_gone than L_authority would L_revert to the L_village L_residents ."
a9j-fragment01,14,"L_Palestinian L_flags would be L_raised on L_minarets and L_church L_spires , L_road L_blocks would again be L_erected , and L_life in all its M_aspects would once again be M_run by the L_local L_leadership ."
a9j-fragment01,15,"The M_structure of the L_developing L_national L_authority has been both M_diffuse L_enough to L_prevent it from being M_destroyed by any one L_single M_sweep of L_arrests ( there have been more than 50,000 L_arrests since the L_Intifada 's L_outbreak ) , and L_coherent L_enough to M_allow for the L_existence of a L_unified M_resistance L_strategy ."
a9j-fragment01,16,"While the L_entire M_network of L_popular L_committees , L_local L_institutions and the L_general L_public L_constitute the M_field M_commanders in the M_battle of L_civilian L_disobedience and of M_constructing a L_political L_infrastructure , a M_rotating L_Unified L_National L_Command M_acts in the M_role of L_field-general , L_issuing a L_bi-monthly L_directive M_outlining L_policy and L_determining L_specific M_resistance L_programmes ."
a9j-fragment01,17,"A M_high M_level of M_mobility in the M_structure M_allows for M_continuous M_interchange of M_roles and L_ideas , and M_retains for the L_Unified L_National L_Command the M_closeness to M_grass M_roots that is L_required to M_make it L_truly M_reflect L_people 's L_wishes and L_sentiments ."
a9j-fragment01,18,"THIS M_expanded M_network of L_popular L_committees and L_institutions M_making up the L_Unified L_leadership is M_infused by L_tens of L_thousands of L_activists who M_belong to , or M_identify with , the L_different L_factions of the L_PLO ."
a9j-fragment01,19,"In L_effect , L_therefore , the L_PLO M_exists at all M_levels of L_organisation within the L_occupied L_territories ."
a9j-fragment01,20,L_Thus the L_Palestinian L_national M_movement both L_inside and outside the L_occupied L_territories is an M_organic L_whole .
a9j-fragment01,21,The M_pattern of the L_Intifada has been L_cyclical .
a9j-fragment01,22,"M_Thrusts of M_resistance ( L_mass L_demonstrations , L_resignations , L_tax L_rebellions , L_etc ) would M_come in M_crests ."
a9j-fragment01,23,"The M_pattern is L_determined by a M_wide L_variety of L_factors , L_including what the L_Israeli L_army does ."
a9j-fragment01,24,"But the M_relation is L_complex , not M_uni-directional ."
a9j-fragment01,25,"M_Harsh M_measures — M_putting an L_entire L_community under an L_absolute L_curfew for a M_continuous L_lengthy L_period of L_time , L_demolishing L_homes , L_uprooting L_olive or L_citrus L_trees , L_physical L_intimidation and L_terror L_tactics M_employed by L_raiding L_army L_units , L_shooting , L_killing , M_cutting off L_water or L_electricity L_supplies and L_telephone M_links to L_villages or L_towns , L_mass L_arrests , L_intimidatory L_interrogation L_techniques — can L_either L_create a L_temporary L_lull or M_activate an M_eruption ."
a9j-fragment01,26,The L_army L_never M_knows which it will be .
a9j-fragment01,27,It is as if it is M_walking through a M_minefield .
a9j-fragment01,28,"The M_wave-like M_pattern of the L_Intifada , its M_pains and M_sufferings , are all L_reminiscent of the M_process of M_birth ."
a9j-fragment01,29,"The L_metaphor is L_apt , as L_Palestinians M_regard themselves as L_engaging in a L_process of M_giving M_birth to their L_independent L_Palestinian L_state ."
a9j-fragment01,30,"Through their M_revolution , the M_masses are both M_mother and M_midwife to the M_birth of this L_state ."
a9j-fragment01,31,The L_Intifada is the M_midwife of M_freedom .
a9j-fragment01,32,"Through it , L_Palestinians are M_struggling on a L_daily L_basis to M_shake off L_Israel 's L_authority and to M_construct their own ."
a9j-fragment01,33,"The M_struggle M_reflects a M_revolution in L_mass M_consciousness , by which L_people have M_come to L_realise that L_ideas and L_aspirations must be L_embodied in L_manifest L_acts if L_reality is to be M_changed ."
a9j-fragment01,34,"L_Thus , wherever one M_looks , one M_finds L_people L_engaged in the M_construction of the M_blocks that will M_make up the L_Palestinian L_state ."
a9j-fragment01,35,It is a M_conscious L_effort .
a9j-fragment01,36,The M_masses are being L_engaged in the M_craft of M_state-masonry .
a9j-fragment01,37,"In this L_process of L_state M_building , L_many M_stages have been M_covered ."
a9j-fragment01,38,The L_Declaration of L_Independence M_issued by the L_Palestine L_National L_Council ( L_PNC ) on L_November 15 L_last L_year L_constitutes a L_major M_landmark along this M_road .
a9j-fragment01,39,"Its L_significance M_lies in its M_double M_message : that the M_aim of the L_Palestinian M_struggle is the L_establishment of L_Palestinian L_independence , and that this L_independence is M_regarded as being not at L_Israel 's M_expense ."
a9j-fragment01,40,"This has been a L_constant L_theme of L_Intifada L_policy : that we L_wish to M_build ( L_Palestine ) , not to M_destroy ( L_Israel ) ; that we L_wish to L_achieve M_freedom ( for our L_people ) , not to L_deprive L_others ( L_Israelis ) of it ; that we L_wish to L_protect and L_save L_lives ( ours ) , not to L_endanger the L_lives of L_others ( L_Israelis ) ."
a9j-fragment01,41,"In one of L_several L_Intifada L_leaflets L_written in L_Hebrew and M_addressed to the L_Israeli L_soldiers on L_duty in the L_occupied L_territories , the M_message was L_repeated : L_Soldier , L_go L_home ."
a9j-fragment01,42,L_Return to your L_family and L_children .
a9j-fragment01,43,Be with them in L_peace so that we may L_remain with our L_family and L_children in L_peace .
a9j-fragment01,44,"We do not L_wish to M_harm you , or your L_state ."
a9j-fragment01,45,"We L_wish to be M_unharmed , in our own L_state ."
a9j-fragment01,46,How can the L_process of L_state M_building be L_developed ?
a9j-fragment01,47,"If the L_PNC L_Declaration of L_Independence L_constituted a L_major M_landmark in this L_process , the L_time has M_come to M_embark on another L_major M_step , that of M_declaring the M_setting up of a L_state or L_government M_structure ."
a9j-fragment01,48,AN L_ESCALATION of the L_Intifada in this M_direction would M_serve two L_purposes at once .
a9j-fragment01,49,"L_First , it would M_consolidate the M_structures of the M_developing L_national L_authority which is M_competing to M_replace the L_occupation L_authority ."
a9j-fragment01,50,"L_Second , it would M_consolidate the M_image and M_essence of the L_Intifada as a L_constructive , not a L_destructive , M_force ."
a9j-fragment01,51,"L_Naturally , to M_embark on such a M_step is not L_necessarily to L_succeed M_immediately in L_realising it ."
a9j-fragment01,52,"L_Rather , it is a M_challenge ."
a9j-fragment01,53,"It will be a further M_challenge to L_Israel 's L_occupation , M_conceived in the M_image of L_earlier M_challenges of the L_Intifada ."
a9j-fragment01,54,"But it will L_also be a M_challenge to us , L_Palestinians , M_summoning us to L_work more L_energetically towards the L_idea 's L_fulfilment ."
a9j-fragment01,55,"It would be a M_natural M_extension of the L_Intifada 's L_dual M_strategy towards M_disengagement from L_Israel , and the L_corresponding L_process of L_state M_building ."
a9j-fragment01,56,It would further M_naturalise and L_legitimise the M_evolving M_skeletal M_form of L_Palestinian L_independence .
a9j-fragment01,57,It would L_provide the L_multitudinous L_popular L_committees and L_activities with a more L_advanced M_form of L_organisation and M_structure .
a9j-fragment01,58,It would L_enable L_better L_planning and L_performance .
a9j-fragment01,59,"It would M_maximise L_civilian M_tactics of M_resistance and M_defuse the M_natural L_potential for L_violence , M_containing and L_eventually L_eliminating the M_marginal but L_intrusive L_phenomenon of L_collaborator L_activation by L_Israeli L_security L_authorities and L_collaborator L_execution by L_local L_Palestinians ."
a9j-fragment01,60,It would L_create a further L_fact that would M_put L_Israel on the M_spot .
a9j-fragment01,61,"L_Israel 's M_reaction , L_however M_hostile , could only further our L_cause ."
a9j-fragment01,62,"L_Arresting or L_deporting the L_tens of L_thousands of L_Palestinian L_professionals who would be L_employed in L_perfectly L_apolitical , M_harmless and L_humanitarian L_jobs can only further M_isolate the L_Israeli L_Government ."
a9j-fragment01,63,M_Half-way M_measures can only M_imply M_half-way L_success .
a9j-fragment01,64,A modus vivendi would L_also M_imply L_success .
a9j-fragment01,65,"In L_general , our L_policy should be to M_proceed with M_building our L_state M_block by M_block , without L_waiting to be M_given a M_gift of it through L_negotiations ."
a9j-fragment01,66,We should M_regard L_negotiations L_rather as the M_means by which we could L_establish M_formal L_agreements between our L_state and L_Israel .
a9j-fragment01,67,Such L_agreements can M_range from the L_issue of M_borders to the L_issue of M_free L_wave-lengths for our L_future L_television and L_radio L_networks .
a9j-fragment01,68,"In the L_meantime , we have the M_capacity to M_bring L_coherence and L_organisation to a M_whole M_range of L_activities , further L_consolidating the L_institutional M_linkage between the L_people in the L_occupied L_state and the L_PLO L_leadership ."
a9j-fragment01,69,"L_Entire L_departments can be M_set up , in L_health , L_foreign L_affairs , L_agriculture , L_trade , L_finance , L_education , L_justice , L_religion , L_information and L_social L_welfare ."
a9j-fragment01,70,"A M_pyramid L_administrative M_structure , L_establishing M_links from L_popular L_committees in L_villages L_right up to the L_Executive L_Committee of the L_PLO ( in its M_capacity as a L_Cabinet ) , can be L_established ."
a9j-fragment01,71,During the L_Intifada the L_people have been M_engaged in M_building the M_side M_walls .
a9j-fragment01,72,A L_government would L_provide the M_roof which would M_bring these M_walls M_together .
a9j-fragment01,73,It would M_add another L_necessary M_touch in the L_process of L_creating a L_Palestinian M_home .
a9j-fragment01,74,"L_Sari L_Nusseibeh , a M_leading L_Palestinian L_intellectual , is L_professor of L_philosophy at L_Bir L_Zeit , the L_West L_Bank L_university M_closed by the L_Israelis L_early L_last L_year ."
a9j-fragment01,75,His L_ideas are L_widely L_influential among L_Palestinians .
a9j-fragment01,76,L_Nusseibeh …
a9j-fragment01,77,‘ The L_Palestinian L_national M_movement inside and outside the L_occupied L_territories is an M_organic L_whole ’ L_PHOTOGRAPH : L_DAVID L_SILLITOE
ab9-fragment03,791,"The L_boy and the L_dog L_skirted L_round L_opposite L_sides of the L_puddle , the L_boy , a L_light , L_tall L_fourteen-year-old , M_labouring in L_wellington L_boots too L_large for him , and the L_dog , a L_three-year-old L_Labrador L_bitch , M_picking her L_way L_reluctantly , with L_frequent L_pauses , as if her L_paws L_hurt ."
ab9-fragment03,792,"The L_boy , unlike the L_dog , L_knew that the L_mud did not M_go on for L_ever ; beyond the L_bridge , the L_disused L_railway L_embankment along which they were L_walking L_became L_built up , so that L_water M_ran off it ."
ab9-fragment03,793,"He L_pulled the L_dog L_close to him to L_let a L_mixed M_string of L_horses and L_Ponies L_go L_past , L_waving L_shyly to the L_lead L_rider , a L_pretty , L_capable L_girl an L_unbridgeable two L_years L_older than him ."
ab9-fragment03,794,"He L_watched her as she L_went L_past at a L_walk , the L_black L_Labrador and he both L_gazing L_wistfully , their L_breath L_steaming in the L_cold L_February L_morning ."
ab9-fragment03,795,"He L_waited till the L_horses were L_well L_away and L_looked L_round the L_wide , L_flat L_landscape L_carefully before L_unclipping the L_lead ."
ab9-fragment03,796,"‘ L_Way you L_go , L_Patty , ’ he L_said M_softly , and the L_dog was off , M_hurling herself along the L_embankment , all L_paws and M_flying L_ears , after a L_rabbit who had been M_sitting in a M_patch of L_sun but L_disappeared with M_contemptuous L_ease as she L_came L_close ."
ab9-fragment03,797,The L_boy had been L_told L_unequivocally not to L_let her off the L_lead — the L_riding-school only M_used the L_land by M_grace of its L_owner and it was a L_shooting M_estate — but he L_hated L_keeping the L_dog L_straining at the L_lead and L_knew that she would L_always L_come to his L_call .
ab9-fragment03,798,"He L_stood for a L_moment L_laughing at her as she M_cast M_furiously for the L_vanished L_rabbit , and L_walked on , to M_catch her up , along the L_raised L_embankment ."
ab9-fragment03,799,"The L_trees had M_grown up beside it in the twenty-five L_years since the L_railway had M_closed , and the L_boy L_stopped every now and then to L_watch L_small L_birds L_hopping around the L_top L_branches ."
ab9-fragment03,800,"He L_particularly L_liked this M_stretch ; L_nothing but the M_odd L_tractor and the L_horses L_ever L_came down this L_embankment , and the L_birds were L_unworried by his L_presence ."
ab9-fragment03,801,"After half a L_mile he L_decided to L_turn off the L_embankment and L_walk up the L_side of the L_next L_field and along the L_path at the L_top of it , L_following the L_horses whom he could L_still L_see in the L_distance ."
ab9-fragment03,802,He L_called L_Patty to him .
ab9-fragment03,803,"She did n't L_come , which was L_surprising ; she was a L_docile L_creature and L_particularly L_devoted to him because he L_always L_took her for a L_walk when he was at the L_stables ."
ab9-fragment03,804,He could L_hear her L_barking and L_looked down over the L_steep L_side of the L_embankment to the L_bottom of the L_trees .
ab9-fragment03,805,"He L_called her again and again , but she would not L_stop L_barking at L_something he could not L_see ."
ab9-fragment03,806,"L_Probably a L_squirrel , he L_decided , and M_slithered down the L_side of the L_embankment to M_join her , L_scolding as he L_went ."
ab9-fragment03,807,"L_Straightening up beside the L_dog , he L_looked where she was L_looking , and L_blinked ."
ab9-fragment03,808,"He L_saw a L_leg , L_uncomfortably L_wedged between L_sapling L_trees , L_swollen L_grotesquely , and M_gazed at it , L_stupidly , L_wondering if it was L_plastic ."
ab9-fragment03,809,"As his L_eyes L_focused he L_realized he was L_looking at a L_hideously L_swollen L_human L_body , and just then , as the M_light L_breeze M_shifted , he M_caught the M_stomach-turning L_odour of L_decay ."

ab9-fragment03,878,"L_Miss L_Williams L_said L_quietly to him , L_sounding L_shaky ."
ab9-fragment03,879,‘ She did n't L_even L_look L_human . ’
ab9-fragment03,880,The M_sergeant M_confirmed that that L_happened with L_bodies after a few L_days .
ab9-fragment03,881,"‘ We 'll L_identify her , L_though , ’ he L_said , L_reassuringly ."
ab9-fragment03,882,‘ L_Somebody will L_likely have L_reported her L_missing . ’
ab9-fragment03,883,"He L_stopped , L_abruptly , as he L_remembered a L_conversation L_earlier that L_week , and M_lit a L_cigarette , L_thinking M_furiously ."
ab9-fragment03,884,"This could be the L_girl whom the L_Yard were L_looking for , and he had L_better do L_everything very L_quickly L_indeed , M_including L_finding his L_Chief , who would then L_want to L_find his L_Chief L_Constable and L_notify L_Scotland L_Yard ."
ab9-fragment03,885,"L_Presumably it would be the L_Yard who L_investigated this one , L_rather than the L_regional L_crime M_squad ."
ab9-fragment03,886,"He L_chewed his L_thumbnail as he L_walked , out of M_long L_experience M_keeping in L_mind the M_highest L_priorities : L_Ensure L_Body Not L_Moved and L_Ensure M_Next of L_Kin L_Notified before the L_Press M_got the L_story ."

ab9-fragment03,888,"Then he L_climbed into the L_Land L_Rover beside his two L_passengers and L_drove off L_fast , with the M_aim of L_abandoning L_Jamie to the L_custody of his L_aunt as M_quickly as L_possible ."
ab9-fragment03,889,"He could L_see with half an L_eye that the L_kid 's L_aunt was L_going to be one of the L_confident , L_bossy , M_well-connected L_women with whom that L_part of L_Cambridgeshire was M_substantially over-provided ."
ab9-fragment03,890,"L_John L_McLeish was in his L_office , L_Saturday or no L_Saturday , L_telling himself he L_needed to M_catch up on the L_paperwork ."

ab9-fragment03,895,"L_Sorry , what did you L_say it was again ? ’"
ab9-fragment03,896,‘ A L_little L_girl .

ab9-fragment03,899,I 've just L_left them and I 'm L_going L_back . ’
ab9-fragment03,900,L_McLeish L_repressed the L_malicious L_thought that this L_event might L_put L_Francesca 's M_nose just a L_little L_bit out of M_joint .
ab9-fragment03,901,She had been L_utterly L_secure in her M_position as the only L_girl in the L_Wilson L_family and now there was another one .

ab9-fragment03,904,L_McLeish L_expressed M_qualified L_enthusiasm and L_Charlie L_assured him he M_felt L_exactly the same about his L_younger L_brother .

ab9-fragment03,909,I L_know the L_little L_boys M_lean on her too L_much and I would have L_gone if I could . ’
ab9-fragment03,910,"He L_coughed , L_embarrassed and a L_little L_pompous , very L_much L_conscious of his L_new L_status as a L_father , while L_McLeish L_remembered that he was a L_scant four L_years L_older than the L_delinquent L_Tristram ."
ab9-fragment03,911,"‘ L_Anyway she should be M_back L_soon , ’ L_Charlie L_concluded ."
ab9-fragment03,912,"L_McLeish L_thanked him L_gravely , M_feeling , as he L_often did with the L_Wilsons , that he was being M_enveloped in a L_large L_feather M_eiderdown , and , M_made L_restless by the M_call , L_went down the L_corridor to where he L_knew L_Catherine L_Crane was L_also in , M_getting her L_office in M_order ."
ab9-fragment03,913,He L_stopped at the L_door and L_smiled at her .
ab9-fragment03,914,"L_Wearing L_jeans and a L_blue L_shirt , she was L_tugging at a L_filing L_cabinet which was too L_large for her to M_embrace and which was M_threatening to M_over-balance on her ."
ab9-fragment03,915,She L_looked about L_sixteen and L_beautiful .
ab9-fragment03,916,"She M_let M_go of the L_cabinet , L_coughing in the L_dust of L_ages that M_appeared to be M_lurking behind it , and L_smiled M_back at him as the L_February L_sun L_shone through the L_small L_window behind her , M_throwing into M_sharp M_relief the M_patches on the L_wall where her L_predecessor had L_hung L_posters , and the L_ingrained L_dirt on the L_flaking L_paintwork L_round the M_mean , L_narrow , L_metal L_window ."
ab9-fragment03,917,‘ Where do you L_want that L_put ? ’
ab9-fragment03,918,"L_McLeish L_advanced on the L_cabinet and L_shifted it L_authoritatively , L_ignoring the M_clip on the M_ankle L_dealt him by an L_unsecured L_bottom L_drawer L_apparently L_full of L_bricks ."
ab9-fragment03,919,"‘ I should have L_unloaded it L_first , ’ L_Catherine L_Crane L_said , L_apologetically , ‘ but I just could n't L_move in any L_direction with it where it was . ’"
ab9-fragment03,920,"‘ I 'm here , just L_tell me if you L_want L_anything L_else L_shifted . ’"
ab9-fragment03,921,He L_hesitated .

ab9-fragment03,923,"He was L_aware that he was not M_managing to L_sound L_exactly like a L_senior L_officer L_making a L_recent L_arrival M_feel at M_home , but L_decided not to M_add any further M_riders to his L_invitation ."
ab9-fragment03,924,‘ That would be very L_nice .
ab9-fragment03,925,Are we L_going to the L_canteen ? ’
ab9-fragment03,926,‘ Not if I can L_help it .
ab9-fragment03,927,What about the L_pub ?
ab9-fragment03,928,‘ If I 'm L_allowed to L_buy my own . ’
ab9-fragment03,929,L_McLeish L_considered .
ab9-fragment03,930,"‘ That 's L_fine on the L_food — I 'll L_buy the L_drinks , I 'm too L_old to L_get L_used to L_women L_buying my L_drinks . ’"
ab9-fragment03,931,"She L_laughed at him and L_said L_gravely that she would be L_happy to L_indulge him , and he L_went L_away , L_grinning ."
ab9-fragment03,932,"L_Peter L_Yeo was L_also in his L_office , having L_told his L_wife he was L_lunching with a L_client ."
ab9-fragment03,933,"It was , he M_felt , just too L_difficult to be at L_home at all , with L_Claudia in a L_permanently L_bitchy L_mood and both his L_teenage L_children M_taking their M_cue from her and L_behaving L_intolerably ."
ab9-fragment03,934,"He L_wandered L_restlessly about , and L_decided that the L_lie might as L_well M_become the L_truth ."
ab9-fragment03,935,"Without L_Angela L_Morgan , at L_least two L_major L_clients were in L_danger of not M_getting the M_assiduous L_service they were L_paying for , and it would be M_well M_worth L_trying to M_see if one of them , whom he L_knew to be a L_fellow M_refugee from L_family L_life at the L_weekends , could be L_found ."
ab9-fragment03,936,"He was in L_luck , and M_fixed to L_meet L_Andy L_Barton at L_Brazzo 's where L_Yeo L_Davis had a L_table L_permanently M_booked ."
ab9-fragment03,937,He had to M_admit that this L_particular L_client L_hardly M_added to the L_general L_decorative M_smartness of the L_place .
ab9-fragment03,938,"L_Andy L_Barton , L_founder and L_chief L_executive of L_Barton L_Textiles , was L_almost as L_broad as he was L_long , L_virtually L_neckless , with L_incongruously L_long L_brown L_hair L_curling over his L_collar ."
ab9-fragment03,939,"His L_enormous L_hands L_dwarfed the L_elegant L_menu which he was L_studying in L_apparent L_disbelief , and L_Peter L_Yeo L_noticed again , as L_Barton without L_rising L_extended one L_massive M_paw , that though the L_fingers were an L_ordinary L_length it was the L_width of the L_palms that M_made the L_hands so L_large ."
ab9-fragment03,940,"‘ I L_never M_see how they M_get the L_sales per L_square M_foot in these L_places , ’ L_Barton M_observed , without further L_greeting ."
ab9-fragment03,941,"‘ I L_mean , they 're not M_open twelve L_hours like my L_shops , and they are n't M_using the L_space . ’"
ab9-fragment03,942,"His L_small M_bright L_blue L_eyes M_swept L_disparagingly over the L_minimalized L_black and L_white L_flooring , L_stainless L_steel L_chairs and L_black L_wooden L_bar ."
ab9-fragment03,943,"‘ They M_make a M_huge M_margin on a M_smaller M_turnover , L_Andy , out of M_punters like us . ’"
ab9-fragment03,944,"L_Peter L_Yeo was L_amused by , and L_respectful of , a L_man with an L_obsession ."
ab9-fragment03,945,‘ L_Angela not L_working L_today ? ’
ab9-fragment03,946,"L_Barton L_worked a L_sixteen-hour L_day , which M_began with M_careful , L_detailed L_consideration of the L_trading L_figures and L_key M_ratios for every one of his L_forty-three L_major L_shops and the M_output of both L_factories , and L_continued , L_usually by L_helicopter , with a L_detailed L_aerial L_survey of a L_particular L_area as the M_quick M_way of M_identifying L_new L_sites , M_interspersed with L_unheralded M_descents on the L_manager of any L_shop he M_took a M_fancy to L_visit ."
ab9-fragment03,947,"L_Peter L_Yeo , who had L_known this L_particular M_juggernaut since he had his L_first L_small L_factory and two M_stores and L_dirt under his L_fingernails from L_shifting L_packing-cases L_personally , was not L_fazed by the L_question ."
ab9-fragment03,948,"‘ L_Angela 's M_taking a few L_days off — she has n't been L_well , ’ he L_said , M_easily ."
ab9-fragment03,949,‘ I L_know she 's been L_working very M_hard for you .

ab9-fragment03,951,L_Barton L_assured him M_warmly that L_Angela had done a M_great M_job and he was now L_confident of M_getting M_planning L_permission on the L_vast L_site he had L_wanted .

ac2-fragment06,1395,"They M_fell L_asleep in the L_early L_hours of the L_morning , L_holding L_hands ."
ac2-fragment06,1396,The L_next L_day L_Mark L_arrived M_back at L_UM 's L_European M_headquarters in L_London and L_received an L_early L_call from L_Muldoon .
ac2-fragment06,1397,"He L_went down the L_airless L_corridor to his L_Boss 's L_office , L_said hello to the L_secretary , and L_walked into the L_large L_oak-panelled L_room which was as L_big as the L_lobby of L_many a L_sizeable L_hotel ."
ac2-fragment06,1398,"L_Muldoon L_rose L_immediately from his L_enormous L_black L_leather L_chair to L_greet him , L_coming from behind the L_vast L_desk with L_hand L_outstretched ."
ac2-fragment06,1399,‘ Hello L_Mark .
ac2-fragment06,1400,Have a L_good L_trip ? ’
ac2-fragment06,1401,He L_took the L_Englishman by the L_arm and L_ushered him toward the L_easy L_chairs L_arranged around a L_long L_rectangular L_coffee L_table .
ac2-fragment06,1402,"L_Instinctively , L_Mark M_felt L_uneasy ."
ac2-fragment06,1403,Why the L_hand on the L_arm and the over-friendly M_approach ?
ac2-fragment06,1404,L_Muldoon L_never L_emerged from behind his L_desk to L_greet L_colleagues .
ac2-fragment06,1405,Only L_visitors and L_VIPs M_got that L_special M_reception .
ac2-fragment06,1406,L_Muldoon L_poured the L_coffee .
ac2-fragment06,1407,‘ How did the M_Planning L_meeting M_go ? ’
ac2-fragment06,1408,L_Mark L_asked him .
ac2-fragment06,1409,‘ What was L_Nate 's M_reaction ?

ac2-fragment06,1412,He L_seemed L_somewhat L_uneasy .
ac2-fragment06,1413,‘ L_Klepner did a L_good M_job . ’
ac2-fragment06,1414,‘ How did he M_handle the L_questions ? ’
ac2-fragment06,1415,L_Mark L_asked .
ac2-fragment06,1416,‘ He does n't have the M_inside L_knowledge to M_deal with L_questions . ’
ac2-fragment06,1417,"‘ Oh , L_OK L_really ."
ac2-fragment06,1418,I M_handled some and so did L_Mueller .
ac2-fragment06,1419,But L_Klepner did L_OK .
ac2-fragment06,1420,He did n't M_let the M_side down . ’
ac2-fragment06,1421,L_Mark L_nodded .
ac2-fragment06,1422,‘ What was L_Mueller doing L_answering L_questions .
ac2-fragment06,1423,He was there to L_ASK them .
ac2-fragment06,1424,He does n't L_know the M_inside M_track any more than L_Klepner . ’
ac2-fragment06,1425,"‘ L_Maybe not , but he L_soon will , ’ L_Muldoon L_replied L_quietly ."
ac2-fragment06,1426,‘ And what does that M_mean ? ’
ac2-fragment06,1427,L_Muldoon L_seemed to be M_taking a M_long L_time over his L_coffee .
ac2-fragment06,1428,He M_evaded L_Mark 's L_eyes .
ac2-fragment06,1429,‘ He 's L_goin' to M_head-up L_world M_planning L_operations from L_Detroit . ’
ac2-fragment06,1430,‘ He 's L_already M_co-ordinating the L_regional M_plans to L_provide a L_world M_picture .

ac2-fragment06,1432,M_Deep down he L_knew .
ac2-fragment06,1433,"‘ He 's not L_going to just M_co-ordinate and L_consolidate any L_longer , ’ L_Muldoon L_said , with M_increasing L_nervousness ."
ac2-fragment06,1434,"‘ He 's L_gon na M_plan , M_direct and L_control L_worldwide M_planning L_operations from L_Detroit , M_including the L_regional M_planning L_functions . ’"
ac2-fragment06,1435,L_Mark 's L_expression was one of M_faked L_incredulity .
ac2-fragment06,1436,His M_gut L_feelings had been L_right .
ac2-fragment06,1437,‘ You 've L_got to be L_joking ! ’ he L_scoffed .
ac2-fragment06,1438,"‘ I L_know that 's what L_Mueller 's L_always L_wanted , but L_Nate and the L_Executive L_Committee would L_never M_fall for that M_bloody L_empire-building M_game !"
ac2-fragment06,1439,The L_regions are M_far too L_big and L_complex to be M_handled from L_Detroit and L_even if they were L_foolish L_enough to L_believe that they could do it more L_effectively — which they ca n't — they would be L_crazy to L_try . ’
ac2-fragment06,1440,"‘ I L_know , L_Mark , I L_know , ’ L_Muldoon L_said ."
ac2-fragment06,1441,‘ But that 's what they 're L_gon na do . ’
ac2-fragment06,1442,"‘ It will L_boomerang , ’ the L_Englishman L_said M_heatedly ."

ac2-fragment06,1445,"‘ I L_know , L_Mark ."
ac2-fragment06,1446,But they L_think they can M_run L_everything from L_Detroit and that 's the M_way the L_organisation is L_going to be L_restructured .
ac2-fragment06,1447,They are L_working on it L_right now .
ac2-fragment06,1448,We will L_know the L_details in a few L_weeks ’ L_time .
ac2-fragment06,1449,L_Couple of L_months at the L_latest . ’
ac2-fragment06,1450,L_Mark L_said L_quietly :
ac2-fragment06,1451,‘ And how does that L_affect the L_European L_organisation ?
ac2-fragment06,1452,‘ The L_organisation will be M_wound up .
ac2-fragment06,1453,I 'm M_taking L_early L_retirement . ’
ac2-fragment06,1454,‘ And me ? ’
ac2-fragment06,1455,L_Muldoon L_shrugged .
ac2-fragment06,1456,‘ Not L_certain L_yet .

ac2-fragment06,1459,The L_Englishman L_snorted .

ac2-fragment06,1462,"In any L_case , you L_know as L_well as I do that the L_MDs are L_always L_American . ’"
ac2-fragment06,1463,"‘ L_Well , there wo n't be any L_European L_job L_functions , that 's for L_sure , ’ L_Muldoon L_said ."
ac2-fragment06,1464,"‘ There 'll be a M_direct M_link between L_Detroit and the L_line L_managers in each L_country , with L_Detroit M_calling the M_shots . ’"
ac2-fragment06,1465,‘ Do n't they L_realise they 're M_playing with L_political M_dynamite ?
ac2-fragment06,1466,L_Mark L_demanded .
ac2-fragment06,1467,‘ L_Mueller wo n't M_give a L_damn about the L_effect of a M_corporate M_plan on L_Europe and on L_individual L_countries .
ac2-fragment06,1468,"If he L_wants to L_import L_vehicles or L_components from L_Taiwan or L_Singapore or L_Hong L_Kong into L_Europe , he 'll M_go M_ahead and do it , L_regardless of the L_economic L_consequences for the L_European L_countries L_concerned ."
ac2-fragment06,1469,The only M_thing you can be L_sure of is that L_US L_interest will L_always M_come L_first .
ac2-fragment06,1470,"Oh , and there 's one more M_thing you can be L_sure of , ’ he M_added M_sourly ."
ac2-fragment06,1471,‘ They wo n't M_plan to L_supply the L_US M_market from L_imports .
ac2-fragment06,1472,You can L_bet your M_bottom L_dollar on that !
ac2-fragment06,1473,"L_Jesus L_wept ! ’ he L_continued , M_hackles M_rising ."
ac2-fragment06,1474,‘ L_Mueller will have the M_power to M_make or M_break L_whole L_areas of L_Europe .
ac2-fragment06,1475,He 's the L_last L_guy in the L_world who should be M_given such M_power .
ac2-fragment06,1476,The M_bloody L_man 's M_power M_drunk L_already . ’
ac2-fragment06,1477,He was L_angry and M_bitter .
ac2-fragment06,1478,"‘ I L_know , ’ L_Muldoon L_agreed L_sadly ."
ac2-fragment06,1479,‘ Then what are you and L_Clancy doing about it ? ’
ac2-fragment06,1480,"‘ M_Look , L_Mark , ’ L_Muldoon L_said L_forlornly ‘ What 's the M_point ?"
ac2-fragment06,1481,The M_wheels have L_already been M_set in M_motion .
ac2-fragment06,1482,We 're not L_gon na M_change L_anyone 's L_mind .

ac2-fragment06,1484,His L_tone was L_abject .

ac2-fragment06,1486,‘ How L_else should I M_take it ? ’
ac2-fragment06,1487,L_Mark L_demanded .
ac2-fragment06,1488,‘ It 's my L_life which is about to M_go down the M_plughole .
ac2-fragment06,1489,I 'm not an L_American on a M_brief L_overseas L_assignment .

ac2-fragment06,1496,What the L_hell do you L_expect me to L_say ?
ac2-fragment06,1497,"Oh , is that what they are L_proposing to do ?"
ac2-fragment06,1498,L_Well M_bully for L_Mueller and the L_Corporation ?
ac2-fragment06,1499,I 'll M_go and M_collect my M_hat and M_coat ! ’
ac2-fragment06,1500,"‘ I L_know how you M_feel , L_Mark , ’ L_Muldoon L_said L_sadly ."

ac2-fragment06,1502,Do you ?
ac2-fragment06,1503,You 're L_sixty-one and have been M_looking M_forward to L_retirement .
ac2-fragment06,1504,I 'm fifty and have a M_long M_way to L_go .
ac2-fragment06,1505,I do n't L_think you can M_see M_things the M_way I M_see them .
ac2-fragment06,1506,"‘ Well , L_perhaps not , ’ L_Muldoon L_agreed ."
ac2-fragment06,1507,‘ But I can L_understand how you M_feel . ’
ac2-fragment06,1508,The L_Englishman L_nodded and L_poured himself more L_coffee .
ac2-fragment06,1509,‘ So what 's L_going to L_happen to the L_European M_Plan ? ’ he L_asked .
ac2-fragment06,1510,"‘ L_Mueller will M_drive it from L_Detroit , with one or two L_amendments L_agreed at the L_EPC L_meeting , ’ L_Muldoon L_told him ."
ac2-fragment06,1511,‘ What L_amendments ? ’
ac2-fragment06,1512,‘ No further M_plant L_investment in the L_UK . ’
ac2-fragment06,1513,"‘ I L_suppose L_Mueller M_saw to that , ’ L_Mark L_said L_sarcastically ."
ac2-fragment06,1514,‘ He L_really L_hates our M_guts !

ac2-fragment06,1516,L_Muldoon L_shook his L_head .
ac2-fragment06,1517,"‘ No , it was n't that ."
ac2-fragment06,1518,It was the M_strike at L_Merseyside .
ac2-fragment06,1519,That was the L_last M_straw as M_far as L_Nate was L_concerned .
ac2-fragment06,1520,"Up until that L_news M_hit the L_Committee , Don had L_won the L_day with his L_UK L_Vehicle L_Division L_proposals ."
ac2-fragment06,1521,"But as L_soon as L_Nate L_heard about the L_latest M_strike , that was it ."
ac2-fragment06,1522,M_End of M_story .
ac2-fragment06,1523,He L_instructed L_Mueller to L_phase-out L_vehicle L_manufacture in the L_UK . ’
ac2-fragment06,1524,L_Mark L_nodded .
ac2-fragment06,1525,‘ How did Don M_take it ?
ac2-fragment06,1526,He was L_beginning to L_win through . ’
ac2-fragment06,1527,‘ He 's very L_upset .
ac2-fragment06,1528,L_Naturally .
ac2-fragment06,1529,It 's the L_first L_time in his L_career he has n't M_come out on M_top .

ac2-fragment06,1531,L_Public L_relations L_job or L_something L_similar .
ac2-fragment06,1532,"Just L_think of it , a L_man of his L_talent and L_ability M_stooging around the L_media . ’"
ac2-fragment06,1533,‘ So when 's he L_going L_back to the L_States ? ’
ac2-fragment06,1534,L_Mark L_said .
ac2-fragment06,1535,"‘ It wo n't be L_announced for a L_week or so , but he 's L_already been L_told ."
ac2-fragment06,1536,He 'll L_fly out inside the L_month . ’
ac2-fragment06,1537,‘ And what do you and I do now ?
ac2-fragment06,1538,L_Mark L_enquired .
ac2-fragment06,1539,‘ L_Start L_emptying the L_files ? ’
ac2-fragment06,1540,L_Muldoon M_made a M_face .
ac2-fragment06,1541,‘ L_Afraid so .
ac2-fragment06,1542,L_Klepner will L_take over the L_files and L_ship them M_back to the L_States .

ac2-fragment06,1544,‘ L_Klepner ? ’
ac2-fragment06,1545,L_Mark L_uttered in L_mock L_astonishment .
ac2-fragment06,1546,‘ The L_man L_knows L_nothing about L_Europe .
ac2-fragment06,1547,He 's a M_novice .

ac2-fragment06,1550,‘ But there it is .

ac2-fragment06,1552,"I was L_instructed to L_tell you , and I have ."
ac2-fragment06,1553,"L_New L_York and L_Detroit will M_come up with an M_attractive M_separation M_package , you can be L_sure of that ."
ac2-fragment06,1554,They 've L_already L_told me you 'll M_get the L_maximum M_terms L_permitted under L_British L_law .

ac2-fragment06,1556,The two L_men L_rose from the L_table L_together .

ac2-fragment06,1579,L_Millie and the L_secretaries of L_Pat L_Muldoon and L_Clancy L_McGillicuddy were all M_close L_friends .
ac2-fragment06,1580,They had M_got L_together over the L_weekend to L_discuss the L_implications of the L_confidential L_letter the two L_Americans had L_received from L_Randy L_Mueller on L_behalf of L_Nate L_Cocello .

ac2-fragment06,1585,This was n't it .
acj-fragment01,1,L_HOMICIDE
acj-fragment01,2,This L_chapter M_deals with the M_approach of the L_criminal L_law to L_behaviour which L_causes or M_risks L_causing L_death .
acj-fragment01,3,"L_Murder , L_manslaughter , and L_several other L_offences are M_discussed , and one L_recurrent L_issue here is whether L_English L_law M_responds M_proportionately to the L_different M_degrees of L_culpability L_manifested in L_cases where L_death is L_caused ."
acj-fragment01,4,7.1 L_DEATH AND L_FINALITY
acj-fragment01,5,"For L_practical L_purposes , the M_culpable L_causing of another L_person 's L_death may L_fairly be M_regarded as the most M_serious L_offence in the L_criminal M_calendar ."
acj-fragment01,6,"There is an L_argument that L_treason is a more M_serious L_offence , since it M_strikes at the very M_foundations of the L_State and its L_social L_organizations , but L_treason is so M_rare that it is L_surely L_permissible to L_treat L_homicide as the most M_serious M_form of L_crime ."
acj-fragment01,7,"The L_reason for this is not L_difficult to M_find : the L_harm L_caused by L_many other L_crimes is L_remediable to a M_degree , whereas the L_harm L_caused by L_homicide is L_absolutely L_irremediable ."
acj-fragment01,8,"L_Even in L_crimes of L_violence which M_leave some L_permanent L_physical L_disfigurement or L_psychological L_effects , the L_victim M_retains his or her L_life and , L_therefore , the L_possibility of further L_pleasures and L_achievements , whereas L_death is L_final ."
acj-fragment01,9,"This L_finality M_makes it L_proper to M_regard L_death as the most M_serious L_harm that may be L_inflicted on another , and to M_regard a L_person who L_chooses to L_inflict that L_harm as the most L_culpable of L_offenders , in the L_absence of some L_excuse or L_justification ."
acj-fragment01,10,"Although L_many L_deaths M_arise from L_natural L_causes , and L_many L_others from L_illnesses and L_diseases , each L_year M_sees a M_large L_number of L_deaths L_caused by ‘ L_accidents ’ , and L_also a L_number L_caused by L_acts or L_omissions which M_amount to some M_form of L_homicide in L_English L_law ."
acj-fragment01,11,"For 1987 the L_statistics M_show that there were some 20,000 L_accidental L_deaths , of which some 7,000 L_occurred in the L_home , 6,000 at L_work , and 5,000 on the L_roads ."
acj-fragment01,12,"By L_comparison , the L_number of L_deaths L_recorded as L_criminal L_homicide was 600 , which M_includes all the L_murders and L_manslaughters ."
acj-fragment01,13,"This L_figure is L_relatively M_small when L_compared with L_many L_American L_cities , but that is no L_cause for L_satisfaction ."
acj-fragment01,14,There are L_still L_awkward L_questions to be M_confronted .
acj-fragment01,15,"For L_example , are we L_satisfied that the 600 L_deaths L_recorded as L_homicide are in L_fact more M_culpable than all , or L_even most , of the L_deaths L_recorded as L_accidents ?"
acj-fragment01,16,"In other L_words , does L_English L_criminal L_law M_pick out the most L_heinous M_forms of L_killing as L_murders and L_manslaughters , or are the M_boundaries M_frozen by L_tradition ?"
acj-fragment01,17,Another L_question is whether the L_criminal L_law ought not to be M_wider in its M_application to L_activities which M_carry some L_risk of L_causing L_death than in other M_spheres .
acj-fragment01,18,"L_Thus , L_even if it would be L_excessive to M_sweep M_large L_numbers of the L_deaths now L_recorded as ‘ L_accidents ’ into the L_law of L_homicide , there may be L_sufficient L_justification for M_creating or L_enforcing L_offences M_designed to L_ensure L_safe L_conditions of L_work , L_safe L_goods , L_safe L_buildings , and so on ."
acj-fragment01,19,It was L_argued in L_Chapter 2 that the L_criminal L_law ought to M_spread its M_net M_wider where the L_potential L_harm is M_greater .
acj-fragment01,20,"It will be M_seen that L_English L_law does this up to a M_point , and in the L_process L_seems to M_accept social-defence L_arguments as L_reasons for M_departing from L_several of the L_principles M_set out in L_Chapter 3 ."
acj-fragment01,21,7.2 L_REQUIREMENTS OF L_CRIMINAL L_HOMICIDE
acj-fragment01,22,"L_English L_law M_distinguishes between the L_offences of L_murder and L_manslaughter , as we shall L_see , but the two L_crimes do have L_certain L_common M_elements ."
acj-fragment01,23,It must be L_proved that the L_defendant 's L_act or L_omission L_caused the L_death of the L_victim within a L_year and a L_day .
acj-fragment01,24,( The L_requirements of L_causation in the L_criminal L_law are M_discussed M_elsewhere . )
acj-fragment01,25,"The ‘ L_year and a L_day ’ M_rule is a M_legacy of L_times when L_medical L_science was so L_rudimentary that , if there was a M_substantial L_lapse of L_time between L_injury and L_death , it was L_unsafe to M_pronounce on whether the L_defendant 's L_conduct or some other L_event L_caused the L_death ."
acj-fragment01,26,"L_Nowadays the L_problem is L_quite the M_reverse : L_medical L_science is L_generally M_able to M_determine whether D's L_conduct L_caused the L_death , and L_innovations such as life-support L_machines L_mean that L_life can be L_prolonged for L_months and L_years in some L_instances ."
acj-fragment01,27,"In one L_recent L_case the L_victim of a L_stabbing L_died two and a M_half L_years after the L_incident , having been M_kept on a M_life-support L_machine for L_almost the L_entire L_time ."
acj-fragment01,28,"In L_principle , it L_seems L_unjust that a L_homicide L_conviction should not be L_possible in such a L_case , if all the other M_elements can be L_established and only the ‘ L_year and a L_day ’ M_rule M_stands in the M_way ."
acj-fragment01,29,"But the M_rule was L_confirmed by the L_Criminal L_Law L_Revision L_Committee in 1980 , on the M_ground that a L_defendant should not be M_left in L_peril of a L_homicide L_conviction L_indefinitely ."
acj-fragment01,30,L_Surely L_prosecutorial L_discretion should be L_enough to L_prevent L_unfair L_convictions L_years after the L_event .
acj-fragment01,31,The M_rule itself is out of L_accord with L_modern L_medical L_conditions and should be L_abolished .
acj-fragment01,32,M_DEFINING L_MURDER : THE L_INCLUSIONARY L_QUESTION
acj-fragment01,33,( a ) The L_Procedural M_Context
acj-fragment01,34,"If L_causing L_death is to be M_regarded as the most M_serious L_harm that can be L_inflicted , it would L_seem to M_follow that the most L_blameworthy M_form of L_homicide should L_result in the M_highest L_sentences M_imposed by the L_courts ."
acj-fragment01,35,"L_Indeed , L_many M_systems of L_criminal L_law M_impose a L_mandatory L_sentence for L_murder ( or whatever the M_highest M_form of L_homicide is M_called in that M_system ) ."
acj-fragment01,36,In some L_jurisdictions this is a L_mandatory L_sentence of L_death .
acj-fragment01,37,"In L_others , such as those in the L_United L_Kingdom , it is the L_mandatory L_sentence of L_life L_imprisonment ."
acj-fragment01,38,"Why should this L_penalty be L_mandatory , and not at the L_discretion of the L_court as in other L_offences ?"
acj-fragment01,39,One L_argument in L_favour of the L_mandatory L_sentence of L_life L_imprisonment is that it M_amounts to a L_symbolic L_indication of the L_unique L_heinousness of L_murder .
acj-fragment01,40,"It M_places the L_offender under the L_State 's L_control , as it were , for the L_remainder of his or her L_life ."
acj-fragment01,41,"This is L_often M_linked with a L_supposed L_denunciatory L_effect — the L_idea that the L_mandatory L_life L_sentence M_denounces L_murder as L_emphatically as L_possible — and with a L_supposed L_general L_deterrent L_effect , in M_declaring that there is no L_mitigation of L_sentence L_available for this L_crime ."
acj-fragment01,42,It might L_also be L_argued that the L_mandatory L_life L_sentence M_makes a M_substantial M_contribution to L_public L_safety .
acj-fragment01,43,"L_None of these L_arguments is L_notably M_strong , L_let L_alone L_conclusive ."
acj-fragment01,44,"The L_mandatory L_penalty does L_indeed M_serve to M_mark out L_murder from other L_crimes , but whether the L_definition of L_murder is L_sufficiently M_refined to M_capture the L_worst L_killings , and only the L_worst L_killings , M_remains to be M_discussed below ."
acj-fragment01,45,"Whether the L_life L_sentence is M_regarded as a L_sufficient L_denunciation in L_society L_depends on the L_public 's M_perception of what L_life L_imprisonment L_means : if it is L_widely L_believed that it L_results in an L_average of nine L_years ' L_imprisonment , the L_effect will be L_somewhat M_blunted ."
acj-fragment01,46,"The same L_applies to the L_general L_deterrent L_argument : its L_effectiveness L_depends on whether the L_penalty for L_murder L_affects the M_calculations of L_potential L_killers at all , and , if it does , whether L_life L_imprisonment is M_seen as L_significantly more or L_less M_severe than the L_alternative of a M_long , M_fixed-term L_sentence ."
acj-fragment01,47,"As for L_public L_protection , this L_depends on L_executive L_decisions with L_regard to L_release ; it M_fails to M_take into M_account whether it is L_necessary for L_public L_protection to L_keep ‘ L_lifers ’ in for so M_long ."
acj-fragment01,48,"This M_brings the M_discussion to a L_crucial M_point : what does the L_sentence of L_life L_imprisonment L_mean in L_practice , and what would be the L_alternative ?"
acj-fragment01,49,"What it L_means is that the L_time of L_release from L_prison is L_determined by the M_Home L_Secretary , on the L_advice of the L_Parole L_Board and the L_Lord L_Chief L_Justice , L_rather than by the L_judge at the L_trial ."
acj-fragment01,50,"In L_procedural L_terms , L_therefore , the L_life L_sentence L_involves a M_transfer of L_function : L_normally it is the L_judge who L_determines the L_sentence ( or at L_least its M_upper M_limit , since L_earlier L_release on L_parole may be L_possible ) , whereas a L_life L_sentence M_entrusts that L_function to the L_executive , who must L_first L_ascertain the L_opinions of the L_Lord L_Chief L_Justice and the L_trial L_judge ."
acj-fragment01,51,"The L_Home L_Office is not M_bound by those L_opinions , and L_appears to M_depart from them L_frequently ."
acj-fragment01,52,"In 1983 the M_Home L_Secretary L_imposed L_restrictions on the L_release of L_persons M_serving L_life for L_murders of L_police- and L_prison-officers , L_terrorist L_killings , L_murder during L_robbery , and the M_sadistic or L_sexual L_murder of L_young L_children , M_fixing a L_minimum of twenty L_years ' L_imprisonment for these L_offenders ."
acj-fragment01,53,"Whatever the L_justifications for M_introducing this L_policy , it M_serves to M_underline the L_fact that L_sentencing in L_murder L_cases is M_enacted without each L_case being M_considered M_individually , after L_hearing L_representations from the L_offender 's L_counsel , and without a L_sentence L_announced in L_court and L_subject to L_appeal ."
acj-fragment01,54,"At L_present , the L_executive M_takes L_decisions to L_release some L_murderers after only a few L_years and to L_keep L_others in L_prison for L_extremely M_long L_periods ."
acj-fragment01,55,"Should those L_decisions not be M_taken by the L_courts , in the same M_way as other L_sentencing L_decisions ?"
acj-fragment01,56,The L_answer L_sometimes M_given is that L_murderers should be L_treated L_differently because they are L_particularly L_dangerous : L_anyone who L_chooses to L_kill once can L_choose to L_kill again .
acj-fragment01,57,"But this L_argument will L_seem L_less M_persuasive when we have M_discussed L_cases of L_manslaughter by L_reason of L_diminished L_responsibility : where a L_murder is M_reduced to L_manslaughter , the L_judge has a M_wide L_sentencing L_discretion and may , L_according to the L_facts of the L_case , L_select a L_determinate L_prison L_sentence , a L_hospital L_order , or L_life L_imprisonment ."
acj-fragment01,58,"Those who L_kill and are L_convicted of L_manslaughter by L_reason of L_diminished L_responsibility are no L_less L_dangerous than those L_convicted of L_murder , and L_yet the L_judge has L_sentencing L_discretion in one L_case and not in the other ."
acj-fragment01,59,L_Considerations of this L_kind have M_led the L_House of L_Lords L_Select L_Committee on L_Murder and L_Life L_Imprisonment to L_recommend the L_abolition of the L_mandatory L_sentence for L_murder .
acj-fragment01,60,"In its M_place would be a L_sentencing L_discretion , which L_judges would L_use , in L_many L_cases , to M_mark the L_relative L_heinousness of the L_murder by a L_determinate L_prison L_sentence ."
acj-fragment01,61,"In L_cases where L_life L_imprisonment was L_thought to be the L_appropriate L_sentence , the L_trial L_judge would L_still L_specify — in M_open L_court — the L_number of L_years to be M_spent in L_prison , M_taking the M_gravity of the L_offence into M_account , and L_release would be M_determined by a L_judicial L_tribunal ."
acj-fragment01,62,Such a L_reform would M_bring L_improvements in L_natural L_justice without M_loss of L_public L_protection .
acj-fragment01,63,( b ) M_Degrees of L_Homicide
acj-fragment01,64,"L_English L_criminal L_law has two M_degrees of L_homicide , L_murder and L_manslaughter ."
acj-fragment01,65,"L_Many L_American L_jurisdictions have three M_degrees of L_murder — M_first-degree L_murder , L_requiring L_premeditation , and L_second- and M_third-degree L_murder , M_covering L_lesser M_shades of L_culpability ."
acj-fragment01,66,"In L_England there has been a L_proposal that we should do L_away with all these L_distinctions , M_leaving a L_single L_offence of L_criminal L_homicide ."
acj-fragment01,67,"That L_proposal , if L_implemented , would M_shift L_almost all the L_decision-making in L_homicide L_cases from the L_trial to the L_sentencing M_stage : the only L_issue of any L_consequence in most L_cases would be the L_sentence to be L_imposed , and all the L_distinctions now M_drawn at the M_stage of L_criminal L_liability would be M_reflected in the L_sentence L_alone ."
acj-fragment01,68,"The L_jury would have no M_role in most L_homicide L_cases , since a L_plea of L_guilty would be the L_norm ."
acj-fragment01,69,"L_Contrast this with the M_position in L_jurisdictions where there are three or more M_degrees of L_homicide : L_pleas of L_guilty to L_first- and second-degree L_murders would be L_less L_frequent , since there would be the L_possibility of L_argument in L_court ( if no M_bargain was M_struck L_beforehand between L_prosecution and L_defence ) , and the L_defence might M_succeed in L_persuading the L_jury to M_reduce the M_degree of the L_killing ."
acj-fragment01,70,"L_Moreover , the M_borderlines between the L_various M_degrees would M_raise L_questions of L_law , which would L_provide L_much L_opportunity for L_legal L_argument and for L_appeals ."
acj-fragment01,71,"The L_result would be that L_killings were L_classified and M_labelled in a more M_refined M_way , but at the M_cost of L_lengthy L_trials and L_mounting L_legal-aid M_bills ."
acj-fragment01,72,That M_cost is not L_difficult to L_justify where M_capital L_punishment is the L_penalty for M_first-degree L_murder .
acj-fragment01,73,"Where there is no L_capital L_punishment , L_however , the L_question of how L_many M_degrees of L_homicide it is L_desirable to have M_calls for M_careful M_weighing of the L_principle of L_fair M_labelling ( L_see L_Chapter 3.3 ( l ) ) against the M_cost and L_time L_arguments M_mobilised by the L_policy of L_efficient L_administration ( L_see L_Chapter 3.3 ( m ) ) ."
acj-fragment01,74,The M_structure of the L_English L_law of L_homicide is L_rather L_strange .
acj-fragment01,75,"Although there are two L_offences , L_murder and L_manslaughter , the L_latter M_includes two M_distinct L_varieties : ‘ L_voluntary ’ L_manslaughter ( L_killings which would be L_murder but for the L_existence of M_defined L_extenuating L_circumstances ) ; and ‘ L_involuntary ’ L_manslaughter ( L_killings for which there is no L_need to L_prove any L_awareness of the L_risk of L_death being L_caused , but for which there is L_thought to be L_sufficient L_fault to L_justify L_criminal L_liability ) ."
acj-fragment01,76,The L_arguments L_therefore M_tend to M_focus on three L_borderline L_questions : What is the L_minimum L_fault L_required for L_conviction of L_murder ?
acj-fragment01,77,What L_conditions are L_needed to M_reduce L_murder to L_manslaughter ?
acj-fragment01,78,And what is the L_minimum L_fault L_required for a L_conviction of L_manslaughter .
acj-fragment01,79,( c ) L_Requirements for L_Murder
acj-fragment01,80,"In L_English L_criminal L_law there are now two L_alternative L_fault L_requirements for L_murder : an L_intent to L_kill , or an L_intent to L_cause L_grievous L_bodily L_harm ."
acj-fragment01,81,What do these L_requirements L_mean ?
acj-fragment01,82,"Do they M_extend the L_definition of L_murder too M_far , or are they too M_narrow ."
acj-fragment01,83,"L_Intent to L_kill may be M_regarded as the most L_obvious and L_indisputable M_form of L_fault M_element for L_murder , but to some M_extent that L_depends on the L_meaning of ‘ L_intent ’ ."
acj-fragment01,84,"This has been the M_subject of a L_number of L_House of L_Lords L_decisions , and L_yet the L_definition is L_still not M_clear and M_settled ."
acj-fragment01,85,"L_Probably the most L_accurate L_statement would be that a L_person L_intends to L_kill if it is his or her L_purpose to L_kill by the L_act or L_omission M_charged , or if he or she L_foresees that L_death is L_practically L_certain to M_follow from that L_act or L_omission ."
acj-fragment01,86,"In this M_way , both L_purpose and L_foresight of L_practical L_certainty are M_regarded as M_part of the L_definition of L_intent , although there are other L_statements M_suggesting that L_foresight of L_practical or ‘ L_virtual ’ L_certainty is L_merely L_evidence from which L_intent may be L_inferred ."
acj-fragment01,87,How would this L_test be M_applied ?
acj-fragment01,88,"In L_many L_cases the L_word ‘ L_intent ’ is L_used without L_elaboration , but there are some for which a M_full L_explanation of the L_meaning of L_intention is L_necessary ."
acj-fragment01,89,"A L_fairly L_typical M_set of L_facts is L_provided by L_Nedrick ( 1986 ) , where D had a L_grudge against a L_woman and had L_threatened to ‘ L_burn her out ’ ."
acj-fragment01,90,"One L_night he L_went to her L_house , L_poured L_paraffin through the L_letter-box and on to the L_front L_door , and M_set it L_alight ."
acj-fragment01,91,One of the L_woman 's L_children L_died in the L_ensuing L_fire .
acj-fragment01,92,"When L_asked why he did it , D L_replied : ‘ Just to L_wake her up and L_frighten her . ’"
acj-fragment01,93,"A M_defence of this L_kind , a M_claim that the L_purpose was only to L_frighten and not to L_cause L_harm , L_requires the L_full L_definition to be M_put to the L_jury ."
acj-fragment01,94,"The L_question is : L_granted that D's L_purpose was to L_frighten , did he L_nonetheless L_realize that it was L_practically L_certain that his L_act would L_cause L_death or L_grievous L_bodily L_harm to L_someone ?"
acj-fragment01,95,The L_jury should L_answer this by M_drawing L_inferences from the L_evidence in the L_case and from the M_surrounding L_circumstances .
acj-fragment01,96,"What about the L_alternative M_element in the L_definition , an L_intent to L_cause L_grievous L_bodily L_harm ?"
acj-fragment01,97,"This has L_considerable L_practical L_importance , since this is all that the L_prosecution has to L_prove in L_order to L_obtain a L_verdict of L_guilty of L_murder ."
acj-fragment01,98,"It must be M_shown that the L_defendant L_intended ( which , again , M_includes both L_purpose and L_awareness of L_practical L_certainty ) to L_cause L_really L_serious L_injury to L_someone ."
acj-fragment01,99,"The L_House of L_Lords M_confirmed this M_rule in L_Cunningham ( 1981 ) : D L_struck his L_victim on the L_head a L_number of L_times with a L_chair , L_causing L_injuries from which the L_victim L_died a L_week L_later ."
acj-fragment01,100,"D M_maintained throughout that he had not L_intended to L_kill , but there was L_evidence from which the L_jury could L_infer — and did L_infer — that he L_intended to L_cause L_grievous L_bodily L_harm ."
acj-fragment01,101,"The L_House of L_Lords M_upheld D 's L_conviction for L_murder : an L_intent to L_cause L_really M_serious L_injury is L_sufficient for L_murder , without any L_proof that the L_defendant L_intended , or L_even M_contemplated , the L_possibility that L_death would L_result ."
acj-fragment01,102,Does the ‘ L_grievous L_bodily L_harm ’ M_rule M_extend the L_definition of L_murder too M_far ?
acj-fragment01,103,"If the M_point of L_distinguishing L_murder from L_manslaughter is to M_mark out the most L_heinous L_group of L_killings for the L_extra L_stigma of a L_murder L_conviction , it can be L_argued that the ‘ L_grievous L_bodily L_harm ’ M_rule M_draws the M_line too M_low ."
acj-fragment01,104,"In L_terms of L_principle , the M_rule L_requires L_justification because it M_departs from the L_principle of L_correspondence ( L_see L_Chapter 5.2(a) ) , L_namely that the L_fault M_element in a L_crime should L_relate to the L_consequences L_prohibited by that L_crime ."
acj-fragment01,105,"By M_allowing an L_intent to L_cause L_grievous L_bodily L_harm to L_suffice for a L_murder L_conviction , the L_law is M_violating a L_general L_principle , M_turning the most M_serious of its L_offences into a M_constructive L_crime ."
acj-fragment01,106,Why should it be L_necessary to ‘ M_construct ’ a L_murder L_conviction out of this L_lesser L_intent ?
acj-fragment01,107,"There are L_arguments in L_favour of this : L_death is M_final , L_murder is the L_gravest L_crime , and there is no M_significant L_moral L_difference between L_someone who L_chooses to L_cause L_really L_serious L_injury and L_someone who M_sets out to L_kill ."
acj-fragment01,108,"No L_one can L_predict whether a L_serious L_injury will L_result in L_death — that may L_depend on the L_victim 's L_physique , on the L_speed of an L_ambulance , on the L_distance from the L_hospital , and on a M_range of other L_medical and L_individual L_matters ."
acj-fragment01,109,"If one L_person L_chooses to L_cause M_serious L_injury to another , it should be L_presumed that he or she L_realizes that there is L_always a L_risk of L_death , and such L_cases M_show a L_sufficiently M_wanton L_disregard for L_life as to L_warrant the M_label ‘ L_murder ’ if L_death L_results ."
acj-fragment01,110,"The L_counter-arguments , which would M_uphold the L_principle of L_correspondence , are that M_breach of that L_principle is L_unnecessary when the M_amplitude of the L_crime of L_manslaughter M_lies beneath L_murder , and L_also that the L_definition of L_grievous L_bodily L_harm M_includes a L_number of L_injuries which are most L_unlikely to M_put the L_victim 's L_life at L_risk ."
acj-fragment01,111,"In the M_leading L_case of L_Cunningham L_Lord L_Edmund-Davies ( L_dissenting ) M_gave the L_example of L_breaking L_someone 's L_arm : that is a L_really M_serious L_injury , but one which is L_unlikely to L_endanger the L_victim 's L_life ."
acj-fragment01,112,So in L_practice the ‘ L_grievous L_bodily L_harm ’ M_rule M_goes further than the L_arguments of its M_protagonists would M_support .
acj-fragment01,113,"Would it be L_right , then , to M_confine the L_fault M_element in L_murder to an L_intent to L_kill ?"
acj-fragment01,114,"That would have the L_merit of L_simplicity , but would it M_strike the L_right M_note L_socially ?"
acj-fragment01,115,"There are M_powerful L_arguments in L_favour of L_saying that there are other L_killings where an L_intent to L_kill can not be L_established , and L_yet where the L_moral or L_social L_culpability is L_equal to that in most L_intentional L_killings ."
acj-fragment01,116,"Of L_course , one can not be L_adamant about whether they L_merit the M_label ‘ L_murder ’ , because that is a L_question of M_drawing the M_line between L_murder and L_manslaughter , which is not L_susceptible of any L_precise L_resolution ."
acj-fragment01,117,It is M_hard to L_argue L_conclusively that the L_category of L_murder should be M_smaller or M_larger ( unless the L_death L_penalty or a L_mandatory L_life L_sentence M_follows ) ; it is a L_question of L_social L_judgment .
acj-fragment01,118,L_Let us L_briefly M_consider some of the L_possibilities .
acj-fragment01,119,The L_fault M_element for L_many M_serious L_offences is L_intent or L_recklessness : why should this not L_suffice for L_murder ?
acj-fragment01,120,The L_question is whether all L_killings in which the L_defendant is L_aware of the L_risk of L_death are L_sufficiently M_serious to L_warrant the L_term ‘ L_murder ’ .
acj-fragment01,121,"One L_answer L_sometimes M_given is that they are not , because a L_driver who L_overtakes on a L_bend , L_knowingly M_taking the L_risk that there is a L_car L_travelling in the M_opposite L_direction , should not be M_labelled a L_murderer if a L_collision and L_death L_happen to L_ensue ."
acj-fragment01,122,This L_example M_assumes that a L_sympathy for L_motorists with M_overwhelm any L_tendency to L_logical L_analysis .
acj-fragment01,123,One might L_ask whether L_motorists are L_ever L_justified in L_knowingly M_taking L_risks with other L_people 's L_lives .
acj-fragment01,124,"L_Yet if the L_example is M_modified a L_little , so that the L_overtaking is on a L_country L_road at L_night and the L_risk is L_known to be M_slight , it L_becomes L_questionable whether the L_causing of L_death in these L_circumstances should be M_labelled in the same M_way as L_intentional L_killings ."
acj-fragment01,125,This is not to L_suggest that L_motorists should be L_treated L_differently .
acj-fragment01,126,"The M_point is L_rather that , L_even though L_knowingly M_taking L_risks with other L_people 's L_lives is L_usually L_unjustifiable , M_taking a M_slight L_risk is L_less M_serious than L_intentionally L_causing L_death ."
acj-fragment01,127,"In M_discussing the M_boundaries of L_murder , we are L_concerned with L_classification , not L_exculpation ."
acj-fragment01,128,"To L_classify all L_reckless L_killings as L_murder might be too M_broad , but the M_point M_remains that some L_reckless L_killings may be L_thought no L_less L_heinous than L_intentional L_killings ."
acj-fragment01,129,Can a L_satisfactory M_line be M_drawn here ?
acj-fragment01,130,One M_approach would be to M_draw the M_line by L_reference to the M_degree of L_probability .
acj-fragment01,131,L_Murder is L_committed in those M_situations where D L_caused L_death by an L_act or L_omission which he L_knew had L_death as the L_probable or L_highly L_probable L_result .
acj-fragment01,132,A L_version of this L_test of L_foresight of M_high L_probability is L_used in L_several other L_European L_countries ; it was M_introduced into L_English L_law by the L_decision in L_Hyam v.
acj-fragment01,133,"L_DPP ( 1975 ) , but M_abandoned in L_Moloney ( 1985 ) on M_grounds of L_uncertainty ."
acj-fragment01,134,A L_second M_approach is to M_frame the L_law in such a M_way as to M_make it M_clear that the L_court should M_make a L_moral L_judgment on the L_gravity of the L_defendant 's L_conduct .
acj-fragment01,135,M_Section 210.2 of the Model L_Penal L_Code M_includes within L_murder those L_reckless L_killings which L_manifest ‘ M_extreme L_indifference to the M_value of L_human L_life ’ .
acj-fragment01,136,"L_Scots L_law M_treats as L_murder L_killings with ‘ M_wicked L_recklessness ’ , a L_phrase which M_directs the L_court 's L_attention to the L_circumstances of the L_killing ."
acj-fragment01,137,"Both the Model L_Penal L_Code L_test and the L_Scots L_test may be M_reduced to L_circularity , L_however , for when L_one L_asks how M_extreme or how M_wicked the L_recklessness should be , the only L_possible L_answer is : ‘ M_wicked or M_extreme L_enough to L_justify the L_stigma of a L_murder L_conviction ’ ."
acj-fragment01,138,"L_Admittedly , the Model L_Penal L_Code does M_contain a L_list of L_circumstances which may M_amount to M_extreme L_indifference , which M_assists the L_courts and M_increases the L_predictability of L_verdicts in a M_way that L_Scots L_law does not , but the M_essence of both M_approaches is that there is no L_precise M_way of L_describing those L_non-intentional L_killings which are as L_heinous as L_intentional L_killings ."
acj-fragment01,139,"Their M_protagonists L_argue that the L_law of L_murder is so L_important L_socially that L_derogation from the L_principle of L_maximum L_certainty should be L_allowed in L_favour of more L_accurate M_labelling by the L_courts ; M_opponents L_argue that the L_principle of L_maximum L_certainty is L_needed here L_specifically to M_reduce the L_risk of L_verdicts L_based on L_discriminatory or L_irrelevant L_factors , such as L_distaste for the L_defendant 's M_background , L_allegiance , or other L_activities ."
acj-fragment01,140,"A L_third , more L_precise M_formulation M_derives from the L_recommendations of the L_Criminal L_Law L_Revision L_Committee in 1980 , L_namely , that a L_killing should be L_classified as L_murder in those M_situations where there is an L_intention to L_cause M_serious L_injury L_coupled with L_awareness of the L_risk of L_death ."
acj-fragment01,141,"Neither an L_intention to L_cause L_serious L_injury nor L_recklessness as to L_death should be L_sufficient on its own , but L_together they M_restrict one another , M_producing a L_test which both M_satisfies the L_criterion of L_certainty and M_marks out some L_heinous but L_non-intended L_killings ."
acj-fragment01,142,"A L_fourth M_approach , M_adopted by L_English M_law until 1957 and L_still in M_force in L_many L_American L_jurisdictions , is some M_form of L_felony-murder L_rule : L_anyone who L_kills during the M_course of a L_felony ( or , more L_restrictively , a L_serious L_crime of L_violence ) or whilst L_resisting L_arrest should be L_convicted of L_murder ."
acj-fragment01,143,"L_Thus L_stated , there is no L_reference to the L_defendant 's L_intention or L_awareness of the L_risks : the L_fact that D has L_chosen to L_commit L_rape , L_robbery , or another M_serious L_offence , and has L_caused L_death L_thereby , is M_held to L_constitute L_sufficient L_moral M_grounds for M_placing the L_killing in the M_highest L_category ."
acj-fragment01,144,"L_Plainly , this is a M_form of M_constructive L_criminal L_liability : the L_murder L_conviction is M_constructed out of the M_ingredients of a L_lesser L_offence ."
acj-fragment01,145,"L_Presumably the L_justification is that D has L_already M_crossed a M_high moral/social M_threshold in L_choosing to L_commit such a M_serious L_offence , and should L_therefore be M_held L_liable for whatever L_consequences L_ensue , L_however L_unforeseeable they may be ."
acj-fragment01,146,"The L_objections would be M_reduced if L_awareness of the L_risk of L_death was L_also L_required : in other L_words , if the L_test were the L_commission of a M_serious L_offence of L_violence plus L_recklessness as to L_death ."
acj-fragment01,147,"The L_effect of that L_test would be to L_pick out those L_reckless L_killings which L_occurred when D had L_already L_manifested M_substantial L_moral and L_legal L_culpability , and to L_classify them as L_murder ."
acj-fragment01,148,"Four L_alternative M_approaches have been L_described , and L_many L_others could be L_listed ."
acj-fragment01,149,"The M_point is that the L_traditional L_concepts of L_intention and L_recklessness do not , of themselves , L_appear to be L_sufficiently L_well M_focused to M_mark out those L_killings which are the most L_heinous ."
acj-fragment01,150,The L_law must M_resort to some L_kind of L_moral and L_social L_evaluation of L_conduct if it is to M_identify and M_separate out the most L_heinous L_killings .
acj-fragment01,151,"L_Many L_people might L_think that a L_person who L_causes L_death whilst L_using an L_unlawfully L_held L_firearm or L_explosives ought to be L_convicted of L_murder because there is , L_generally L_speaking , no L_excuse for L_using such L_dangerous L_equipment ."
acj-fragment01,152,"Some of the L_people L_thus M_covered would be L_armed L_robbers , L_others would be L_terrorists ."
acj-fragment01,153,"The L_armed L_robber might L_say that he had no L_intention of L_using the L_firearm , that he L_carried it with him L_simply to L_frighten the L_victim , and that it L_went off L_accidentally : if the L_jury L_believes that , should he be L_convicted of L_murder ?"

ahb-fragment51,707,By L_FRANCESCA L_SIMON
ahb-fragment51,708,L_DEBBIE L_ADAMS had to L_let her L_East L_End L_terrace L_house in L_London in a L_hurry when her L_husband was L_re-located to L_Ireland with two L_months ' L_notice .
ahb-fragment51,709,"She L_went to a L_local L_letting L_agency , L_Landlords of 41 L_Roman L_Road , L_Bethnal L_Green , L_London E2 , who M_found a L_tenant that L_day ."
ahb-fragment51,710,She L_also M_employed L_Landlords to L_manage the L_let .
ahb-fragment51,711,"As is L_common L_practice , L_Landlords M_kept the L_tenant 's M_deposit of £650 and M_told L_Debbie they would M_take their L_entire L_fee of £881 up M_front , so she L_expected no L_rent for the L_first L_month ."
ahb-fragment51,712,But L_July L_also M_passed without L_Debbie L_receiving any L_money .
ahb-fragment51,713,"‘ I L_phoned and L_said , ‘ Where 's the L_money ? ’ and was L_told there were L_problems with the L_book-keeper , who would be M_coming in to M_sort it out , ’ L_says L_Debbie ."
ahb-fragment51,714,‘ But L_nothing L_happened and I L_never M_heard from them . ’
ahb-fragment51,715,"She L_repeatedly M_phoned L_Landlords , but was L_either L_unable to M_get an M_answer or M_told that L_manager L_Howard L_Keizner was M_unavailable ."
ahb-fragment51,716,"L_Finally , after the L_third L_month M_passed with no L_rent L_received , L_Debbie L_phoned the L_tenants , L_asked them to L_pay her M_directly , and M_sent L_Landlords a L_recorded-delivery L_letter , which was L_returned , and L_finally one by L_ordinary L_post M_stating that L_Landlords were no L_longer M_employed as the L_managing L_agents ."
ahb-fragment51,717,"Because they had n't done any L_management , L_Debbie M_felt L_Landlords were M_entitled only to the 10 per L_cent M_tenant-finding L_fee and L_therefore L_owed her £2,400 ( 3 L_months ' L_rent plus the M_deposit ) ."
ahb-fragment51,718,In L_December 1991 she L_sued .
ahb-fragment51,719,"L_Landlords did n't M_acknowledge the L_writ , so in L_January L_Debbie 's L_solicitor L_requested a L_judgment in L_default for the M_full L_amount plus L_interest and L_court L_fees , a L_total of £2,453.24 ."
ahb-fragment51,720,"Just before the L_court was L_due to M_hear the L_request her L_solicitor L_received a L_cheque for £2,400 ."

ahf-fragment24,536,By L_MARTYN L_HARRIS
ahf-fragment24,537,"AT THE L_drop-in L_centre on L_South L_Meadowell , L_Labour L_candidate L_Paddy L_Cosgrove has L_dropped in to L_meet the L_people — L_mostly L_fat L_ladies in L_shellsuits with L_laps L_full of L_chips ."
ahf-fragment24,538,"‘ You all L_know me , ’ L_says L_Paddy , and a L_fat L_lady with L_good L_timing L_says , ‘ I do n't L_know you ."
ahf-fragment24,539,L_Never L_seen you in me L_life . ’
ahf-fragment24,540,"On the L_floor a L_toddler L_peels more L_chips from a L_congealed , L_bluish L_mass and L_feeds them to a L_baby ."
ahf-fragment24,541,Another M_digs the L_cream from the L_centre of a L_pink L_fancy and L_smears it in his L_hair .
ahf-fragment24,542,"L_Paddy L_Cosgrove , L_councillor and L_barrister , in L_candidates ' L_pinstripes , L_sits M_tensely on the L_edge of his L_plastic L_chair ."
ahf-fragment24,543,‘ I 'm a M_regular L_visitor to this L_estate … ’
ahf-fragment24,544,‘ Who does he L_say he is ? ’ L_says a L_second L_fat L_lady .
ahf-fragment24,545,"‘ That L_Liberal , L_Paddy L_Ashgrove … ’"
ahf-fragment24,546,‘ He 's L_better L_looking on L_TV … ’
ahf-fragment24,547,"‘ He 's only L_come because the L_press are here , ’ L_says the L_first L_fat L_lady ."
ahf-fragment24,548,And L_Paddy L_Cosgrove L_blushes .
ahf-fragment24,549,L_Political M_consciousness is M_low on the L_Meadowell L_Estate .
ahf-fragment24,550,"L_Turnout at the L_last L_election was around 50 per L_cent , and with the M_thinning of the L_electoral M_roll M_brought by the L_poll L_tax , will be L_even M_lower this L_time ."
ahf-fragment24,551,They are L_mostly L_Labour L_voters but L_several L_confuse their L_Labour L_candidate with the L_leader of the L_Liberal L_Democrats .
ahf-fragment24,552,"Very few L_know their L_MP is a L_Conservative , and L_hardly L_anyone that his L_name is L_Neville L_Trotter , M_defender of a M_slender 2,500 L_majority ."
ahf-fragment24,553,"By most M_measures L_Meadowell is the L_worst L_council L_estate in L_Britain , and L_probably the most L_notorious since the L_riots L_last L_September , which M_followed the L_deaths of L_joyriders L_Colin L_Atkins and L_Dale L_Robson in a L_police L_chase ."
ahf-fragment24,554,"In L_fact L_Meadowell is an M_Elastoplast L_name like L_Sizewell , L_invented in the 1970s to M_disguise what was L_already a M_running M_sore ."
ahf-fragment24,555,"When L_built in 1938 it was The L_Ridges , which is L_still what they L_call it L_locally — a L_slum L_clearance L_project on the L_north L_bank of the L_Tyne , 10 L_miles L_east of L_Newcastle ."
ahf-fragment24,556,"Its L_first L_inhabitants were L_shipyard and L_fishquay L_workers from the L_riverside L_towns of L_North L_Shields and L_Wallsend , who L_moved L_happily from their L_tumbledown L_terraces to these M_fine L_new L_houses with L_inside L_toilets and L_gardens ."
ahf-fragment24,557,"L_Many , like L_Ronnie L_Collyer , a L_retired L_shipyard L_worker , L_still L_live here and are L_still L_proud of the L_place ."
ahf-fragment24,558,"All the L_trouble , L_says L_Ronnie , is down to ‘ a few L_families who L_doa n't L_keep their L_young ’ L_uns in M_order ."
ahf-fragment24,559,And then the L_media M_coom down and M_blow L_everything up . ’
ahf-fragment24,560,"He has L_polished L_shoes , a L_close L_shave , and too L_much L_pride for a M_free L_drink ."
ahf-fragment24,561,"‘ It 's a M_canny L_place The L_Ridges , with L_plenty of L_good L_folk . ’"
ahf-fragment24,562,But L_something was L_wrong from the M_start .
ahf-fragment24,563,"Some L_say it was the M_importing of M_whole L_streets of M_fighting L_families from the L_fishquays , with their L_dockland M_diversions of L_prostitution , L_drug-dealing and M_handling ."
ahf-fragment24,564,"L_Others L_say it was the L_shortage of L_pubs , L_shops , L_churches , L_transport and L_police L_stations ."
ahf-fragment24,565,"By the 1950s , The L_Ridges was the L_criminal M_ghetto of L_Newcastle , and by the 1970s a M_costly L_council M_manicure L_job had L_turned it into a L_free-fire L_zone ."
ahf-fragment24,566,"L_Paths and M_boundaries M_vanished , M_allowing the M_tides of L_street L_life to M_wash L_right up to the L_doorsteps ."
ahf-fragment24,567,L_Joyriders L_used L_front L_lawns to L_practise their L_handbrake L_turns .
ahf-fragment24,568,L_Car L_theft L_became so L_common that L_private L_cars L_virtually L_disappeared from the L_area .
ahf-fragment24,569,"L_Shops like L_greengrocers and L_chippies , with M_pitiful L_cash L_takings , were L_routinely L_subjected to L_armed L_robberies with L_shotguns , L_balaclavas — the M_whole M_bit ."
ahf-fragment24,570,When I L_ask the L_fat L_ladies at the L_drop-in L_centre what is the one M_thing that would do most to L_improve the L_estate they L_say ‘ L_get L_rid of the L_kids ’ and they are only L_half L_joking .
ahf-fragment24,571,"The L_age M_structure of L_Meadowell M_means it is M_awash with L_teenagers , whose only L_pastimes are having L_babies and L_body-building ."
ahf-fragment24,572,Do your L_husbands L_come here ?
ahf-fragment24,573,"I L_ask , and they all L_laugh ."
ahf-fragment24,574,‘ The L_men are all M_useless — L_sitting L_indoors if there 's L_trouble in the L_street .
ahf-fragment24,575,It 's L_women have to L_go out and M_deal with it . ’
ahf-fragment24,576,By the L_time of the L_riots a L_quarter of all L_houses on the L_estate were L_boarded up and L_burned out by M_infant L_petrol L_bombers .
ahf-fragment24,577,L_Unemployment was 80 per L_cent on some L_streets .
ahf-fragment24,578,"In L_Meadowell L_Primary , which has 232 L_children , every L_one was L_receiving a L_clothing L_grant ."
ahf-fragment24,579,"The L_area had L_effectively been M_abandoned by the L_authorities , a L_fact which L_became M_clear during the L_riot itself , when L_police L_waited five L_hours to L_enter the L_estate and M_put down the L_disturbances ."
ahf-fragment24,580,"‘ And there were L_never more than a few L_dozen L_ringleaders , ’ L_Bob L_Mather , a L_local L_butcher , L_tells me ."
ahf-fragment24,581,"‘ I was L_stood outside me L_shop all L_night , and most were no more than L_kids . ’"
ahf-fragment24,582,Eight L_months on and L_little has L_changed — if L_anything it is L_rather L_worse .
ahf-fragment24,583,L_Unemployment is up another 17 per L_cent ; more L_houses and L_shops are L_boarded up ; L_burglaries and L_joyriding L_continue — and if there is L_less L_ram-raiding it is only because 50 or so of the M_hardest L_cases are L_still behind M_bars .
ahf-fragment24,584,"A L_food L_co-op which M_tried to L_replace the L_burned-out L_shops has been L_closed after L_several L_break-ins , and L_even the L_drop-in L_centre is L_burgled L_weekly , L_according to L_project L_worker L_Sheila L_Auld ."
ahf-fragment24,585,"There is a L_new L_phone L_box , L_ripped from the L_wall and L_lying on the L_floor of her L_office to L_prove it ."
ahf-fragment24,586,"L_Meadowell has L_even M_discovered a L_new L_martyr in the L_shape of one L_Willy L_Hunter , a L_local M_hard M_nut L_awaiting L_trial for L_murder , and L_allegedly the M_victim of a L_police L_frame-up ."
ahf-fragment24,587,"‘ L_Free L_Willy L_Hunter ’ M_say the L_graffiti , L_next to the L_old , L_fading L_graffiti for L_Dale L_Robson and L_Colin L_Atkins ."
ahf-fragment24,588,"My L_friend L_Kevin , L_muscleman and L_minicab L_driver , L_says the L_lads would be out L_rioting for L_Willy now if it was n't M_tipping down with L_rain the M_whole L_time ."
ahf-fragment24,589,"A few M_things have been L_achieved , I L_suppose ."
ahf-fragment24,590,"There are some L_posh L_flats L_going up at L_neighbouring L_Royal L_Quays which will L_provide L_building L_jobs : ‘ It 's M_Sun M_City in the L_middle of M_Bantustan , ’ a L_Labour L_councillor L_said to me ."
ahf-fragment24,591,The L_Cheviot L_housing L_association is M_slowly L_taking over L_property in L_South L_Meadowell .
ahf-fragment24,592,A L_new L_police L_station is to be L_built .
ahf-fragment24,593,"The L_government L_sponsored L_Meadowell L_Initiative M_makes M_noises in the L_north of the L_estate — but does M_pitifully L_little , M_painfully M_slowly ."
ahf-fragment24,594,L_North L_Tyneside L_council M_says it is too M_starved of L_funds by M_central L_government to do L_much .
ahf-fragment24,595,"L_Tory L_ministers , like L_Michael L_Heseltine who L_visited L_Meadowell L_last L_November , L_say the L_cash L_shortages are L_due to L_council L_profligacy and L_bad L_management ."
ahf-fragment24,596,"L_MP L_Neville L_Trotter is a M_pear-shaped L_Tory with M_pear-shaped L_vowels who has L_little M_appeal to the L_people of L_Meadowell , and a L_dwindling M_appeal in the L_middle-class L_suburbs where L_unemployment is L_also M_climbing ."
ahf-fragment24,597,"L_Paddy L_Cosgrove , his L_likely L_replacement , is a L_council M_hack of 21 L_years L_standing and L_ideal L_backbench M_fodder , though it is M_hard to L_imagine him M_leading a M_crusade for L_Meadowell ."
ahf-fragment24,598,When I L_ask the L_people of the L_estate what they L_want from this L_election some L_say they L_want L_Cheviot to M_rebuild it and L_others that it would be L_better L_grassed over .
ahf-fragment24,599,Some L_say they should M_bring M_back L_hanging ; L_others L_say it is the L_politicians they should L_hang ; but most L_say there is L_nothing L_anybody can do at all .

ahf-fragment63,1155,"M_Sit , they L_said , but he would n't This L_week L_John L_Major L_began to L_appear on a L_different L_kind of M_box ."
ahf-fragment63,1156,"In the L_last of his L_series on the L_leaders , L_Frank L_Johnson L_reports"
ahf-fragment63,1157,By L_FRANK L_JOHNSON
ahf-fragment63,1158,WE WERE in the L_West L_Country .
ahf-fragment63,1159,The L_Prime L_Minister was on his M_soapbox .
ahf-fragment63,1160,"Just up the L_road , at L_Langport in L_Somerset , was the L_birthplace of L_Walter L_Bagehot ( 1826–1877 ) , although as he M_directed his L_microphone at L_Liberal L_Democrat L_hecklers L_John L_Major had other M_things on his L_mind ."
ahf-fragment63,1161,The L_relevance is that L_Bagehot was the L_first L_political L_commentator .
ahf-fragment63,1162,"The L_travelling M_chaos of a L_modern L_party L_leader 's L_election L_entourage had M_carried L_Major within a few L_miles of the L_home of the L_founder of the L_profession , a few of whose more L_troublesome L_contemporary L_practitioners are L_said to have L_caused him L_much M_irritation over the 16 L_months of his L_premiership ."
ahf-fragment63,1163,‘ A L_Liberal ?
ahf-fragment63,1164,He 's M_admitted to being a L_Liberal ! ’
ahf-fragment63,1165,"L_Major L_cried , L_jabbing a L_finger in the L_direction of one L_heckler ."
ahf-fragment63,1166,The L_man had a L_Liberal L_Democrat L_rosette L_pinned to his L_cap .
ahf-fragment63,1167,"He was L_also L_carrying an L_orange L_poster on a L_pole , M_urging a L_vote for the L_local L_Liberal L_Democrat L_candidate ."
ahf-fragment63,1168,L_Therefore the L_admission which the L_Prime L_Minister M_wrung from him could L_hardly be L_said to have been L_grudging .
ahf-fragment63,1169,"But , like all the L_best L_soapbox L_orators , L_Major had M_prepared his L_repartee in M_advance ."
ahf-fragment63,1170,"‘ I L_knew there was one here , ’ he L_continued , L_meaning L_Liberal L_Democrats ."
ahf-fragment63,1171,"There were , in L_fact , about a M_score ."
ahf-fragment63,1172,"Then M_came the M_passage , which L_appeared on the L_television L_news that L_evening and in the L_papers the M_next L_day , about the L_Liberal L_Democrats being the M_Trojan M_horse that would M_let L_Labour in ."
ahf-fragment63,1173,There were L_also some M_lines L_intended for L_local M_consumption : ‘ M_Higher L_petrol L_prices from the L_Liberal L_Democrats … that 's not L_gon na M_help a L_rural L_area …
ahf-fragment63,1174,’ What would L_Bagehot have M_made of him ?
ahf-fragment63,1175,"Like the L_heckler , he was a L_Liberal ."
ahf-fragment63,1176,"There the L_similarity L_ends , since M_judging from his L_writings L_Bagehot was a M_roaring L_snob , whereas M_judging from his L_heckles the L_heckler was not ."
ahf-fragment63,1177,"More to the M_point , it was L_Bagehot who L_said : ‘ A M_constitutional L_statesman is in L_general a L_man of L_common L_opinions and L_uncommon L_abilities . ’"
ahf-fragment63,1178,The L_statesman to whom he was M_referring was L_Peel .
ahf-fragment63,1179,"A L_political L_commentator of our own L_day , L_Paul L_Johnson , L_quoted it not L_long after L_Major L_became L_Prime L_Minister to M_suggest that it was L_also L_true of him ."
ahf-fragment63,1180,But is it L_still ?
ahf-fragment63,1181,"B L_AGEHOT 'S L_phrase M_comes in a M_passage in which he L_appears to L_propound the L_dispiriting L_theory that a L_politician , if he L_wants to M_get M_anywhere , must M_appeal to ‘ the M_average L_man ’ ."
ahf-fragment63,1182,"The M_average L_man is ‘ a M_cool , L_common L_person , with a M_considerate L_air , with L_figures in his L_mind , with his own L_business to M_attend to , with a L_set of L_ordinary L_opinions M_arising from and M_suited to L_ordinary L_life ."
ahf-fragment63,1183,He ca n't M_bear L_novelty or L_originalities …
ahf-fragment63,1184,L_Original L_theories M_give L_trouble ’ .
ahf-fragment63,1185,"L_Bagehot M_goes on to L_say of L_Peel : ‘ From a L_certain L_peculiarity of L_intellect and L_fortune , he was L_never in M_advance of his L_time ."
ahf-fragment63,1186,"Of L_almost all the M_great M_measures with which his L_name is L_associated , he L_attained M_great L_eminence as an L_opponent before he L_attained L_even M_greater L_eminence as their M_advocate . ’"
ahf-fragment63,1187,That L_last L_sentence has more to do with L_Kinnock than with L_Major .
ahf-fragment63,1188,"It is L_also a L_warning to all M_hack L_Tories who L_think that it is a L_telling M_blow against L_Kinnock to L_keep on M_pointing out that he has M_reversed his L_opinions about L_unilateral L_nuclear L_disarmament , L_British L_membership of the L_EC , or L_anything L_else ."
ahf-fragment63,1189,"But the most L_striking M_thing about L_Bagehot 's L_essay on L_Peel , in the L_light of the L_last M_full L_week of this L_election M_campaign , is that it L_simply does not M_apply to L_Major at all ."
ahf-fragment63,1190,L_Common L_opinions were what M_got L_Major into L_difficulties in the L_first M_place .
ahf-fragment63,1191,"Between his L_becoming L_Prime L_Minister and his L_party 's M_fall in the L_polls about 10 L_days L_ago , L_Major did L_nearly L_everthing that L_common L_opinion M_wanted him to do ."
ahf-fragment63,1192,This was M_true of what he did about both M_high L_policy and M_low L_politics .
ahf-fragment63,1193,"For L_example , on M_high L_policy L_common L_opinion M_said that there was L_nothing for it but to M_stay in the L_ERM ."
ahf-fragment63,1194,"He M_stayed in , and the L_recession L_worsened ."
ahf-fragment63,1195,"In M_low L_politics , L_common L_opinion — no L_less L_common for being L_expensively M_hired by L_Conservative L_Central L_Office — M_encouraged him in the L_belief that he should M_fight L_much of the L_election L_sitting down ."
ahf-fragment63,1196,"He did so , and he L_looked like the L_questioner in the L_studio L_audience L_rather than the L_answerer ."
ahf-fragment63,1197,"The L_result was L_Wobbly L_Week , the L_second L_week of the M_campaign ."
ahf-fragment63,1198,But L_last L_Saturday L_Major M_climbed on to that M_soapbox in L_Luton .
ahf-fragment63,1199,"Until then , he had been that most L_inhuman of L_creatures — the L_public L_figure L_described by L_others as ‘ very L_human ’ ."
ahf-fragment63,1200,"Now he L_really was L_human — L_unscripted , L_jokey , L_even a L_bit L_passionate ."
ahf-fragment63,1201,The M_jubilant L_word from L_Kinnock 's M_camp was that L_Major was L_behaving more like an L_opposition L_leader than a L_prime L_minister .
ahf-fragment63,1202,But there L_seemed L_nothing L_wrong with the M_head of L_government L_appearing to be the M_challenger on the L_hustings .
ahf-fragment63,1203,"L_President L_Truman did so in a M_campaign which L_no-one L_expected him to L_win , and he L_won ."
ahf-fragment63,1204,It is M_justified if the M_head of L_government is M_challenging L_something M_powerful .
ahf-fragment63,1205,"L_Kinnock L_complains of the L_alleged L_power of the L_Tory L_tabloid L_press , but he has M_powers on his M_side too ."
ahf-fragment63,1206,"Ninety per L_cent of his L_party 's L_cash M_comes from the L_unions , which will M_expect a M_return ."
ahf-fragment63,1207,The L_British L_people have in the L_past M_found them L_rather more M_powerful than the L_corporations which are L_popularly L_supposed to L_finance the L_Conservative L_party .
ahf-fragment63,1208,"Then there are all those L_schoolteachers , dons , L_television L_producers , L_writers on L_arts L_pages and M_members of the L_agitating L_classes who M_want a L_Labour L_win in L_order to L_impose L_Political L_Correctness ."
ahf-fragment63,1209,"That is to L_say , they will have what the L_Jesuits once M_attached such L_importance to : M_power over L_young or L_impressionable L_minds ."
ahf-fragment63,1210,"As the L_week M_went by , L_Major L_rejected L_common L_opinion about two other M_large M_subjects : L_proportional L_representation and L_Scottish L_devolution ."
ahf-fragment63,1211,"He M_hardened his L_opposition to both , despite the L_fact that his own L_party L_chairman had once L_favoured the L_first , and L_vocal M_forces within his L_Scottish L_party were in L_support of the L_second ."
ahf-fragment63,1212,"E L_VEN at this L_late L_hour , L_psephology , L_demographics and L_luck M_suggest that the L_Tories could L_still M_emerge as the M_biggest L_single L_party in a M_hung L_Parliament ."
ahf-fragment63,1213,Is it L_possible that L_Major would L_rather M_go into L_opposition — with the M_dangers that would M_mean for his L_continued L_leadership of the L_Conservative L_party — than L_offer L_PR and L_Scottish L_devolution to the L_Liberal L_Democrats ?
ahf-fragment63,1214,"If so , we are M_dealing with a more L_Quixotic , L_romantic or L_principled L_figure than some of us L_used to L_think ."
ahf-fragment63,1215,"Once that M_soapbox M_came out , L_Major L_campaigned as if he would now do and L_say what he L_really L_thought ."
ahf-fragment63,1216,Was it too L_late ?
ahf-fragment63,1217,"From L_Central L_Office , and from around his L_entourage , M_came the L_unmistakable M_signs of M_fair-weather L_friends M_preparing to M_detach themselves from L_blame for L_defeat ."
ahf-fragment63,1218,"And then , on L_Thursday L_morning , when L_Major 's L_election L_tour M_reached the L_Daily L_Mail L_Ideal L_Home L_Exhibition , L_Sir L_David L_English , the L_paper 's L_editor , was not there to L_greet him ."
ahf-fragment63,1219,"A M_junior L_spin L_doctor is L_reported to have L_muttered , though L_admittedly out of my L_earshot : ‘ We 've been L_snubbed . ’"
ahf-fragment63,1220,Not L_Sir L_David !
ahf-fragment63,1221,"Some in the L_profession of L_political L_commentating would L_opt for L_Bagehot as their L_formative L_influence , but L_mine has L_long been L_Sir L_David — a L_founder of L_biased L_Tory L_journalism ."
ahf-fragment63,1222,His L_lack of L_humbug about L_political M_balance has L_always M_made him more L_honest than all the L_employees of L_BBC L_Current L_Affairs L_awaiting with L_glee the L_Kinnock L_years .
ahf-fragment63,1223,"L_Eventually , L_Sir L_David 's L_office M_issued a L_statement about the L_Prime L_Minister ."
ahf-fragment63,1224,"L_Normally , a L_prime L_minister 's L_office would M_issue a L_statement about an L_editor ."
ahf-fragment63,1225,"But L_Major M_makes a M_point of not being L_grand , and with L_Sir L_David it is the other M_way about ."

ahl-fragment02,7,"They L_believe they have M_found a L_cheap , L_practical M_means of L_preventing L_dolphins L_entangling themselves in L_monofilament L_drift L_fishing L_nets — the ‘ M_walls of L_death ’ L_believed to be M_responsible for L_killing L_large L_numbers of L_dolphins off L_Cornwall this L_year ."
ahl-fragment02,8,But their L_work is M_hampered by L_lack of L_money .
ahl-fragment02,9,"So M_far they have M_received L_nothing from the L_Government , L_little L_EC M_assistance and are M_running out of L_funds M_donated by L_individuals and L_industry ."
ahl-fragment02,10,"The L_researchers , M_headed by L_Dr L_Margaret L_Klinowska , a L_Cambridge L_biologist , and L_David L_Goodson , an L_expert on L_acoustic L_engineering at L_Loughborough L_University , M_say M_new L_data M_shows that L_plastic L_sound M_reflectors to L_fishing L_nets can M_warn L_dolphins of L_hazards ."
ahl-fragment02,11,"L_Data to be L_published L_shortly L_draws on L_experiments L_including L_observations of L_Freddy , the L_dolphin that has been L_living off the L_Northumbrian L_coast for four L_years ."

ahl-fragment02,15,"L_Echoes of the L_signal M_alert them to L_possible L_prey , at L_ranges up to 80–90 L_metres in L_shallow L_waters ."
ahl-fragment02,16,"L_Mr L_Goodson , who L_became L_interested in the L_sonar M_capacity of L_dolphins after L_hearing one while L_swimming off the L_Welsh L_coast , has M_experimented with L_various L_shapes of L_sound M_reflectors ."
ahl-fragment02,17,"The most L_promising is L_eliptical , about 3½in L_long ."
ahl-fragment02,18,"The L_theory is that its L_internal L_air L_pocket will ‘ M_bounce ’ M_back the L_dolphin 's L_sonar L_signal , L_regardless of the L_direction of L_approach ."
ahl-fragment02,19,"L_Last L_autumn , L_Dr L_Klinowska , L_Mr L_Goodson and their M_team M_put the L_theories into L_practice ."
ahl-fragment02,20,"In the L_Moray L_Firth , they L_placed a ‘ M_headline M_barrier ’ , from which they had L_suspended M_reflectors at L_two-metre L_intervals ."
ahl-fragment02,21,"The L_movement of L_dolphins around the M_barrier was L_observed , L_using L_electronic L_equipment to L_monitor L_sonar M_activity ."
ahl-fragment02,22,"‘ The L_results L_exceeded our L_expectations , ’ L_said L_Mr L_Goodson ."
ahl-fragment02,23,"L_Dolphins L_swimming near the M_barrier L_altered their L_behaviour to L_avoid it , the L_result , the L_scientists L_believe , of them M_detecting L_sonar L_echoes from the M_reflectors ."
ahl-fragment02,24,"L_Dr L_Klinowska L_said that , although it was L_necessary to be L_cautious about the L_findings , a L_combination of M_reflector L_devices and some L_modification of L_fishing L_gear might M_reduce L_deaths ."

al0-fragment06,179,"The L_perils of L_ignoring this L_advice were L_well M_illustrated by L_Angel of L_Bengal ( C4 ) , the L_True L_Stories L_documentary by L_Anna L_Raphael which was by M_turns L_hilarious and L_enraging ."
al0-fragment06,180,The ‘ M_angel ’ in L_question was an L_American L_woman who L_calls herself L_Rytasha .
al0-fragment06,181,"L_Apart from a L_particularly M_vicious-looking L_nose-job and L_alarming L_turquoise-coloured L_contact L_lenses , L_Rytasha is L_rather L_beautiful , and in the 1970s , when she M_went by the L_name of L_Ricki , she was a L_successful M_model ( she L_began L_life as L_Maxine L_Shenkman ) ."

alp-fragment01,1,a L_Non-punitive L_Paradigm of L_Probation L_Practice : Some L_Sobering Thoughts L.R. L_SINGER
alp-fragment01,2,L_Lawrence L_Singer is an L_Assistant L_Chief L_Probation L_Officer with L_Merseyside L_Probation L_Service .
alp-fragment01,3,L_Beforehand he L_worked as a L_probation L_officer for L_Berkshire L_Probation L_Service and L_later as a L_research L_officer for L_Somerset L_Probation L_Service where he L_undertook the L_research L_reported here .
alp-fragment01,4,"The L_paradigm which is L_described M_originates from L_doctoral L_research into L_generic L_probation L_practice and has been M_presented in a L_book L_Adult L_Probation and L_Juvenile L_Supervision : M_Beyond the L_Care-Control L_Dilemma ( 1989 , L_Gower ) ."
alp-fragment01,5,L_SUMMARY
alp-fragment01,6,"The L_Government L_White L_Paper L_Crime , L_Justice and L_Protecting the L_Public M_proposes a L_radical L_change for L_probation L_practice ."
alp-fragment01,7,L_Henceforth L_probation L_work will no L_longer be an L_alternative to L_punishment but an L_alternative M_form of L_punishment .
alp-fragment01,8,This L_article M_challenges the L_conceptual and L_practical L_appropriateness of M_applying the L_notion of L_punishment to the L_probation M_context .
alp-fragment01,9,"L_Probation L_officers , it is L_argued , are L_concerned with L_establishing M_rules for L_probationers and not L_inflicting M_pain on them ."
alp-fragment01,10,An L_alternative L_non-punitive L_paradigm of L_probation L_practice is L_described .
alp-fragment01,11,"The L_paradigm is M_based on the L_joint L_supervisory M_aims of M_support and L_surveillance which are L_implemented through the L_methods of L_counselling , L_assisting , L_directing , and L_monitoring ."
alp-fragment01,12,"To M_illustrate the L_paradigm , L_reference is M_made to an L_alcohol L_education M_course L_developed for L_offenders in L_trouble through L_drink ."
alp-fragment01,13,The L_efficacy of the L_alcohol L_project and the L_non-punitive L_paradigm is L_demonstrated by the L_results L_reported from a three L_year L_evaluation L_study M_covering 152 L_offenders .
alp-fragment01,14,"The L_article M_concludes with an L_affirmation of the L_disciplined but L_non-punitive M_character of L_current L_probation L_work and M_argues that , to L_successfully L_protect the L_public and L_reintegrate L_offenders into the L_community , the L_probation L_officer 's L_employment of L_established L_social L_work L_knowledge , L_skills , and L_values is a M_strength not a M_weakness ."
alp-fragment01,15,"The M_aim of this L_article is to M_challenge the L_assertion M_contained in the L_White L_Paper L_Crime , L_Justice and L_Protecting the L_Public ( L_Home L_Office , 1990a ) that L_probation L_practice can be M_conceived of as a M_form of L_punishment in the L_community ."
alp-fragment01,16,L_Issue will be M_taken with the L_appropriateness of M_applying the L_concept of L_punishment to the L_probation M_context through L_reference to a M_demanding and M_successful L_probation L_project M_concerned with L_offenders in L_trouble through L_drink .
alp-fragment01,17,"In L_describing the L_project , a L_non-punitive M_model for L_understanding L_probation L_practice will be L_developed ."
alp-fragment01,18,"This L_non-punitive L_paradigm will M_provide a M_framework for L_contrasting the L_efficacy of L_current L_practice with L_future M_plans L_inappropriately to M_transform L_probation L_work into ‘ a L_new M_approach to L_punishment in the L_community ’ ( p. 18 , para. 4.3 ) ."
alp-fragment01,19,The L_punitive M_approach L_anticipated for the L_Probation L_Service in the L_White L_Paper is M_underpinned by a L_definition of L_punishment that M_resides ‘ in the L_restrictions on L_liberty and in the L_enforcement of the M_orders ’ .
alp-fragment01,20,"The L_White L_Paper M_goes on to M_emphasize : ‘ It is the M_loss of L_liberty L_involved in L_carrying out the M_terms of the M_order L_rather than the L_activities L_carried out during the M_order which is the L_punishment ’ ( p. 18 , para. 4.4 ) ."
alp-fragment01,21,"Notwithstanding the L_popular L_appeal and L_political M_capital to be L_derived from such a humane-sounding L_statement , this L_definition is L_nevertheless at L_variance with the L_traditional L_understanding of the L_meaning of L_punishment ."
alp-fragment01,22,"L_Discourses on L_punishment and L_dictionary L_definitions of the M_term M_clearly L_specify the M_central M_feature of L_punishment as being the L_infliction of M_pain L_rather than the M_loss of L_liberty per se ( L_Hudson , 1987 ) ."
alp-fragment01,23,The L_conceptual and L_practical L_implications of this L_discrepancy will be L_examined in the L_third and L_final M_section of this L_article .
alp-fragment01,24,"L_Beforehand , L_however , L_consideration will be M_given L_first to the L_probation L_project and L_second to its L_evaluation ."
alp-fragment01,25,In these M_sections L_punishment will be L_understood to L_mean the L_infliction of M_pain and the L_review of the L_project will M_seek to L_demonstrate that the L_probation L_practice L_described is not only more M_demanding but L_also more L_effective than this L_traditional L_understanding of L_punishment .
alp-fragment01,26,"At a L_time when the M_Home L_Secretary is M_inviting the L_Probation L_Service to ‘ M_move M_centre M_stage in the L_Criminal L_Justice M_System ’ ( L_NACRO , 1990 , p. 17 ) it may L_seem L_misguided and L_unnecessarily L_pedantic to M_take L_issue with the L_White L_Paper 's L_notion of L_punishment ."
alp-fragment01,27,L_Punishment is just a L_word after all : L_nothing more than L_convenient L_political L_rhetoric L_meriting only M_lip-service from L_probation L_managers and L_practitioners L_poised at the ‘ M_window of L_opportunity ’ .
alp-fragment01,28,"L_However , this L_fails to L_acknowledge a L_fundamental L_axiom of L_social L_work L_practice ; L_namely that L_language not only M_reflects but L_also M_shapes L_social L_reality ."
alp-fragment01,29,"As L_Davies ( 1981 ) has M_pointed out , L_speech is the L_basic M_tool of the L_social L_worker ."
alp-fragment01,30,"What we L_say L_influences what we L_think and in M_turn , what we do ."
alp-fragment01,31,If L_punishment is M_assimilated into the L_probation L_glossary it will L_inevitably L_influence the L_sort of L_practice the L_Service M_undertakes .
alp-fragment01,32,"In the M_sections to M_follow the M_stark L_question is L_therefore M_put ‘ Is the L_Probation L_Service in the L_business of L_inflicting M_pain ? ’ and the L_answer which M_unfolds may be L_summarized ‘ No , because it L_neither M_aspires nor M_wishes to ! ’"
alp-fragment01,33,THE L_PROJECT : MORE M_DEMANDING THAN L_PUNISHMENT
alp-fragment01,34,L_Government L_concern about the L_problem of L_drink-related L_offending is as L_old as the L_Probation L_Service .
alp-fragment01,35,"L_Indeed , as L_Bochel ( 1976 ) has M_shown , the L_establishment of a L_Probation L_Service in L_England and L_Wales was L_inextricably M_linked with L_work L_undertaken with L_offenders in L_trouble through L_drink ."
alp-fragment01,36,L_Almost a L_century L_later the L_new M_approach to L_punishment in the L_community M_outlined by the L_White L_Paper once again M_presents L_alcohol L_misuse as a L_key L_problem L_requiring L_community-based L_intervention .
alp-fragment01,37,"‘ L_Alcohol ’ , the L_White L_Paper M_states , ‘ is L_implicated in a M_wide L_variety of L_crimes , L_drunken L_driving , L_offences of L_public L_disorder and L_domestic L_violence ’ ( p. 21 , para. 4. 14 ) ."
alp-fragment01,38,In M_describing its M_vision of L_effective L_supervision the L_White L_Paper M_goes on to M_note :
alp-fragment01,39,L_offenders M_take M_part in L_alcohol L_education L_programmes so that they can L_learn to L_drink L_sensibly .
alp-fragment01,40,"They L_learn about the L_relative M_strength of L_different L_drinks , the L_amount which is L_safe to L_consume , and the L_pitfalls to L_avoid ( e.g. L_competitive L_drinking and L_buying ‘ M_rounds ’ ) ( p. 37 , para. 7.11 ) ."
alp-fragment01,41,"As a L_summary of L_alcohol L_education L_programmes , this is L_something of a L_simplification ."
alp-fragment01,42,L_However it does M_provide a L_useful M_introduction to the L_origins of the L_Alcohol L_Education M_Course L_reported here .
alp-fragment01,43,"L_Furthermore , it M_highlights the L_suitability of L_referring to this L_type of L_project for M_testing out the L_appropriateness of M_applying the L_notion of L_punishment to L_probation L_practice ."
alp-fragment01,44,"In 1985 the L_management of L_Somerset L_Probation L_Service was M_faced with the L_fact that L_nearly one in three of the L_offenders L_supervised in their L_area were L_either L_known to be or L_suspected of L_misusing L_alcohol ( L_Singer , 1985 ) ."
alp-fragment01,45,"L_Aware of L_practitioners ' L_frustration in not being L_able to L_work L_effectively with these L_problematic L_clients , L_Probation M_management , in L_partnership with the L_voluntary M_sector , L_determined to L_develop an L_Alcohol L_Education M_Course ( L_AEC ) ."
alp-fragment01,46,"By 1986 , when L_social L_inquiry L_report L_monitoring L_information M_covering 1,257 L_offenders L_indicated that the L_problem of L_drink-related L_offending was L_virtually as L_great for L_pre- as for L_post-sentence L_clients , that is , L_alcohol was L_cited as a L_pre-offence L_problem in L_twenty-nine per L_cent of L_cases , a L_specialist L_project L_worker had been L_appointed ."
alp-fragment01,47,Towards the M_end of 1986 an L_AEC was M_launched and has been M_running L_ever since .
alp-fragment01,48,The M_aim of the M_course is to L_educate L_offenders about L_alcohol to L_facilitate a L_lasting L_change in their L_subsequent L_use of this L_drug .
alp-fragment01,49,"This M_aim is M_underpinned by three L_interrelated L_objectives and it is not without M_significance how they L_complement and M_serve to L_implement the L_White L_Paper 's own L_trinity of ‘ M_aims of L_supervision ’ , that is , L_protection of the L_public , L_prevention of L_reoffending and L_successful L_reintegration of the L_offender in the L_community ( p. 35 , para. 7.3 ) ."
alp-fragment01,50,These were :
alp-fragment01,51,1 .
alp-fragment01,52,To M_increase L_knowledge about L_alcohol so that L_future L_alcohol L_use can be more L_informed and L_therefore more L_prudent .
alp-fragment01,53,2 .
alp-fragment01,54,To L_instil or M_reinforce L_responsible L_drinking M_attitudes and L_behaviour .
alp-fragment01,55,3 .
alp-fragment01,56,"To M_encourage the M_maintenance of , or , where L_appropriate , a L_reduction to a L_personally and L_socially L_safe L_level of L_alcohol L_unit L_intake ."
alp-fragment01,57,"To M_meet these L_objectives the L_AEC has a L_structured L_programme L_involving L_group and L_individual M_contact , that is , six L_group L_sessions M_sandwiched between L_one-to-one L_interviews M_held L_immediately before and after the L_group ."
alp-fragment01,58,"The L_initial L_one-to-one L_meeting , M_held with one of the two L_group L_leaders , M_serves to L_clarify what L_participants can L_expect from the M_course and what is L_expected of them ."
alp-fragment01,59,A M_standard L_contract which M_covers L_conditions of L_attendance and an L_agreement to L_complete L_various L_assignments between L_group L_sessions is L_signed by each L_participant .
alp-fragment01,60,"The L_final L_interview M_entails a L_personalized L_review of the M_course , as L_well as the M_formulation of a L_follow-up M_plan to be L_undertaken with the L_offender 's L_supervising L_officer ."
alp-fragment01,61,"The M_course M_employs a L_variety of M_materials and L_techniques M_including the L_use of L_checklists , L_magazine and L_newspaper L_clippings , L_quizzes , L_videos , L_brainstorm M_exercises , L_discussions , L_drink L_diaries , and L_role L_plays ( L_Menary , 1986 ) ."
alp-fragment01,62,The L_AEC is L_primarily L_intended for L_young L_adults L_subject to a L_probation M_order with a L_special L_condition of L_attendance ( L_Schedule 11 4A(II) L_Criminal L_Justice L_Act 1982 ) and M_reflects the L_fact that most L_Somerset L_offenders in L_trouble through L_drink M_commit M_serious L_offences and/or L_possess a M_substantial L_number of L_previous L_convictions .
alp-fragment01,63,"In L_short , they are L_seriously at L_risk of M_committing further L_offences and L_becoming L_trapped in the M_revolving M_door of L_custody ."
alp-fragment01,64,The L_development of the L_Somerset L_AEC both L_accords with and L_constitutes a L_practical L_example of the L_Home L_Office 's L_recent L_guidance to L_sentencers :
alp-fragment01,65,In L_recent L_years the L_probation L_service has L_devoted L_increasing M_resources to M_supervising the more M_serious and L_persistent L_offenders .
alp-fragment01,66,"L_Probation M_orders which are M_combined with M_constructive , L_disciplined and L_effective L_programmes of L_supervision are L_increasingly being L_used for L_offenders who M_stand to L_receive L_custodial L_sentences ( 1990b , p. 35 ) ."
alp-fragment01,67,From the M_description of the L_AEC L_already M_given the M_demanding and L_disciplined M_nature of the M_course can be L_appreciated .
alp-fragment01,68,"L_However , the M_course is not L_punitive ; it is not M_concerned with the L_infliction of M_pain ."
alp-fragment01,69,"L_Instead , it is M_concerned with the L_establishment of M_rules ."
alp-fragment01,70,This is M_plainly L_evident from the M_section of the L_contract L_signed by each L_participant where what is L_expected of them is M_spelt out :
alp-fragment01,71,"You will be L_expected to L_keep a L_drink L_diary throughout the M_course , and M_make L_attempts at L_reducing the L_amount you L_drink if it is L_greater than L_accepted L_healthy L_drinking L_levels ."
alp-fragment01,72,You must be L_willing to be L_helped and L_help L_others — your L_experiences will be L_useful to other L_group M_members .
alp-fragment01,73,"You must L_attend 8 L_sessions ( these will L_consist of : an L_introductory L_session , six L_group L_sessions and a L_final L_assessment L_interview ) ."
alp-fragment01,74,You must not L_drink before the L_session .
alp-fragment01,75,You must be on L_time — L_lateness will M_count as an L_absence .
alp-fragment01,76,"Unlike the L_prison L_inmate , L_AEC L_participants can not M_sit M_back and L_passively do their L_time ."
alp-fragment01,77,"L_Probation L_practice is not , L_however , L_solely M_concerned with the L_establishment of M_rules ."
alp-fragment01,78,"As has been L_demonstrated L_elsewhere with L_regard to the L_generic L_probation M_setting ( L_Singer , 1989 ) , the L_supervision of L_offenders L_involves two L_overarching M_aims : L_namely M_support and L_surveillance ."
alp-fragment01,79,M_Support L_refers to L_anything which is L_said or done to L_help the L_offender L_solve or L_mitigate their L_personal or L_social L_problems : L_surveillance to L_anything which is L_said or done to L_induce the L_offender to L_conform to L_socially L_acceptable M_standards of L_behaviour .
alp-fragment01,80,These M_aims are L_implemented through the L_practice of four L_distinguishable but L_related L_methods .
alp-fragment01,81,"In L_terms of M_support , there is L_counselling and L_assisting : in L_terms of L_surveillance , there is L_directing and L_monitoring ."
alp-fragment01,82,Each of these four L_methods are M_employed during the eight L_sessions .
alp-fragment01,83,"Although L_summarized as an L_alcohol L_education M_course , the L_sessions are not just M_concerned with M_giving L_information but L_also with L_enabling L_participants to M_make L_practical L_use of it ."
alp-fragment01,84,"In the L_first L_group L_session the L_counselling L_method is L_registered in the M_course L_tutor 's L_notes ( L_Menary , 1986 ) by the L_explanation : ‘ This L_session M_aims to M_get L_participants to L_consider the M_subject of L_alcohol in M_ways they had not L_thought of in the L_past ’ ( p. 3 ) ."
alp-fragment01,85,During this L_session the L_importance of L_monitoring is L_also M_emphasized :
alp-fragment01,86,"L_Drinks M_exercises M_introduce the L_notion of L_measurement , L_concentration of L_alcohol L_content ; L_information which will be L_necessary to L_carry out the L_recording of L_alcohol L_consumption throughout the L_duration of the M_course ( p. 3 ) ."
alp-fragment01,87,"In the L_fifth L_group L_session L_entitled ‘ M_Focus on the L_Individual ’ , the L_counselling and the L_monitoring L_combine with the L_directing and L_assisting L_methods ."
alp-fragment01,88,At the L_start of the L_session the L_tutor 's L_notes M_make M_clear that M_directing M_extends beyond L_enforcing the L_conditions of L_attendance :
alp-fragment01,89,This L_session M_allows for an in L_depth L_examination of the L_drinking L_diaries over the L_last five L_weeks — L_identifying the L_risky L_circumstances or M_situations … .
alp-fragment01,90,The M_aim at the M_end of the L_session is to L_encourage L_participants to M_make L_rules for their L_future L_drinking which will M_lead to a L_lessening of L_identified L_problems ( p. 4 ) .
alp-fragment01,91,"L_Similarly , the L_assisting M_extends beyond L_simply L_providing L_handouts of L_useful L_information :"
alp-fragment01,92,It is L_important that L_participants are L_provided with the L_skills to M_reduce their L_drinking L_levels or M_handle more L_effectively ‘ L_pub L_centred ’ L_problems .
alp-fragment01,93,"The L_use of L_role L_play , L_incorporating L_previously L_discussed L_difficulties ( i.e. L_homework L_assignment L_session 4 ) in ‘ L_real ’ or M_set up M_situations L_provides an L_opportunity for L_testing these L_skills ."
alp-fragment01,94,L_Probably the L_best M_illustration of the L_assisting L_method in L_action during the M_course M_comes in the L_fifth L_session when L_Somerset L_practitioners M_take the L_logic of L_working with the L_problem in the L_community to its L_ultimate L_conclusion .
alp-fragment01,95,"In the L_second M_half of the L_session , M_course L_leaders L_sponsor L_participants to an L_evening at the L_pub for the L_purpose of L_practising L_drinking L_skills and L_purchasing L_non-alcoholic L_drinks ."
alp-fragment01,96,"The L_counselling , L_assisting , L_directing , and L_monitoring on the L_AEC M_give M_substance to the M_aims of M_support and L_surveillance and L_provide the L_basis for L_establishing a M_model of L_probation L_practice ."
alp-fragment01,97,L_Punishment has no M_place in this M_model .
alp-fragment01,98,L_Instead the L_AEC can L_best be L_understood as an L_example of a L_non-punitive L_paradigm of L_probation L_practice .
alp-fragment01,99,"Twenty L_years ago the L_Advisory L_Council on the L_Penal M_System M_observed that L_notions of L_punitiveness do not L_accord with ‘ the L_British L_concept of L_probation as an L_alternative to , L_rather than a M_suspension of , L_punishment ’ ( L_quoted in L_Bochel , 1976 , p. 238 ) ."
alp-fragment01,100,Twenty L_years L_later the L_AEC M_demonstrates that this L_remains no L_less L_true now than it was then .
alp-fragment01,101,But does the L_AEC M_work ?
amm-fragment02,1593,M_BRINGING L_FOSSILS M_BACK TO M_LIFE
amm-fragment02,1594,"In this L_chapter some of the M_ways in which L_palaeontologists L_determine the M_way L_fossil L_animals L_lived are L_described , M_reanimating the L_dead L_fragments to M_build up a M_living M_creature ."
amm-fragment02,1595,"Since L_popular L_ideas of L_life in the L_past are L_often M_founded on M_vividly M_coloured M_reconstructions of ‘ The L_World in the L_Jurassic L_Period ’ and the L_like , it is L_important to L_remember that these L_imaginative M_scenes are all L_inferences from L_bones , and L_similar L_fragments ."
amm-fragment02,1596,"In L_fact there is L_nothing M_fixed about such L_interpretations , because the M_way the L_fossils are L_understood may M_change over the L_years , but it is L_usually some L_time before L_new L_discoveries M_percolate into the L_popular L_presentations ."
amm-fragment02,1597,L_Even the most L_solid-looking L_dinosaurs may have M_changed their M_habits in the L_last few L_years !
amm-fragment02,1598,L_Many L_different M_lines of L_evidence may be L_used to L_flesh out the L_bare L_bones of the L_fossils .
amm-fragment02,1599,The L_first of these is the L_evidence of the L_rocks from which the L_remains were L_recovered .
amm-fragment02,1600,"The L_sediments themselves M_reveal L_much about the L_environment of L_deposition , as was M_shown in L_Chapter 3 ."
amm-fragment02,1601,"It is L_important to L_establish whether the L_fossil L_animal L_actually L_lived in the L_environment which M_furnished its L_sedimentary L_cover , or whether its L_remains were M_swept in from some other L_place ."
amm-fragment02,1602,L_Fortunately it is L_usually L_easy to L_spot such M_intruders .
amm-fragment02,1603,"The L_type of L_sediment and the L_associated L_fossils will M_show whether the L_environment was L_marine , L_freshwater or L_terrestrial , L_providing the L_basic L_information into which the L_ecology of the L_animal has to be M_accommodated ."
amm-fragment02,1604,The L_sediments themselves may have M_preserved some of the L_tracks L_left by the L_animal ( p. 20 ) to M_give M_direct L_evidence of its L_past M_activities .
amm-fragment02,1605,"From the L_tracks L_alone it is L_possible to be L_certain of the L_bipedal M_stance of L_certain L_dinosaurs , and to L_measure their M_stride ."
amm-fragment02,1606,"The M_character of the L_rocks , and their L_setting in the L_past L_geography at the L_time when they L_accumulated , M_diagnoses the L_climatic L_setting in which the L_extinct L_fauna L_lived , and L_climate M_imposes L_certain M_restraints on L_possible L_modes of L_life ."
amm-fragment02,1607,"L_Savannah L_animals L_differ from those of L_tropical L_rain L_forests , and these again from M_inhabitants of the L_tundra at M_high L_latitudes ."
amm-fragment02,1608,"L_Looking at the L_fossil L_animal itself , the L_first L_necessity is to L_reconstruct it as L_accurately as L_possible from its L_fragmentary L_remains ."
amm-fragment02,1609,"L_Sometimes this is a very L_complex L_business , L_particularly for L_vertebrates with L_numbers of L_small L_bones ."
amm-fragment02,1610,To M_proceed from the M_reconstruction to an M_assessment of L_probable L_life M_habits two L_different but L_complementary M_approaches are L_used .
amm-fragment02,1611,One L_method M_attempts to L_compare the L_structures of L_teeth or L_limbs or some other L_feature of the L_extinct L_animal with L_living L_analogues .
amm-fragment02,1612,These do not have to be L_biologically M_related L_organisms .
amm-fragment02,1613,The L_basic L_argument is that L_structures that are M_closely L_similar were L_probably L_adapted to a L_similar L_function .
amm-fragment02,1614,"L_Sometimes these L_similarities are L_quite L_obvious : the M_ferocious L_teeth of a L_predatory L_dinosaur are a L_sure L_indication of L_hunting M_habits , with L_hardly a L_glance at the L_fangs of L_living L_mammalian L_carnivores ."
amm-fragment02,1615,"But the L_structure and L_functioning of L_grinding or L_chewing L_teeth in other L_mammals , in which M_opposing L_teeth M_co-operate in L_action , and which can be L_matched in L_extinct , M_unrelated L_mammals , is a L_much more L_subtle L_matter , L_involving L_detailed L_studies on the L_operation of L_living L_dental L_systems to L_help L_elucidate the L_functioning of L_fossil L_ones ."
amm-fragment02,1616,"The L_technique of ‘ M_hunt the L_analogue ’ is a L_favourite one L_practised by L_palaeontologists , but it is L_certainly not a L_foolproof one , because there are L_many L_fossil L_animals that M_defy L_comparison with L_living L_organisms , and some L_analogues do not M_stand up to L_detailed L_scrutiny ."
amm-fragment02,1617,The L_second L_method M_tries to L_analyse the L_structure of the L_fossil L_almost as if it were a M_piece of M_engineering .
amm-fragment02,1618,"If the L_fossil is L_constructed in a L_certain M_way , then there are only a L_limited L_number of ‘ M_jobs ’ that the L_structure could M_perform ."
amm-fragment02,1619,The L_idea here is to L_decide which of the L_possibilities is the most L_likely one .
amm-fragment02,1620,This M_assumes that L_nature only M_manufactures L_efficient M_designs .
amm-fragment02,1621,For the most L_part this is a L_reasonable L_assumption to M_make .
amm-fragment02,1622,"Most L_animals M_today do L_seem to have L_bodies that M_accord L_well with the L_functions they have to L_carry out to L_survive : M_flyers are L_aerodynamically L_efficient , L_active M_swimmers have L_suitable L_streamlining , L_herbivorous L_mammals have L_teeth L_appropriate for L_grinding L_plant L_food , and so on ."
amm-fragment02,1623,"L_Ideally one could L_construct a L_model of the L_fossil to L_test out these L_various L_functions in L_experiments , but the L_number of L_examples where the L_analysis has been M_pursued this M_far are L_limited ."
amm-fragment02,1624,Of L_course it can L_never be L_known whether the L_right M_answer has been M_reached ( unless L_somebody L_dredges up a ‘ L_living L_fossil ’ from the L_depths of the L_ocean ) — there are only L_varying L_degrees of L_probability .
amm-fragment02,1625,"But the L_best M_answers are L_probably M_obtained where the L_functional M_design of the L_fossil M_points to the same L_life M_habits as a L_living L_analogue , and where both are M_consistent with the L_geological L_circumstances in which the L_fossil L_remains L_occur ."
amm-fragment02,1626,L_SWIMMING L_TRILOBITES
amm-fragment02,1627,There are L_thousands of L_different L_kinds of L_trilobites .
amm-fragment02,1628,All of them were L_marine and all of them are L_extinct .
amm-fragment02,1629,"Since L_many L_kinds of L_trilobites L_co-existed at any one L_time they were L_probably M_occupying L_different L_ecological M_niches , L_behaving in L_different M_ways , L_corresponding with the M_wide L_variation in L_shape that they M_show ."
amm-fragment02,1630,"We can L_use the L_methods L_described above to L_elucidate some of these M_occupations , and M_get a M_glimpse , albeit an L_imperfect one , of the L_trilobite as it L_lived ."
amm-fragment02,1631,"I will M_take an L_example where all the L_methods can be L_used , and where all M_point in the same M_direction , so that the M_answer is L_probably L_correct ."
amm-fragment02,1632,"Most L_trilobites were L_broadly L_oval-shaped being L_rather L_longer than L_wide , not L_greatly L_convex , and with L_eyes that M_occupy L_perhaps a L_quarter of the L_length of the L_head ."
amm-fragment02,1633,"There are a few L_trilobite L_species , L_however , with L_enormous , L_globular L_eyes ( L_see below ) ."
amm-fragment02,1634,By L_examining the M_way these L_animals were M_put M_together it is L_possible to L_suggest a L_likely M_mode of L_life .
amm-fragment02,1635,"L_Giant-eyed L_Ordovician L_trilobite , L_seen from the L_top and L_side ."
amm-fragment02,1636,L_Twice its L_natural L_size .
amm-fragment02,1637,L_Enlargement M_shows a L_section through the L_lenses to M_show the L_direction of the M_field of L_view .
amm-fragment02,1638,We can M_take the L_eyes L_first .
amm-fragment02,1639,"The L_trilobite L_eye was of a L_compound L_type , and each L_lens was M_made up of a L_calcite L_crystal ."
amm-fragment02,1640,From the L_optical L_properties of this L_mineral we L_know that the L_lens was M_able to M_interpret L_light M_coming from a L_direction more or L_less at L_right-angles to the L_lens L_surface .
amm-fragment02,1641,"So we can L_deduce what the M_field of L_vision of our L_globular-eyed L_trilobite was , by L_looking at the L_directions in which all the L_lenses L_face ."
amm-fragment02,1642,"It M_turns out that our L_animal was M_able to L_see in L_almost every L_direction — L_upwards , L_downwards , L_sideways and L_forwards , and L_even L_backwards , because the L_eyes L_bulged out beyond the M_line of the L_rest of the L_body ."
amm-fragment02,1643,Most other L_trilobites have a L_predominantly L_lateral M_field of L_view .
amm-fragment02,1644,"If the L_animal L_lived on the L_sea L_bottom , it L_seems L_unlikely that it would have L_eye L_lenses L_specialized for L_looking L_downwards , and we L_begin to M_suspect that the L_animal M_habitually L_dwelt above the L_sea L_floor ."
amm-fragment02,1645,Other L_features of its L_shape are M_consistent with this .
amm-fragment02,1646,"At the– L_edge of the L_eyes are a L_pair of L_long L_spines , and these M_point L_downwards at a L_steep L_angle , at very L_awkward L_attitude for L_resting L_comfortably on the L_sea L_floor ."
amm-fragment02,1647,"Most ‘ L_normal ’ L_trilobites have a more or L_less L_horizontal L_rim around the L_forward L_margin , which may have L_rested on the L_sediment L_surface ."
amm-fragment02,1648,The L_thorax of the L_large-eyed L_trilobite is L_remarkably L_long L_compared with the L_average L_trilobite ( L_compare Fig. 33 ) .
amm-fragment02,1649,"The L_convex , L_middle L_part of the L_thorax L_contained the L_musculature that M_operated the L_appendages ( which , as L_usual , are not L_preserved ) , and the L_relatively L_large L_volume of this L_region M_shows that the L_musculature was L_powerful ."
amm-fragment02,1650,"The L_construction of this L_giant-eyed L_trilobite M_suggests that it L_lived an L_actively L_swimming L_life L_well above the L_bottom , and L_possibly in the L_surface L_waters of the L_sea ."
amm-fragment02,1651,"Of L_course because there are no L_living L_trilobites we can not M_find M_direct L_confirmation of this L_hypothesis , but we can M_look for other L_arthropods that have the same M_modifications of the L_eyes , for L_example , in the L_present L_day L_oceans ."
amm-fragment02,1652,"The L_analogy is M_found in such L_ocean-going L_amphipods ( a L_kind of ‘ L_shrimp ’ ) as L_Cystosoma , which L_also has L_enormously L_expanded L_eyes , L_looking like M_headlamps , L_compared with its L_bottom-dwelling M_relatives ( L_see above ) ."

amm-fragment02,1749,"L_Active M_swimmers in the L_surface L_waters of the M_present L_oceans are L_likely to L_feed L_directly on the L_plankton , and the L_trilobites may have had a L_method of M_harvesting M_large L_quantities of L_minute L_food ."

amm-fragment02,1752,L_CONTROVERSY AMONG THE L_GIANT L_DINOSAURS
amm-fragment02,1753,The L_giant L_sauropod L_dinosaurs like L_Brachiosaurus were the L_largest L_land L_animals the L_world has M_seen they L_weighed more than 80 L_tonnes and M_present L_quite L_different L_problems in the L_interpretation of their L_life M_habits from the L_diminutive L_trilobites .
amm-fragment02,1754,"Such L_spectacular L_animals have L_obviously M_attracted L_much L_attention , and one L_might L_suppose that the L_problem of how they L_lived would have been L_satisfactorily L_solved L_long L_ago ."
amm-fragment02,1755,"Most of the L_popular L_books M_showing the L_Mesozoic M_giants in their L_natural L_setting L_portray them L_wallowing about in L_swamps L_flanked by L_deep L_vegetation , their L_bodies L_largely under L_water ."
amm-fragment02,1756,"L_Surely an L_animal of this L_bulk , it was L_argued , must be L_partly L_supported by L_water , and their L_relatively L_inconsequential L_teeth must have been L_adapted for L_chewing on the L_kind of L_soft , L_luxuriant L_vegetation that L_flourishes in and around L_swamps ."
amm-fragment02,1757,Because their L_nasal L_openings were on the L_top of their L_heads they could L_even L_continue to L_breathe if it L_became L_necessary ( L_see p. 115 ) to L_totally L_submerge .
amm-fragment02,1758,L_Recently the L_life M_habits of the M_giants have been M_looked at in a M_way that M_disproves most of these L_traditional L_notions .
amm-fragment02,1759,L_Consider the M_structure of their L_legs .
amm-fragment02,1760,"The L_sauropods have L_relatively L_long , M_pillar-like L_legs , L_resembling those of the L_elephant , the L_largest L_living L_land L_animal , and may have been L_well L_adapted for L_supporting the L_huge L_bulk of the L_animal ."
amm-fragment02,1761,"The L_feet of the L_sauropod are L_small ( L_relatively M_speaking ! ) , with L_short , L_stubby L_toes , yet L_animals that L_walk on L_soft L_mud M_tend to have L_spreading L_feet to L_distribute their L_weight more L_evenly ."
amm-fragment02,1762,"It is L_difficult to M_see how the L_compact L_feet of the L_sauropod could M_avoid L_becoming L_stuck L_fast in the L_soft , L_muddy L_bottom of a L_lake ."
amm-fragment02,1763,"If the L_dinosaur did , after all , L_live on L_dry L_land , then the L_long L_neck could have L_usefully L_functioned to M_allow the L_animal to L_browse the L_high L_foliage of L_trees ( L_see p. 116 ) ."
amm-fragment02,1764,It has been L_suggested that an L_animal of the L_size of L_Brachiosaurus could not have L_breathed under L_water because of the L_pressure on the L_lungs .
amm-fragment02,1765,"Their L_fossil L_remains L_seem to L_occur with other L_animals and L_plants , which are L_generally L_accepted as L_terrestrial ."
amm-fragment02,1766,There is L_even some L_evidence from the L_tracks they have L_left behind that L_Diplodocus and its M_allies L_moved about in L_herds .
amm-fragment02,1767,"They may have been the L_gigantic L_reptilian L_analogue of the L_elephant , and it may be no L_coincidence that the L_elephant L_also has its L_nasal L_openings on L_top of the L_skull , with the L_nostrils in this L_case M_sited at the L_end of the L_trunk it has been L_suggested that some L_sauropods may have had a L_proboscis of some L_sort ."
amm-fragment02,1768,The M_balance of L_evidence L_seems to be M_swinging M_away from the L_original L_idea of L_swamp-dwelling L_giant L_dinosaurs to L_fully L_terrestrial M_habits .
amm-fragment02,1769,But other M_aspects of the L_dinosaur L_living M_habits are L_still more M_strongly L_debated .
amm-fragment02,1770,"In the L_last few L_years a M_powerful L_controversy has M_arisen over whether the L_dinosaurs as a L_whole were L_cold-blooded , like all L_living L_reptiles ( and there is no L_doubt that L_dinosaurs were L_reptiles ) , or L_warm-blooded , L_resembling L_mammals in this L_respect ."
amm-fragment02,1771,L_Cold-blooded L_animals have to ‘ M_warm up ’ before they can be L_fully L_active ; that is why L_lizards and L_snakes L_bask in the L_sun in L_temperate M_climates .
amm-fragment02,1772,For this L_reason they can not M_cope with L_climates having L_greatly M_extended L_winters .
amm-fragment02,1773,"L_Warm-blooded L_animals have the same L_body L_temperatures at all L_times , and can be more M_continuously L_active , but they M_use M_far more L_energy — and L_hence L_need more L_food — than L_cold-blooded L_animals of the same L_size ."
amm-fragment02,1774,"The M_posture of L_many L_dinosaurs , and L_particularly the L_carnivorous L_theropod L_dinosaurs , was L_fully L_erect with the L_legs beneath the L_body , and unlike the L_sprawling L_legs of L_living L_reptiles ( L_see p. 116 ) ."
amm-fragment02,1775,"The L_long L_back L_legs of such M_hunters L_look L_highly L_suitable for L_running , and as they did so the L_long L_tail may have been L_held L_erect as a L_kind of L_counter-balance ( L_see p. 116 ) ."
amm-fragment02,1776,"For any L_kind of L_prolonged L_activity , L_warm-bloodedness would have been a L_distinct L_advantage ."
amm-fragment02,1777,Under the L_microscope L_even the L_bone M_structure of these L_dinosaurs L_looks more like that of L_living L_mammals than L_cold-blooded L_reptiles .
amm-fragment02,1778,"On the other M_hand it can be L_argued that the L_sauropods like L_Brachiosaurus were so L_large , and with a L_relatively L_small L_surface L_area through which to L_cool L_compared with their L_enormous L_volume , that their L_cooling L_rate could have been L_slow L_enough to M_allow them to L_sustain more M_continuous L_activity than L_smaller , L_living L_reptiles ."
amm-fragment02,1779,"It has L_also been L_argued that the L_small L_mouths of the M_giants L_simply could not have downed L_enough L_food to M_support a L_warm-blooded L_metabolism , L_particularly L_plant L_food that L_needs a L_lot of L_processing before it L_becomes L_available as L_energy ."
amm-fragment02,1780,"The M_armoured or M_plated L_dinosaurs L_include some L_species that L_seem too L_heavily L_burdened with L_protective M_armour to have been very L_active , but this does not L_necessarily L_mean that they had to be L_cold-blooded ."
amm-fragment02,1781,M_Protagonists of the L_warm-blooded L_theory will L_show some of the L_horned L_dinosaurs L_charging over the L_Cretaceous L_plains like M_furious M_reptilian M_rhinoceroses !
amm-fragment02,1782,"One L_idea about the L_life M_habits of the L_dinosaur M_giants , L_published in L_Joc and L_Colette at the L_Natural L_History L_Museum in 1935"
amm-fragment02,1783,The M_warm-blooded L_supporters M_tend to L_ally themselves with the L_supporters of a L_theory about the L_relationships of the L_dinosaurs .
amm-fragment02,1784,"This is that the L_dinosaurs , or a M_close L_dinosaur L_relative , L_included the L_ancestors of the L_living L_birds ."
amm-fragment02,1785,"Some of the L_smaller , and most L_certainly L_highly L_active L_dinosaurs were about the L_size of a L_chicken , and there is more than a M_passing L_similarity between a L_running L_ostrich and the L_kind of M_reconstruction that M_shows L_fleet-footed , L_running L_dinosaurs ."
amm-fragment02,1786,"The M_point is that L_birds themselves are L_warm-blooded , like L_mammals , and if L_birds and L_dinosaurs are as M_closely L_related as now L_seems L_likely , then it L_obviously L_increases the L_likelihood that the L_dinosaurs themselves may have been L_warm-blooded ."
amm-fragment02,1787,"The M_pros and M_cons of this L_theory are the M_subject of L_much L_contentious L_debate by L_experts , but it would L_probably be L_correct to M_say that the M_greater L_number of L_specialists L_believe that at L_least the more L_bipedal of the L_dinosaurs , L_including L_small and L_large L_carnivores , were L_warm-blooded , L_active L_animals ."
amm-fragment02,1788,A M_lot of the L_argument among the L_authorities on these L_animals is about the L_equivalence or L_otherwise of L_certain L_bones in L_dinosaurs and L_bird L_skeletons ( and L_particularly the L_Jurassic L_bird L_Archaeopteryx ) ; this M_makes for L_rather M_dry L_reading for the M_layman .
amm-fragment02,1789,"But the M_end-product is the M_accurate M_reconstruction of the L_Jurassic and L_Cretaceous L_terrestrial M_world , over which the L_dinosaurs were L_indisputably L_dominant ."

as6-fragment01,74,"Despite the L_contemporary M_tone of L_much of L_Action for L_Cities , the L_programme 's L_heritage can be M_traced to the L_early 1960s L_studies which L_provided the L_basis for the 1965 Milner–Holland L_Report on L_housing and the 1967 L_Plowden L_Report on L_education , as a L_result of which L_general L_improvement L_areas and L_education L_priority L_areas were L_established ."

as6-fragment01,80,"L_Earlier , the L_change of M_emphasis from a ‘ L_social ’ to an ‘ L_economic and L_environmental ’ M_focus had been M_reflected in a M_switch of L_responsibility for the L_Programme from the L_Home L_Office to the L_Department of the L_Environment ."

as6-fragment01,83,A L_key M_aspect of the 1977 L_White L_Paper was the M_stress it M_placed on the M_wider L_effects of L_poverty : that it was not just those with L_acute L_needs who L_suffered .
as6-fragment01,84,"It M_argued that in L_talking about L_inner L_cities it was M_vital to L_think in L_terms not just of L_individuals , but of L_society ; that the L_multiple L_deprivations of the L_worst M_hit L_areas L_affected all the L_residents ; that the L_consequences L_included a L_pervasive M_sense of L_neglect and M_decay , a L_decline in L_community M_spirit , a M_low M_standard of L_neighbourhood L_facilities , and an L_increase in L_crime and L_vandalism ; and that , without L_government L_intervention , the L_future was one of M_reduced L_job L_opportunities , L_deteriorating L_housing , and a L_decline in L_public L_services ."

as6-fragment01,88,"L_Neither , at L_first , did the M_incoming L_administration M_foresee the M_impact of M_rising L_unemployment , which was to be L_especially M_serious among the L_urban L_young ."

as6-fragment01,90,"The L_previous L_Government , L_however , had L_already M_pointed to the L_need to M_revitalize L_urban L_economies , and at L_first the L_shift was more L_rhetorical than L_real ."

as6-fragment01,95,"He L_claims that M_serious L_work on L_inner-city L_policy L_began in 1979 : but it was , L_undoubtedly , the L_riots of 1981 , L_coinciding with the M_biggest M_drop in L_employment and L_job L_vacancies since the L_war , which M_gave M_impetus to the M_new M_approach ."
as6-fragment01,96,"L_Urban L_Development L_Corporations were L_introduced in 1981 in L_London L_Docklands and L_Merseyside , and the L_Urban L_Development L_Grant M_came in L_late the M_following L_year ."

as6-fragment01,99,The L_increased M_scale of M_operations L_also M_ushered in another L_fashion of the 1980s — M_new L_management M_structures .
as6-fragment01,100,L_Thus in 1985 L_City L_Action> L_Teams were L_introduced to each ‘ L_Inner L_City L_Partnership ’ L_area to M_co-ordinate the L_work of the three L_government L_departments L_involved .

as6-fragment01,102,"By 1986/7 the L_Urban L_Programme was M_supporting 1,380 L_starter L_units and 400 L_business L_starts in L_enterprise M_workshops ."
as6-fragment01,103,"It was L_providing 27,500 M_training M_places ( L_often in L_conjunction with the L_Manpower L_Services L_Commission ) : some 2,500 L_buildings were being L_improved ; L_estate L_action M_aimed to M_tackle L_run down L_housing ; and a M_large L_number of M_new ‘ L_partnerships ’ ( which some might M_see as L_subsidies , or M_discredited L_regional L_grants , in a M_new L_guise ) were in M_operation , in an L_effort to M_bring L_private L_investment to L_run-down L_urban L_areas ."
as6-fragment01,104,By 1988 it was L_claimed that £200 million of L_Urban L_Development L_Grant and L_Urban M_Regeneration L_Grant had L_successfully ‘ M_levered ’ more than £800 million of L_private L_investment into the L_inner L_cities ( although how L_much of the L_latter L_sum might have been L_invested in any L_case is L_difficult to M_say ) .
as6-fragment01,105,"L_Meanwhile , there were other L_incentive L_schemes — L_Enterprise L_Zones , for L_example , and L_simplified L_Planning L_Zones , which M_aimed to M_lift L_tax and L_planning ‘ M_barriers ’ in L_order to L_facilitate L_investment ."
as6-fragment01,106,"L_Indeed , while with one M_hand L_trying to M_hold down L_expenditure by L_local L_authorities , the L_Government M_found itself by the L_late 1980s L_involved with the other M_hand in M_massive L_ear-marked L_spending on L_inner L_urban L_areas ."
as6-fragment01,107,"The L_Department of the L_Environment L_alone by 1988 was M_spending half a billion L_pounds out of an L_Action for L_Cities L_total , L_involving most M_Home L_departments , L_estimated at £3 billion ."
as6-fragment01,108,L_Perhaps a L_Labour L_government would have M_spent L_even more : it would L_certainly have M_spent it in L_different M_ways .
as6-fragment01,109,"It is a M_curious L_comment on L_Thatcherism , L_however , that the L_administration most M_committed to a M_reduction in the M_role of the L_state , and in the L_need for an M_independent L_private M_sector , has M_spent more on L_specific L_urban M_regeneration and L_employment L_schemes and L_incentives to L_private L_investment in L_urban L_areas than any other in L_recent L_history ."
as6-fragment01,110,"One of the most L_bizarre M_aspects of L_government L_policy has been the L_effective M_murder of the L_voluntary M_sector , and its M_appropriation , by L_subterfuge , into the L_Tory M_version of the L_corporate L_state ."
as6-fragment01,111,"L_Conservatives have L_always L_lauded the ‘ L_voluntarist ’ L_principle in L_welfare , and M_encouraged it from M_platforms ."
as6-fragment01,112,"M_Faced , L_however , with the M_catastrophic L_increase in L_unemployment and the L_need to M_occupy M_large L_numbers of L_workless L_people without M_directly L_employing them ( which would have M_run M_counter to the L_economic L_doctrine which had M_led to the L_redundancy of L_many of them in the L_first M_place ) , the L_Government M_poured L_money into any ‘ L_voluntary ’ L_agency M_willing to M_put in a L_bid for L_government-funded L_cheap L_labour ."
as6-fragment01,113,"One L_result was the M_triumphant M_expansion of some M_charitable L_organizations , which M_rejoiced both at their L_new-found L_importance and at the L_Government 's L_munificence ."
as6-fragment01,114,"Another was the L_transformation of L_many such M_bodies , L_already M_heavily L_subsidized from L_public L_funds , into de facto L_agencies of the L_state , which M_financed them and L_indirectly M_determined their L_policy ."
as6-fragment01,115,"L_Nowhere was the M_impact of this M_clumsy M_sleight of M_hand more L_evident than in the L_inner L_cities , where L_voluntary L_organizations had been most L_active , and where the L_Government was most M_anxious for them to M_mop up L_unemployment ."
as6-fragment01,116,"L_However , the L_later M_withdrawal of L_government M_support , with the M_scrapping of the L_Community L_Programme as L_unemployment M_receded , M_left L_many of these L_voluntary L_organizations M_high and M_dry ."
as6-fragment01,117,"The L_National L_Council for L_Voluntary L_Organizations ( L_NCVO ) has M_suggested from a L_recent M_survey that around 3,000 L_projects had been L_affected and had M_lost £285 million in L_funding ( L_MacGregor , 1990 ) ."
as6-fragment01,118,"There was , of L_course , a L_crucial M_element in the L_Government 's M_anxiety : the M_high L_concentration of L_ethnic L_minorities in the L_areas of L_concern ."
as6-fragment01,119,In 1981 L_nearly 40 per L_cent of L_ethnic L_minorities in the L_UK L_lived in ‘ L_partnership ’ or ‘ L_programme ’ L_areas .
as6-fragment01,120,"There is a M_danger in L_reading M_back from this L_figure another L_stereotype , L_similar to the L_Pavlovian ‘ L_drug addiction/inner L_city ’ M_assumed M_link ."
as6-fragment01,121,"Some L_urban L_areas have M_serious L_problems without a L_major L_ethnic M_dimension ( L_Newcastle , L_Teesside ) ; not all M_members of L_ethnic L_minorities are L_poor or L_deprived ."
as6-fragment01,122,"L_Nevertheless , the L_high L_proportion of L_inner L_urban L_populations L_composed of L_people from L_ethnic L_minorities , and the L_high L_incidence among these L_groups of all the L_indices of L_poverty and L_social and L_environmental L_hardship — L_combined with the L_specific L_problem of L_inter-racial L_rivalry , L_harassment , and L_tension — L_make L_race and L_ethnicity an L_aspect that is L_central to any L_analysis of the L_inner L_cities and of any L_ameliorative L_approach ."
as6-fragment02,349,MAKING M_SENSE OF THE 1981 L_RIOTS
as6-fragment02,350,M_Reactions to the L_riots have M_concentrated on a M_number of L_key L_variables that are L_said to L_characterize the L_localities in which the L_riots have L_occurred .
as6-fragment02,351,"L_Lord L_Scarman 's L_report on the 1981 M_disorders M_highlighted the L_importance of L_unemployment , L_urban L_deprivation , L_racial L_disadvantage , L_relations between L_young L_blacks and the L_police , the L_decline of L_civic L_consent , and L_political L_exclusion as the L_key L_issues ."
as6-fragment02,352,Other M_reactions have M_concentrated on the L_issue of the M_interplay between L_inner-city M_decay and L_racial L_disadvantage in L_contemporary L_Britain .
as6-fragment02,353,"L_Yet L_others have L_argued that the L_unrest can be M_seen as a M_symptom of the M_breakdown of L_law and M_order in L_British L_society ( L_Gaffney , 1987 ; L_Hall , 1987 ; L_Keith , 1987 ) ."
as6-fragment02,354,The L_main L_issues that were M_prominent in L_debates during 1980–1 were ‘ L_race ’ and ‘ L_law and M_order ’ .
as6-fragment02,355,"This was by no L_means an L_accident , since throughout the 1970s a M_powerful M_body of L_media , L_political , and L_academic L_opinion had been M_constructed around the L_theme of how L_Britain was M_drifting into a ‘ L_violent L_society ’ , and how the L_basis of L_consent was being M_shifted by the M_pressures of L_immigration and the M_growth of L_multi-racial L_inner L_city L_areas ."
as6-fragment02,356,A M_glimpse of the M_impact of the 1980–1 L_riots at this M_level can be L_achieved through two L_important L_debates in L_Parliament .
as6-fragment02,357,"The L_first M_took M_place in the M_midst of the L_July 1981 L_riots , and had as its L_theme : ‘ L_Civil L_Disturbances ’ ."
as6-fragment02,358,"The M_tone of the L_debate was M_set by L_Home L_Secretary L_William L_Whitelaw 's L_introductory L_statement in which he L_spoke of ( a ) the L_need to ‘ M_remove the M_scourge of L_criminal L_violence from our L_streets ’ , and ( b ) the L_urgency of L_developing ‘ L_policies M_designed to M_promote the L_mutual L_tolerance and L_understanding upon which the M_whole L_future of a L_free L_democratic L_society L_depends ’ ( L_Hansard , vol. 8 , 16 L_July 1981 : col. 1405 ) ."
as6-fragment02,359,"The ‘ M_scourge of L_criminal L_violence ’ was , L_Whitelaw L_argued , a L_danger to the M_whole M_framework of L_consent and L_legality on which the L_political L_institutions of L_British L_society were M_based ."
as6-fragment02,360,"In L_reply L_Roy L_Hattersley M_supported the M_call for the L_immediate M_suppression of L_street L_violence , but L_warned that the M_roots of such L_riots could not be L_dealt with until all L_people M_felt they had a M_stake in L_British L_society ( ibid. : cols. 1407–9 )"
as6-fragment02,361,"The L_second L_debate M_took M_place on 26 L_November 1981 , on the L_publication of the L_Scarman L_Report , and had as its L_theme : ‘ L_Law and M_Order ’ ."
as6-fragment02,362,"The L_importance of the L_riots in M_pushing the L_law and M_order L_issue , and L_specifically L_policing , on to the L_main L_political L_agenda was M_emphasized by the L_Liberal L_leader , L_David L_Steel , who L_argued that ‘ L_urgent L_action ’ to L_prevent a M_drift into L_lawlessness was L_necessary from both a L_moral and a L_political M_perspective ( L_Hansard , vol. 13 , 26 L_November 1981 : cols. 1009–11 ) ."
as6-fragment02,363,"A L_subsequent L_debate on the same L_issue in L_March 1982 was L_also M_full of L_references to the L_experience of 1981 , the M_impact of L_street L_violence , L_crime , M_decaying L_urban L_conditions , the M_breakdown of L_consent between the L_police and L_many L_local L_communities , and the M_spectre of ‘ more L_violence to L_come ’ if L_changes in both L_policing M_tactics and L_social L_policy were not M_swiftly L_introduced ( L_Hansard , vol. 20 , 25 L_March 1982 : cols. 1107–81 ) ."
as6-fragment02,364,"The L_need to M_support the L_police was L_accepted by both the L_Labour and the L_Conservative L_speakers in the L_parliamentary L_debate on the L_riots , and was L_established as a L_benchmark for the L_official M_response to the L_riots M_long before the L_Scarman L_Report was L_published in L_November 1981 ."
as6-fragment02,365,Any L_substantive L_disagreement M_centred around the L_issue of what M_role L_social L_deprivation and L_unemployment had in M_bringing L_young L_people to L_protest L_violently on the L_streets .
as6-fragment02,366,"L_Intermingled with the L_discourses about L_race and L_law and M_order were M_constant L_references to L_unemployment , L_particularly among the L_young , and L_various M_forms of L_social L_disadvantage and L_poverty ( L_Solomos , 1988 , pp. 186–911 ) ."
as6-fragment02,367,"Throughout 1980 and 1981 L_debates about the L_riots in the L_media , in L_Parliament , and in L_various L_official L_reports M_hinged around the L_interrelationship between L_racial , L_law-and-order , and L_social M_factors ."
as6-fragment02,368,"The L_importance of this L_debate can be L_explained , L_partly , by the L_political M_capital which the L_Opposition could M_make from M_linking the L_social and L_economic M_malaise of the L_country at L_large with L_violent L_street L_disturbances ."
as6-fragment02,369,"L_Conversely , throughout this L_period L_Government L_Ministers L_strenuously L_denied that L_unemployment and L_social L_deprivation were L_significant L_causes of L_urban L_unrest ."
as6-fragment02,370,"Although the L_Scarman L_Report is L_often M_taken to be the M_central L_text which M_argues for a M_link between ‘ L_social L_conditions ’ and ‘ M_disorder ’ , the L_terms of the L_debate were by no L_means M_set by L_Scarman ."
as6-fragment02,371,During both L_April and L_July 1981 M_vigorous M_exchanges M_took M_place in the L_press and in L_Parliament about the M_role that L_deteriorating L_social L_conditions and L_unemployment may have M_played in L_bringing about the L_riots .
as6-fragment02,372,"During the 16 L_July L_parliamentary L_debate on ‘ L_Civil L_Disturbances ’ , L_Roy L_Hattersley 's M_formulation of this M_linkage L_provided a L_useful L_summary of the ‘ L_social L_conditions ’ L_argument ."
as6-fragment02,373,"After some L_preliminary L_remarks about the L_Labour L_party 's M_support for the L_police , he L_went on to M_outline his L_opposition to the M_view of the L_riots as L_essentially L_anti-police L_outbursts :"
as6-fragment02,374,I L_repeat that l do not L_believe that the L_principal L_cause of L_last L_week 's L_riots was the L_conduct of the L_police .
as6-fragment02,375,"It was the L_conditions of L_deprivation and L_despair in the M_decaying L_areas of our L_old L_cities — L_areas in which the L_Brixton and L_Toxteth L_riots M_took M_place , and L_areas from which the L_skinhead M_invaders of L_Southall L_come ."
as6-fragment02,376,"( L_Hansard , vol. 8 , 16 L_July 1981 : col. 1408 )"
as6-fragment02,377,L_Much of the L_subsequent L_controversy about this L_analysis M_centred on the L_question of L_youth L_unemployment .
as6-fragment02,378,"L_Hattersley had L_suggested that the L_riots were a ‘ M_direct M_product ’ of L_high M_levels of L_youth L_unemployment , and a L_furious L_debate L_ensued in both L_Parliament and the L_media about this L_assertion ."
as6-fragment02,379,"The L_final L_symbolic M_cue L_used to M_make M_sense of the 1980–1 L_protests is more L_difficult to L_categorize , but its L_basic L_meaning can be M_captured by the L_term ‘ L_political L_marginality ’ ."
as6-fragment02,380,"While a M_number of L_discussions of the M_roots of L_urban L_unrest in the L_United L_States have M_noted the L_salience of L_political L_marginality in L_determining L_participation in L_violent L_protests ( L_Skolnick , 1969 ; L_Fogelson , 1971 ; L_Edelman , 1971 ; L_Knopf , 1975 ) , this L_issue has M_received L_relatively L_little L_attention in L_Britain ."
as6-fragment02,381,"L_Nevertheless , during the 1980–1 L_events and their L_aftermath the L_political M_context was L_discussed from a M_number of M_perspectives ."
as6-fragment02,382,"The L_Scarman L_Report , for L_example , M_located M_part of the L_explanation for the L_riots in the L_feelings of L_alienation and M_powerlessness which were L_experienced by L_young L_blacks L_living in M_depressed L_inner-city L_areas ."
as6-fragment02,383,"A L_successful L_policy for M_tackling the M_roots of L_urban M_disorder was M_seen as one which M_sought to L_involve all the L_community in L_dealing with the L_problems of each L_area so that they could M_come to M_feel that they have a M_stake in its L_future ( L_Scarman , 1981 , para. 6.42 ) ."
as6-fragment02,384,"Where such L_arguments did not L_fit in with the L_overarching L_themes of L_race , L_violence and M_disorder , and L_social L_deprivation they were L_either M_sidelined or M_pushed into the L_sub-clauses of L_official L_reports ."
as6-fragment02,385,"The L_Scarman L_Report , for L_example , M_contained the L_following L_policy L_proposal : ‘ I L_recommend that L_local L_communities must be L_fully and L_effectively L_involved in M_planning , in the L_provision of L_local L_services , and in the L_management and L_financing of L_specific L_projects , ( L_Scarman , 1981 , para. 8.44 ) ."
as6-fragment02,386,Such a M_move towards M_greater L_political L_integration was M_seen by L_Lord L_Scarman as L_essential if the M_gap between L_inner-city L_residents and the M_forces of L_law and M_order was to be M_bridged .
as6-fragment02,387,"But the L_concern with M_overcoming L_political L_marginality M_remained on the M_sidelines of the L_main L_public L_debate because it M_questioned the L_perception of the L_rioters as M_driven by L_irrational , L_uncivilized , and L_criminal L_instincts ."
as6-fragment02,388,"This did not , L_however , M_stop the L_question of L_political L_marginality and the L_need to L_reform L_existing L_policies from being M_raised at all , as can be M_seen L_subsequently by the L_attempts after 1981 to L_introduce both L_locally and L_nationally M_measures which were L_meant to M_address some of the L_grievances of the L_rioters and to L_ensure that further L_disturbances did not L_occur ."
as6-fragment02,389,M_Aspects of these M_measures are L_considered further on in the L_chapter .
as6-fragment02,390,M_PERSPECTIVES ON THE 1985 L_RIOTS
as6-fragment02,391,"Despite L_widespread L_predictions of further L_unrest in the L_aftermath of 1981 , the M_scale and the L_location of the 1985 L_riots L_seem to have L_surprised L_even some of the most L_astute L_commentators ."
as6-fragment02,392,"L_Handsworth , for L_example , was M_presented L_even L_shortly before L_September 1985 as a ‘ L_success L_story ’ in L_terms of L_police — L_community L_relations ."
as6-fragment02,393,The L_outbreak of L_violence in this L_area was L_therefore L_widely M_presented as an L_aberration .
as6-fragment02,394,"L_Similarly the M_spread of L_violence in L_London to L_areas such as the L_Broadwater L_Farm L_Estate in L_Tottenham was M_seen as a M_break from L_previous L_experience , which had M_centred on L_areas such as L_Brixton ."
as6-fragment02,395,There are L_many M_continuities between 1980–1 and 1985 in L_relation to the L_common-sense M_images L_used in the L_press and L_television to M_cover the L_events .
as6-fragment02,396,"But M_responses in 1985 were L_different , at L_least in L_terms of M_degree , and L_probably in L_relation to the M_extent to which the L_riots were M_seen as a ‘ L_race ’ L_phenomenon by a M_wider M_body of L_opinion ."
as6-fragment02,397,The L_ambiguities and L_sub-clauses to be M_found in L_much of the L_press L_coverage during 1980–1 had at L_least M_acted as a L_countervailing L_tendency against the more L_extreme M_forms of L_discourse which M_blamed the L_riots L_completely on L_black L_people .
as6-fragment02,398,"During the 1985 L_riots and their L_immediate L_aftermath , the M_imagery of ‘ L_race ’ was M_used by M_sections of the L_press without the M_sense of L_ambiguity which could L_still be M_found in 1980–1 ."
as6-fragment02,399,"The ‘ L_silence over L_race ’ was M_breached in 1980–1 , but in 1985 L_debate about L_racial L_issues was M_taken a M_step further ."
as6-fragment02,400,"L_Peregrine L_Worsthorne , for L_example , L_used the L_ferocity of the L_confrontations in L_Handsworth , L_Brixton , and L_Tottenham to L_argue that there was a L_major M_question M_mark over the L_possibility of L_assimilating the ‘ M_coloured L_population ’ into L_mainstream ‘ L_British L_values ’ ( L_Sunday L_Telegraph , 29 L_September 1985 ) ."
as6-fragment02,401,"To be L_sure there was L_still a M_strong M_response L_opposing L_Enoch L_Powell 's M_call for L_repatriation , from all M_shades of L_political L_opinion , but the L_racialization of L_public L_debate about the 1985 L_riots M_went L_much further than 1980–1 ."
as6-fragment02,402,In this M_context it was the M_externality of L_British L_Afro-Caribbeans and L_Asians which was M_highlighted L_rather the L_racist L_institutions and L_processes which M_worked against L_blacks at all M_levels of L_society .
as6-fragment02,403,"The L_usage of ‘ L_race ’ during the L_September-October 1985 L_period M_took on L_new L_meanings , which had L_little if L_anything to do with the M_impact of L_racism as such , since the M_emphasis was on the L_cultural L_characteristics of the L_minority L_communities themselves ."
as6-fragment02,404,"After L_Handsworth M_part of the L_press M_response was to L_blame the L_riot on L_rivalry between L_West L_Indians and L_Asians , and L_even after the L_arguments were L_criticized by L_local L_residents ; and L_community L_leaders , they were L_used to ‘ L_explain ’ ' what L_happened ."
as6-fragment02,405,"In L_addition , the L_question whether the L_cultures and L_values of the L_black L_communities , their L_family M_structures , and their L_political M_attitudes ‘ M_bred L_violence ’ was L_constantly M_raised ( L_van L_Dijk , 1988 ) ."
as6-fragment02,406,"The L_actual L_facts ' of who was L_arrested during the L_riots , whether L_black or L_white , were L_hardly L_debated since it was M_assumed that they were L_mostly L_black and L_mostly L_unemployed and L_involved with L_crime ( L_Keith , 1987 ) ."
as6-fragment02,407,"The M_imagery of the ‘ L_black L_bomber , L_used in L_Handsworth was M_extended to the L_notion that there were L_groups of L_alienated and L_criminalized L_young L_blacks who M_saw the L_riots as a L_chance to M_engage in an ‘ M_orgy of L_looting ’ ."
as6-fragment02,408,The L_Dear L_Report on L_Handsworth M_captures this M_image and M_links it to the L_social L_condition of L_young L_blacks :
as6-fragment02,409,"The L_majority of L_rioters who M_took L_part in these M_unhappy L_events were L_young , L_black and L_Afro-Caribbean M_origin ."
as6-fragment02,410,"M_Let there be no L_doubt , these L_young L_criminals are not in any M_way L_representative of the M_vast L_majority of the L_Afro-Caribbean L_community whose L_life has M_contributed to the L_life and L_culture of the L_West L_Midlands over L_many L_years and whose L_hopes and L_aspirations are at one with those of every other L_law-abiding L_citizen ."
as6-fragment02,411,We M_share a L_common M_sorrow .
as6-fragment02,412,It is the L_duty of us all to L_ensure that an L_entire L_cultural L_group is not M_tainted by the L_actions of a L_criminal L_minority .
as6-fragment02,413,"( L_Dear , 1985 , p. 69 )"
as6-fragment02,414,"This ‘ L_black ’ L_criminal L_minority was M_constructed not only into the L_leading M_force behind the L_riots , but L_sometimes as the only L_force ."
as6-fragment02,415,"L_Indeed , throughout L_September and L_October 1985 , and during the L_following L_months , the M_imagery of L_race M_continued to M_dominate L_debate about both the L_causes and the L_policy L_outcomes of the L_riots ."
as6-fragment02,416,"As M_pointed out L_earlier , the ‘ L_social L_causes ’ L_argument was another L_major M_plank of L_public L_debate about the 1980–1 L_riots , L_particularly in L_relation to the L_highly L_politicized L_issue of L_unemployment ."
as6-fragment02,417,"During 1985 this L_issue was M_raised once again , though by then the M_extent of L_mass L_unemployment and L_urban L_de-industrialization and M_decay was more M_stark than it had been in 198l ."
as6-fragment02,418,"M_Images of ‘ L_urban M_decay ’ , ‘ M_tinderbox L_cities ’ , and ‘ M_ghetto L_streets ’ M_linked up with the M_images of ‘ L_race L_inequality ’ and ‘ M_black M_ghettos ’ to M_produce an L_analysis more L_complex but L_also more L_contradictory ."
as6-fragment02,419,An L_interesting M_mixture of the L_various M_images was L_provided by a L_story in the L_Daily L_Telegraph under the L_headline : ‘ L_Broadwater L_Farm : Like the M_Divis M_Flats with M_Reggae ’ ( 8 L_October 1985 ) .
as6-fragment02,420,"The L_Mirror M_described the L_estate as ‘ M_Living M_Hell ’ , and M_quoted one L_resident as L_saying that ‘ You 've no L_idea how L_awful L_daily L_life is ’ ( 8 L_October 1985 ) ."
as6-fragment02,421,"Such M_images were L_reworkings of L_arguments L_already L_used about L_Toxteth in 1981 and L_Brixton in 1981 , but they were L_used more L_widely than in 1980–1 ."
as6-fragment02,422,"L_Even the L_Daily L_Mail , which M_deployed the M_clearest M_use of ‘ L_race ’ and ‘ M_outside L_agitator ’ L_arguments , M_ran a L_major L_story on L_Broadwater L_Farm under the L_headline : ‘ M_Burnt-out M_hulks M_litter this L_concrete M_jungle … L_despair M_hangs M_heavy ’ ( 8 L_October 1985 ) ."
as6-fragment02,423,"A M_number of L_stories L_using such M_imagery were M_run by both the L_quality and the L_popular L_press during this L_period , but L_similar L_arguments are to be M_found in L_parliamentary L_debates ( L_Hansard , vol. 84 , 21 L_October 1985 , cols. 30-.46 , 388 ) , and L_even in L_official L_reports L_produced by the L_police on the L_riots in L_Birmingham and L_London ."
as6-fragment02,424,"The ‘ L_cities of M_inner L_despair ’ were M_conceived as the M_breeding M_ground for M_disorderly L_protest , and L_however M_hard the L_Government L_tried to M_break the L_causal M_link between the two , it was M_forced to M_take on M_board the L_need to M_restore M_order not only through the L_police but through L_promises of L_help for the L_inner L_cities ."
as6-fragment02,425,"L_Much as in 1980–1 , the ‘ L_social L_causes ’ L_argument can not be M_seen M_separately from the M_broader L_debate about the L_future of the L_British L_economy and L_society ."
as6-fragment02,426,"The L_Government 's L_record on L_unemployment was a M_heavily L_politicized L_issue , and just as in 1981 it L_vehemently M_denied any L_responsibility for the L_riots through its M_pursuit of M_free-market L_policies ."
as6-fragment02,427,But the L_Government did M_find a M_way of L_accepting a M_link between the L_riots and L_social L_problems without M_bringing its L_main L_policies into the L_debate : L_namely by M_linking the M_growth of L_violent M_disorder to L_crime and L_drugs .
as6-fragment02,428,The M_emphasis on ‘ L_crime ’ and the ‘ L_criminal M_acts ’ of the L_rioters in the L_official M_responses to the 1985 L_riots M_took a L_general and a L_specific M_form .
as6-fragment02,429,"The L_general M_form M_relied on the L_argument that the L_riots were not a M_form of L_protest against the L_insufferable L_social L_conditions of L_inner-city L_areas or the L_actions of the L_police , but a ‘ L_criminal M_act ’ or a ‘ M_cry for M_loot ’ ."
as6-fragment02,430,"This was an L_argument M_put most L_succinctly by L_Geoffrey L_Dear , L_Chief L_Constable of the L_West L_Midlands ( L_Dear , 1985 ) and by L_Douglas L_Hurd , the L_Home L_Secretary , in L_relation to L_Handsworth ."
as6-fragment02,431,But it L_recurred as a L_theme in L_official and L_press M_responses to the other L_riots .
as6-fragment02,432,"The L_specific M_form was M_built upon the L_notion that the L_outbreak of L_violence in L_Handsworth and L_Brixton , in L_particular , was L_brought about by ‘ L_drug L_barons ’ who M_saw the L_police L_attempting to L_curb their L_activities and L_control ‘ their L_territory ’ ."
as6-fragment02,433,"L_Numerous L_examples of this M_line of L_argument can be M_found in L_Dear 's L_report on L_Handsworth , and in L_press L_coverage during the L_riots ."
as6-fragment02,434,"M_Taking the L_specific L_argument about the M_role of L_drugs and ‘ L_drug L_barons ’ in L_stimulating the L_riots , this L_seems to have M_served two L_purposes ."
as6-fragment02,435,"L_First , it M_distanced the L_riots from the L_social , L_economic , L_political , and other M_grievances which had been M_linked to them by M_locating the L_cause outside the ‘ L_social L_problems ’ of L_inner-city L_dwellers and in the ‘ L_simple L_greed ’ of the L_drug M_barons to L_accumulate ‘ M_loot ’ ."
as6-fragment02,436,"L_Second , just as L_Dear 's M_image of a few hundred ‘ L_young L_black L_criminals ’ was L_used to L_explain what L_happened in L_Handsworth , the L_problem of L_drugs was L_used to L_explain what L_happened at a L_national M_level ."
as6-fragment02,437,"The L_issue of L_drugs L_provided an L_everyday M_image , L_already a L_national L_issue through M_saturation L_media L_coverage and L_public L_debate , around which the L_police , the L_Home L_Office , and other L_institutions could M_depoliticize the L_riots ."
as6-fragment02,438,"L_Responding to the L_Handsworth L_events L_Douglas L_Hurd was M_moved to L_argue M_forcibly that such L_events were M_senseless and M_reflected more on those who L_participated in them than on the L_society in which they M_took M_place : ‘ The L_sound which L_law L_abiding L_people in L_Handsworth L_heard on L_Monday L_night , the M_echoes of which I M_picked up on L_Tuesday , was not a M_cry for L_help but a M_cry for M_loot ’ ( L_Financial L_Times , 13 L_September 1985 ) ."
as6-fragment02,439,"The L_Chief L_Constable for the L_West L_Midlands , L_Geoffrey L_Dear , M_took this L_argument further by M_pointing out that the L_day before the L_riots a L_successful L_carnival had M_taken M_place , with the M_support of L_local L_community L_leaders ."
as6-fragment02,440,"He M_drew the L_conclusion from this that the L_riot ‘ M_came like a M_bolt out of the M_blue ’ ( L_Guardian , 21 L_November 1985 ) ."
as6-fragment02,441,"Such L_language M_focused L_attention on the L_individuals or L_groups who were ‘ M_breaking the L_law ’ , ‘ M_committing L_criminal L_acts ’ , and M_threatening the L_interests of the L_law-abiding ‘ L_majority ’ ."

b1g-fragment02,741,"L_Given the M_extent to which L_geographic L_information L_management is M_applications L_driven , it is L_important to M_consider in some M_depth the L_characteristics of some L_potential M_application M_fields ."
b1g-fragment02,742,In the L_process it will be L_necessary to M_examine not only the M_extent to which L_geographic L_issues L_feature on the L_policy L_issues L_agenda in these M_fields but L_also the L_institutional M_context which M_governs L_decision-making and the M_extent to which L_data are L_available for L_research and L_policy L_analysis L_purposes .
b1g-fragment02,743,M_Questions on L_data L_availability are L_likely to be L_particularly L_important where L_users are M_heavily L_dependent on L_secondary M_sources .
b1g-fragment02,744,In M_situations of this L_kind M_provisions M_governing M_access and M_format may M_exert M_powerful L_constraints on the L_use that can be M_made of these L_data .
b1g-fragment02,745,The L_first four L_chapters in this M_part M_examine L_issues L_relating to L_geographic L_information M_handling in L_terms of four L_potential M_applications M_fields .
b1g-fragment02,746,The L_authors were L_asked to L_review the L_current M_state of the M_art in their M_fields with L_particular L_reference to the L_likely L_requirements of the L_future L_policy L_issues L_agenda in L_terms of the L_demands that they M_make on L_geographic L_information L_management .
b1g-fragment02,747,L_Authors were L_also L_asked to L_evaluate L_critically the M_state of L_geographic L_information L_provision in L_terms of the L_needs of L_users and to M_consider the M_impact of L_user L_requirements on the L_development of L_geographic L_information M_handling L_methodology .
b1g-fragment02,748,In this M_way the L_chapters in this M_part M_present a L_number of M_perspectives which L_essentially L_complement and M_amplify the M_discussion in the L_previous M_part .
b1g-fragment02,749,"In this L_case , L_however , L_methodological L_issues are M_tackled from a L_largely L_user L_standpoint , whereas in the L_previous M_part they were M_viewed as L_substantive L_problems in their own L_right ."
b1g-fragment02,750,In L_effect the M_product of the M_discussion in both M_parts is a M_matrix where the L_methodological L_issues are M_listed along one M_axis and L_particular M_applications M_fields on the other .
b1g-fragment02,751,L_Figure 8.1 M_summarizes the L_main M_features of this L_matrix .
b1g-fragment02,752,There are L_important L_differences between the L_chapters in this M_part both in the M_nature of the L_demands that they M_make on L_geographic L_information and L_also in the L_relative L_importance that is M_attached to L_geographic L_criteria as against other L_issues by L_planners and L_decision-makers in these M_fields .
b1g-fragment02,753,"The L_first three L_chapters M_dealing with L_environmental L_monitoring , L_natural and L_technological L_hazards and L_settlements and L_infrastructure M_applications M_make L_use of a very M_wide M_range of L_geographic L_information ."
b1g-fragment02,754,A L_major M_feature of these M_applications is the M_extent to which they L_involve M_overlays of a L_variety of L_information M_drawn from L_different M_sources on a L_topographic L_map M_base .
b1g-fragment02,755,for this L_reason they M_make L_particularly M_heavy L_demands on L_current L_GIS L_technology both because of the M_size of the L_data L_sets and the L_diversity of the L_data M_structures that are L_involved .
b1g-fragment02,756,L_Brown 's L_chapter on L_geodemographics M_discusses an M_application M_field where L_primary L_data M_collected for L_operational L_purposes are L_typically L_evaluated in L_relation to L_secondary L_data M_derived from M_sources such as the L_Census of L_Population .
b1g-fragment02,757,The M_range of L_data L_sets L_involved and the L_demands that are M_made on L_GIS L_technology in M_applications of this L_kind are L_often more L_limited than those of L_previous M_applications M_fields .
b1g-fragment02,758,"L_However , this is L_offset by the L_demands that are M_made on L_spatial L_analysis and M_modelling L_methodology ."
b1g-fragment02,759,L_Rhind 's L_chapter on L_environmental L_monitoring and L_prediction M_discusses the M_role of L_geographic L_information L_management in L_promoting L_sustainable L_development on a L_global M_scale in the M_context of the L_issues M_identified in the L_Brundtland L_report .
b1g-fragment02,760,It M_points to the M_impact that the L_findings of L_global L_environmental L_research are L_likely to have on most M_sectors of the L_UK L_economy .
b1g-fragment02,761,This M_contribution L_also M_indicates the M_wide L_variety of L_groups that are L_involved in L_monitoring L_environmental M_change and M_draws L_attention to the M_role that the L_European L_Community is L_increasingly M_playing in M_co-ordinating these L_efforts .
b1g-fragment02,762,One of the L_examples of L_work in M_progress M_discusses L_research that has been L_carried out for the L_European L_Commission as M_part of the L_CORINE L_Project .
b1g-fragment02,763,"This M_highlights the M_challenges for L_research in a M_field L_categorized by a L_lack of L_data for some L_countries , L_varying L_definitions and M_standards in L_use , and L_unreasonably M_high L_user L_expectations ."
b1g-fragment02,764,The L_chapter as a L_whole M_draws L_attention to a L_number of L_key L_methodological L_issues that are L_involved in L_environmental L_monitoring and L_prediction .
b1g-fragment02,765,"These M_include the L_highly L_specialized M_nature of L_much of the L_technical L_analysis , the L_limited M_capacity for L_checking the L_accuracy of L_many of the L_findings of this L_kind of L_research and the L_consequent L_need for the L_development of M_knowledge-based L_inference L_machines for M_extracting L_useful L_information from L_secondary and L_often L_proxy L_data ."
b1g-fragment02,766,"In L_Chapter 10 L_Gatrell and L_Vincent L_consider a L_wide L_range of L_natural and L_technological L_hazards L_including L_industrial L_hazards , L_risk L_assessment , L_hazardous L_waste L_disposal , L_emergency L_planning , L_natural L_hazards and L_environmental L_epidemiology ."

b1g-fragment02,769,In L_applications of this L_kind the L_authors L_argue that L_geographic L_information L_management in L_general and L_GIS in L_particular have an L_important L_role to L_play and they L_give a L_number of L_examples from L_research in L_progress to L_illustrate the L_current L_state of the L_art in this L_field .
b1g-fragment02,770,"The L_discussion of L_operational L_problems and L_prospects further L_amplifies L_many of the L_issues L_raised in L_preceding L_chapters , L_particularly with L_respect to the L_problems L_caused by the L_dependency on L_secondary L_data L_sources and the L_need for L_much more L_detailed L_geographic L_information to L_overcome some of the L_problems L_associated with L_linking L_data L_sets ."

b1g-fragment02,777,"L_Shepherd , more than any other L_contributor to this L_section , L_draws L_attention to the L_extent to which L_current L_efforts in the L_geographic L_information L_management L_field are L_constrained by the L_highly L_fragmented L_nature of both L_data L_suppliers and L_users both in L_sectoral and L_spatial L_terms , the L_great L_diversity of L_data L_sets in L_varying L_formats and the L_difficulties L_presented by L_institutional L_factors such as L_copyright L_provision , L_data L_ownership and the L_control of L_access to L_data ."

b1g-fragment02,781,L_Brown L_demonstrates the L_extent to which the L_growth of L_research L_activities in this L_field has L_led to the L_emergence of L_improved L_cluster L_analytic L_methods for the L_multidimensional L_classification of L_people L_according to the L_type of L_area in which they L_live .
b1g-fragment02,782,"In the L_last L_part of this L_contribution , L_Brown L_identifies a L_number of L_priorities for L_future L_research ."
b1g-fragment02,783,"Like L_Gatrell and L_Vincent and L_Shepherd before him , he is L_concerned with the L_lack of L_detailed L_geographical L_information L_particularly in this L_case with L_reference to the L_years between L_censuses ."
b1g-fragment02,784,L_Spatial L_linkages L_also L_feature L_prominently in L_Brown 's L_discussion which L_amplifies L_many of the L_points L_made in the L_earlier L_contribution from L_Openshaw in L_Chapter 3 .
b1g-fragment02,785,The L_analysis L_points to the L_need for the L_development of a L_fuzzy L_geodemographics L_methodology which L_takes L_account of the L_effects of L_different L_types of L_spatial L_errors .
b1g-fragment02,786,Other L_major L_research L_priorities for the L_future in this L_applications L_field are the L_development of L_response-modelling L_techniques to L_explore the L_factors L_affecting L_consumer L_choice .

b1g-fragment02,794,This is L_particularly L_evident in the L_demand for the L_development of L_knowledge-based L_decision L_support L_systems and L_modelling L_capabilities .
b1g-fragment02,795,Such L_demands L_highlight the L_extent to which L_geographic L_information L_management must be L_regarded as a L_means to an L_end L_rather than an L_end in itself when L_viewed from the L_standpoints of the L_needs of L_planners and L_decision-makers .

b1g-fragment02,805,L_Introduction
b1g-fragment02,806,"L_Monitoring of the L_state of and the L_changes in the L_environment is now L_universally L_recognized as being of L_profound L_importance to L_mankind ( L_Tickell 1986 , 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,807,"This L_awareness is most L_obviously L_manifested by the L_frequent L_appearance of L_press L_reports on L_ozone L_depletion , on the L_greenhouse L_effect and L_possible L_global L_warming , on L_nitrate L_pollution , on L_deforestation in the L_Tropics , on L_decreasing L_biological L_diversity and on L_many other L_environmentally L_related L_topics ."
b1g-fragment02,808,L_Usually these L_reports L_concentrate on L_prophecies of a L_forthcoming L_Armageddon but L_many L_also L_describe a L_dire L_contemporary L_situation .
b1g-fragment02,809,L_Thus the L_algal L_bloom off the L_Italian L_Adriatic L_shore in 1989 is L_reckoned to have L_caused the L_holiday L_trade and L_local L_fisherman L_losses L_running into L_tens if not L_hundreds of L_millions of L_pounds .
b1g-fragment02,810,"More L_globally , the L_Brundtland L_Report ( L_WCED 1987 ) L_noted that , in the 900 L_days during which the L_World L_Commission was at L_work ,"
b1g-fragment02,811,1 .
b1g-fragment02,812,The L_African L_drought L_put the L_lives of 35 million L_people at L_risk and may have L_killed 1 million of them ;
b1g-fragment02,813,2 .
b1g-fragment02,814,The L_Bhopal L_accident L_killed 2000 and L_injured 200 000 more ;
b1g-fragment02,815,3 .
b1g-fragment02,816,The L_Chernobyl L_disaster L_caused L_environmental L_damage across L_Europe ;
b1g-fragment02,817,4 .
b1g-fragment02,818,A L_chemical L_fire in L_Switzerland L_caused L_toxic L_materials to be L_transported by the L_Rhine at L_least as L_far as the L_Netherlands ;
b1g-fragment02,819,5 .
b1g-fragment02,820,At L_least 60 million L_people L_died of L_diarrhoeal L_diseases L_caused by L_malnutrition and L_dirty L_water .
b1g-fragment02,821,"As a L_consequence of these and other L_disasters , of L_rapid and L_world-wide L_broadcasting of them and of the L_concerned L_action of L_many L_individuals , the L_environment is now ‘ L_moving L_fast up the L_political L_agenda ’ ( L_Patten 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,822,"The then L_Prime L_Minister L_also L_emphasized the L_political L_awakening to the L_environment in L_statements such as : ‘ it is L_possible that with all these L_enormous L_changes ( L_population , L_agricultural , L_use of L_fossil L_fuels ) L_concentrated into such a L_short L_period of L_time , we have L_unwittingly L_begun a L_massive L_experiment with the L_system of this L_planet itself ’ ( L_Thatcher 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,823,The L_political L_concern is not L_altruistic .
b1g-fragment02,824,"L_Mrs L_Thatcher , a L_recent L_convert to L_environmental L_conservation , L_clearly L_held the L_opinion that L_environmental L_problems are not only L_soluble but that L_solving them can be L_shown to be L_cost-effective :"
b1g-fragment02,825,"In the L_past when we L_identified L_forms of L_pollution , we have L_shown our L_capacity to L_act L_effectively ."
b1g-fragment02,826,The L_great L_London L_smogs are now only a L_nightmare of the L_past .
b1g-fragment02,827,We have L_cut L_airborne L_lead by 50 per L_cent .
b1g-fragment02,828,"We are L_spending £4 billion on L_cleansing the L_Mersey L_Basin L_alone , and the L_Thames now has the L_cleanest L_metropolitan L_estuary in the L_world ."
b1g-fragment02,829,"L_Even though this L_kind of L_action may L_cost a L_lot , I L_believe it to be L_money L_well and L_necessarily L_spent because the L_health of our L_economy and the L_health of our L_environment are L_totally L_dependent upon each other … ."
b1g-fragment02,830,The L_Government L_espouses the L_concept of L_sustainable L_economic L_development .
b1g-fragment02,831,L_Stable L_prosperity can be L_achieved throughout the L_world L_provided the L_environment is L_nurtured and L_safeguarded ( L_Thatcher 1988 ) .
b1g-fragment02,832,The L_primary L_official L_manifestation of this L_UK L_commitment to the L_environment has been the L_government 's L_White L_Paper ( L_HMSO 1990 ) .
b1g-fragment02,833,"While L_criticized by L_many on the L_grounds that it had few ‘ L_teeth ’ and L_represented a L_compromise between the L_DoE and all other L_departments ( L_notably those of L_Agriculture and of L_Transport ) , it was L_none the L_less a L_major L_achievement ."
b1g-fragment02,834,"Its L_main L_sections L_dealt with the L_government 's L_approach to the L_environment ( L_nationally , at the L_European L_level and L_globally ) , the L_nature and L_effects of the L_greenhouse L_effect , L_environmental L_problems in both L_rural and L_urban L_areas ( L_especially in L_relation to L_land-use L_matters ) , L_pollution L_control and L_enhancing L_awareness of L_environmental L_matters ."
b1g-fragment02,835,L_Central to this L_approach is L_said to be an L_emphasis upon L_guidance from the L_best L_available L_scientific L_evidence .
b1g-fragment02,836,There is L_also a L_clear L_recognition of the L_need for L_monitoring and L_modelling of the L_state of the L_natural and L_man-influenced L_environment .
b1g-fragment02,837,"Though there has been a L_change of L_Prime L_Minister and of the L_Secretary of L_State for the L_Environment since the L_publication of the L_White L_Paper , the L_environmental L_cause L_seems as L_strong as L_ever ."
b1g-fragment02,838,"L_Thus , The L_Times of 17 L_December 1990 L_reported that a L_group of 40 of the most L_senior L_Civil L_Servants had L_met the L_previous L_weekend to L_discuss ‘ L_ways in which the L_government L_machine could L_respond L_better to L_national and L_international L_problems such as the L_threat of L_global L_climate L_change ’ ."
b1g-fragment02,839,"L_Pearce et al. ( 1989 ) have L_argued that the L_effects of L_government , L_commercial and other L_actions on the L_environment can and should be L_assessed on a cost/benefit L_basis and this L_seems L_likely to be the L_basis on which at L_least the L_UK L_government will L_proceed ."
b1g-fragment02,840,"L_Given such a L_lead , it is L_scarcely L_surprising that L_British L_scientists have L_sought to L_demonstrate the L_practical and L_financial L_consequences of L_environmental L_events and L_processes ; L_Table 9.1 , for L_example L_illustrates their L_perception of the L_importance of L_global L_environmental L_research to the L_UK L_domestic L_economy ."
b1g-fragment02,841,"If it now L_seems L_self-evident that L_monitoring of the L_global L_environment is L_necessary , L_indeed is L_even L_vital , the L_prediction of what is L_likely to L_happen is L_almost as L_important : the 170 000 L_people in the L_Maldives are L_understandably L_worried about the L_prospect of L_global L_sea-level L_change since no L_part of the L_islands is more than 2 m above L_present L_sea-level !"
b1g-fragment02,842,"L_Yet , as we shall L_see below , the L_prediction of the L_activities of L_natural and L_man-influenced L_environmental L_systems L_requires an L_understanding of the L_interaction of L_processes that , in L_many L_cases , we L_simply do not L_yet have ."
b1g-fragment02,843,"L_Even L_monitoring of the L_present is very L_imperfect , as L_witness the L_order of L_magnitude L_variations in L_estimates now L_current for L_deforestation L_rates ."
b1g-fragment02,844,"This L_chapter , then , L_attempts to L_review some of the L_problems in L_environmental L_monitoring and L_prediction , L_describes some of the L_relevant L_scientific and L_organizational L_activities and L_looks L_ahead to what is L_likely to L_happen L_next ."
b1g-fragment02,845,The L_nature of L_environmental L_processes
b1g-fragment02,846,"Notwithstanding L_Mrs L_Thatcher 's L_confidence that we can ‘ L_fix ’ L_environmental L_problems , the L_difficulties L_associated with a L_task L_even as L_apparently L_simple as L_monitoring a L_state L_variable are L_considerable ."
b1g-fragment02,847,"Some of the L_reasons for this — the L_difficulty of L_deciding on L_appropriate L_proxy L_variables and on L_economical yet L_non-biasing L_temporal and L_spatial L_sampling L_frameworks , L_taking L_account of the L_relative L_importance of L_aperiodic and L_rare L_events as L_compared to L_near-continuous L_processes , L_processing the L_vast L_volumes of L_data L_usually L_involved and L_organizing the L_multidisciplinary and ( L_often ) L_multinational L_researchers L_involved — are L_discussed L_briefly L_later ."
b1g-fragment02,848,"L_Even at this L_stage , L_however , it is L_important to L_stress that we have a very L_incomplete L_understanding of L_many L_processes in the L_natural L_environment ."
b1g-fragment02,849,The L_next L_section L_therefore L_attempts to L_summarize what we do L_know ; it is L_derived L_chiefly from the L_Earth L_System L_Sciences L_Committee ( L_ESSC ) ( 1988 ) .
b1g-fragment02,850,L_Temporal and L_spatial L_scales of L_operation
b1g-fragment02,851,"L_Even L_ignoring the L_effects of L_man , L_earth L_system L_processes L_operate at a L_variety of L_spatial and L_temporal L_scales ( L_see Fig. 9.1 ; L_see L_also L_Rosswall et al. 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,852,"L_Thus L_microclimate L_effects can have L_major L_short-term L_implications for L_local L_populations ( such as those L_brought about by the L_photochemical L_smogs of L_Los L_Angeles ) , are L_often L_applicable only over L_areas of a few L_hectares or L_less and may L_operate on a L_diurnal L_cycle ."
b1g-fragment02,853,"In L_contrast , L_soil L_creation ( cf. L_soil L_degradation ) may L_require L_hundreds or L_thousands of L_years ."
b1g-fragment02,854,In between are L_variations in L_phenomena such as L_El L_Nino .
b1g-fragment02,855,The L_sampling L_theorem L_indicates that we must L_sample these L_phenomena at a L_frequency of no L_less than half their L_wavelength if we are to L_avoid L_bias in L_measurement .
b1g-fragment02,856,"In this L_chapter , the L_primary L_concern is with L_changes L_occurring over L_time L_spans from L_minutes to L_centuries and from L_spatial L_wavelengths from about 1 m to about 100 L_km ."
b1g-fragment02,857,"It is , L_however , L_impossible to L_separate out L_processes L_acting at L_different L_scales and over L_different L_periods : a L_single L_volcanic L_eruption L_lasting L_hours or L_days L_sometimes L_leads to L_dust and L_gas being L_ejected into the L_atmosphere over a L_period of L_months and this in L_turn may L_lead to L_global L_climatic L_fluctuations over L_years or L_decades ."
b1g-fragment02,858,"L_Conversely , a L_large-scale and L_long-period L_phenomenon such as the L_movement of L_tectonic L_plates can L_lead to L_local L_stress L_accumulation and to its L_release by an L_earthquake in a few L_seconds and with L_highly L_local L_effects ."
b1g-fragment02,859,This L_therefore has the L_following L_consequences :
b1g-fragment02,860,1 .
b1g-fragment02,861,We should L_know L_something about the L_periodicity of the L_variables we are L_monitoring if we are not to L_risk either L_unnecessarily L_detailed L_data L_collection or L_aliasing of L_trends ;
b1g-fragment02,862,2 .
b1g-fragment02,863,"Since we L_know that the L_periodicity of some L_variables is L_longer than the L_monitoring L_already L_carried out by L_human beings , we must L_make L_use of L_surrogate or L_proxy L_variables to L_extend our L_range of L_knowledge ( such as via L_tree L_rings , L_palynology , L_oxygen L_isotope L_ratios from L_ice L_cores and L_geomorphological L_evidence of L_environmental L_change ) ;"
b1g-fragment02,864,3 .
b1g-fragment02,865,"Since we are not L_yet L_able to L_predict all the L_interactions which may be L_important in a L_study of L_environmental L_problems , L_collecting L_potentially L_useful L_data as L_well as those L_believed L_central to the L_problem under L_study is L_often L_wise ;"
b1g-fragment02,866,4 .
b1g-fragment02,867,We must L_accept that most L_data L_collection L_exercises will L_inevitably be a L_compromise on the L_grounds of L_cost and L_hence L_less than L_perfect L_data L_sets will be L_produced ;
b1g-fragment02,868,5 .
b1g-fragment02,869,"L_Irrespective of the L_use of L_surrogates , L_monitoring L_environmental L_processes only L_makes L_sense over L_time-scales which are L_extended by L_human L_standards ( L_hence the L_IGBP ( L_see below ) is L_designed to L_run for two or three L_decades ) ;"
b1g-fragment02,870,6 .
b1g-fragment02,871,L_Changes in L_political L_priorities may L_simply L_result in the L_need for L_informed L_guesswork if L_suitable L_data are not L_available .
b1g-fragment02,872,L_Much L_attention will be L_given throughout this L_chapter to L_monitoring the L_environment on a L_global L_basis .
b1g-fragment02,873,This is not L_merely because of its L_topical L_nature .
b1g-fragment02,874,The L_main L_reason is that — though some L_problems are L_local and are L_best L_studied that L_way — L_many L_others ( L_even L_involving a L_limited L_geographical L_extent ) are L_best L_understood within a L_global L_framework .
b1g-fragment02,875,L_Thus no L_meteorologist would L_attempt to L_forecast the L_weather 2 or 3 L_days L_ahead without L_using a L_mathematical L_model L_based on L_observations from all around the L_world .
b1g-fragment02,876,"L_Moreover , L_recent L_work has L_shown that L_much of the L_heat L_energy in the L_seas of the L_North L_Atlantic ( every L_square L_kilometre of which L_gives off as L_much L_energy as a L_nuclear L_power L_station and L_hence L_influences our L_weather ) is L_absorbed from L_sunlight in the L_tropical L_Pacific and is L_carried by L_ocean L_currents through the L_Drake L_Passage and up into the L_Atlantic ."
b1g-fragment02,877,"L_Thus , to L_understand some L_local and L_many L_regional , L_national and L_continental and all L_global L_environmental L_events , we L_need to have a L_global L_perspective and L_hold L_global L_databases ( L_Rhind and L_Mounsey 1989 ; L_Mounsey and L_Tomlinson 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,878,"In no L_way , L_however , does this L_invalidate the L_need for L_microscale L_studies — for L_instance , while L_global L_data L_sets may L_indicate the L_extent of L_algal L_blooms and may L_suggest L_causes of them , only L_detailed L_study of the L_algae themselves can L_provide L_understanding of why the L_bloom is L_occurring ."
b1g-fragment02,879,The L_processes themselves
b1g-fragment02,880,"A L_major L_complication , L_however , is that the L_environment can L_rarely be L_treated as in a L_laboratory L_experiment ."
b1g-fragment02,881,"L_Given this , L_determining the L_nature of the L_interactions between the L_variables L_becomes a L_matter of L_major L_difficulty ."
b1g-fragment02,882,"L_Figure 9.2 is L_taken from L_ESSC ( 1988 ) and is an L_attempt to L_show the L_interactions between L_environmental L_processes , as L_well as the L_indicators and L_implications of L_change in the L_state of the L_environment ."
b1g-fragment02,883,"In L_essence , the L_figure can be L_summarized as L_showing L_processes within the L_physical L_climate L_system and within the L_biogeochemical one , these L_systems being L_interwoven by the L_global L_role of L_water and L_increasingly L_affected by L_human L_activities ."
b1g-fragment02,884,The L_main L_components of the L_first L_system are L_well L_known : the L_atmosphere is its L_engine and L_atmospheric L_circulation is L_driven by L_differences in L_solar L_heating between the L_equatorial and L_polar L_regions .
b1g-fragment02,885,"We are , L_however , L_becoming L_ever more L_aware of the L_massive L_influence of L_oceans on our L_climate ; L_research into ocean/atmosphere L_interactions is now a L_priority ."
b1g-fragment02,886,"In L_ocean L_dynamics L_studies , L_important L_topics are L_heat L_storage , L_circulation and the L_role of L_sea L_ice ."
b1g-fragment02,887,"L_Atmospheric L_circulation ( and , in L_turn , L_precipitation and L_temperature ) is L_also L_greatly L_affected by the L_balance of L_thermal L_energy at the L_land L_surface , itself L_affected by the L_vegetation and L_terrain L_characteristics ."
b1g-fragment02,888,"The L_biogeochemical L_system L_embraces the L_totality of the L_movements of the L_key L_elements L_essential to L_life — L_carbon , L_nitrogen , L_oxygen , L_phosphorus and L_others — through what has been L_described as the L_total L_earth L_system ."
b1g-fragment02,889,The L_oceans and their L_biota L_play a L_central L_role in the L_carbon and L_nutrient L_cycles ; L_global L_ocean L_circulation is L_also L_critical to the L_global L_carbon L_budget .
b1g-fragment02,890,"L_Trace L_gases in the L_atmosphere are L_key L_components of the L_cycles of such L_elements as L_carbon , L_nitrogen , L_oxygen , L_sulphur and the L_halogens ; as is now L_well L_known , their L_concentrations are L_much L_influenced by L_biogenic and L_anthropogenic L_activities and the L_concentrations of such L_gases as L_carbon L_dioxide , L_ozone , L_methane , L_nitrous L_oxide and the L_chlorofluoromethanes ( L_CFMs ) L_strongly L_affect L_radiative L_transfer and L_provide a L_link with the L_physical L_climate L_system ."
b1g-fragment02,891,"A L_particular L_cause for L_concern is that the L_concentrations of the two L_main L_CFMs is L_increasing by about 5 per L_cent per L_annum while the L_equivalent L_figures for L_methane , L_nitrous L_oxide and L_carbon L_dioxide are 1 , 0.4 and 0.3 per L_cent ."
b1g-fragment02,892,"L_Finally , the L_chemistry of the L_stratosphere is L_dominated by the L_photochemical L_production and L_catalytic L_destruction of L_ozone ."
b1g-fragment02,893,There are L_several L_important L_ways in which L_biogeochemical L_processes can L_influence L_climate and L_hence L_habitability ( except where the L_latter is L_maintained at L_enormous L_cost ) .
b1g-fragment02,894,"If , for L_instance , the L_concentrations of L_certain L_trace L_gases ( L_see above ) L_continue to L_increase , it has been L_predicted that the L_earth 's L_surface L_temperature will L_increase by an L_amount L_comparable to that since the L_last L_major L_phase of the most L_recent L_glaciation ( about 18 000 L_years L_BP ) — though there is some L_dispute about the L_magnitude of the L_likely L_change ."
b1g-fragment02,895,"The L_converse L_case — the L_effect of L_physical L_climate L_changes on L_biogeochemical L_processes — is L_also of L_obvious L_importance : L_changes in L_annual L_averages and L_cycles of L_temperature and L_precipitation , L_together with the L_probabilities of L_extreme L_events such as L_prolonged L_droughts or L_frosts , are L_major L_determinants of L_terrestrial L_ecosystem L_type , at L_least in L_areas L_largely L_unaffected by L_human L_activity ."
b1g-fragment02,896,L_Human-induced L_changes to the L_environment have L_increased L_rapidly as a L_consequence of L_growing L_population L_numbers and of L_numerous L_developments in L_technology .
b1g-fragment02,897,"L_fossil L_fuel L_combustion , for L_instance , has L_led to L_increased L_concentrations of L_sulphate in L_precipitation ( ’ L_acid L_rain' ) and L_many L_rivers , L_lakes and L_estuaries have been L_greatly L_affected by L_phosphates from L_agricultural , L_urban or L_industrial L_sources ."
b1g-fragment02,898,"It should be L_stressed , L_however , that — while the L_outlines of L_human L_activities are L_clear — there are L_still L_many L_uncertainties : for L_instance , we L_know that the L_atmospheric L_concentration of L_carbon L_dioxide has L_risen about 9 per L_cent since 1959 ."
b1g-fragment02,899,"But L_calculations of the L_total L_carbon L_released by L_fossil L_fuel L_combustion L_imply that , if all such L_carbon L_remained in the L_atmosphere , the L_concentration would have L_increased by L_twice as L_much ."
b1g-fragment02,900,"The L_absolute L_difference between the two L_figures L_seems to be L_due to two L_different L_factors : L_absorption by the L_oceans and other L_reductions in L_carbon L_stocks in L_living L_biota , the L_latter being L_strongly L_affected by L_human L_activities since the L_Industrial L_Revolution ."
b1g-fragment02,901,Does L_God L_play L_dice ?
b1g-fragment02,902,L_Much L_environmental L_prediction is L_predicated upon a L_logical L_positivist or L_Newtonian L_deterministic L_basis .
b1g-fragment02,903,"The L_environmental L_systems are L_effectively L_regarded as L_machines whose L_workings can all be L_discovered , L_described in L_differential L_equation L_form and whose L_future L_activities can L_thus be L_predicted in L_detail if their L_initial L_states are L_known ."
b1g-fragment02,904,"An L_argument by L_many L_atmospheric L_physicists , for L_example , is that L_shortcomings in the L_accuracy of L_weather L_prediction over L_periods of more than a few L_days L_largely L_results from the L_unsophisticated L_nature of L_existing L_models , the L_lack of L_suitable L_data and L_inadequate L_computer L_power ( L_see Fig. 9.3 , L_derived from L_Tyler 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,905,"In L_contrast , the L_advocates of L_chaos L_theory ( e.g. L_Stewart 1989 ) L_argue that some L_natural L_systems are so L_sensitive to L_tiny L_stimuli that L_even ‘ the L_faint L_beat of a L_butterfly 's L_wing could be the L_ultimate L_trigger for a L_hurricane ’ ."
b1g-fragment02,906,"In L_essence , they L_argue that L_tiny L_differences in the L_initial L_conditions of L_many L_systems can L_lead to L_widely L_different L_outcomes since the L_systems L_exhibit L_stochastic L_behaviour within a L_deterministic L_framework ."
b1g-fragment02,907,"If so , there is L_little L_chance of L_making L_accurate L_long-term L_forecasts of these L_systems ."
b1g-fragment02,908,"This has been L_recognized by , among L_others , L_ESSC ( 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,909,The L_authors of that L_report L_accepted that there is a L_theoretical L_limit of 2–3 L_weeks in L_explicit L_prediction of L_day-to-day L_fluctuations in L_weather because of the L_influence of L_small-scale L_turbulence within the L_large-scale L_dynamics ; such L_limits L_imply that L_medium and L_long-term L_prediction must L_inevitably be L_stochastic .
b1g-fragment02,910,"To L_complicate L_matters L_still further , L_however , it L_seems at L_least L_possible that the L_components of the L_earth L_system may L_best be L_predicted L_deterministically at some L_spatial and L_temporal L_scales but L_stochastically at L_others and that the L_basis of L_prediction will L_differ for L_different L_components ."
b1g-fragment02,911,"As an L_example , L_atmospheric L_temperature L_shows L_marked L_day-to-day L_variability , a L_strong L_seasonal L_cycle with some L_year-to-year L_variations , a L_weak L_minimum L_variability for 10–20 L_year L_averages and then L_increased L_variation again at L_longer L_time-scales ( L_ESSC 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,912,It need L_hardly be L_pointed out that L_coping with such L_multiple L_databases on which L_modelling is to be L_carried out is not a L_trivial L_exercise .
b1g-fragment02,913,"L_Finally , it is L_perhaps L_worth L_concluding this L_section by L_emphasizing that there is L_still L_much L_controversy among the L_scientific L_community about the L_magnitude of L_many of the L_effects being L_discussed ."
b1g-fragment02,914,"In L_general , the L_research L_work of the L_international L_groups of L_scientists , L_including those L_involved in the L_Inter-Governmental L_Committee and in the L_UK 's L_Inter-Agency L_Committee on L_Global L_Environmental L_Change , has L_progressively L_reduced the L_magnitude of the L_predicted L_effects of , for L_example , L_global L_warming ."
b1g-fragment02,915,"In L_giving the 1990 L_Robens L_Coal L_Science L_Lecture at the L_Royal L_Institution , L_Sir L_John L_Mason ( a L_former L_Director of the L_Meteorological L_Office ) L_urged L_caution in L_interpreting the L_results of the L_massive L_atmospheric and L_oceanic L_modelling L_exercises ; as the L_equilibrium L_models are L_refined to L_take L_account of the L_thermal L_lag in L_oceans , etc. , L_lower L_values of L_predicted L_changes are L_likely ."
b1g-fragment02,916,"L_Thus , while L_almost all L_scientists are — at the L_time of L_writing — L_convinced from the L_evidence that L_change in L_climate is under L_way and that L_regional L_effects may be L_much L_greater than the L_global L_average , the L_magnitude of the L_latter is now L_thought L_likely to be about L_half of what was L_predicted only 5 L_years L_ago ."
b1g-fragment02,917,Who is L_involved and what is L_going on ?
b1g-fragment02,918,"If we L_consider the L_environment in the L_broadest L_sense , L_much L_monitoring of it has been in L_progress for L_many L_years and by an L_enormous L_diversity of L_organizations in the L_UK ; these L_include the L_DoE , the L_Forestry L_Commission , the L_Nature L_Conservancy , the L_Health and L_Safety L_Executive , L_local L_authorities , the L_component L_members of the L_Natural L_Environment L_Research L_Council ( such as the L_Institute of L_Terrestrial L_Ecology and the L_British L_Antarctic L_Survey ) , L_individuals or L_research L_groups in L_academia , the L_CEGB , the L_Friends of the L_Earth , and L_UK L_Centre for L_Economic and L_Environmental L_Development ( L_CEED ) ( 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,919,"The L_diversity of L_monitoring L_organizations L_seems just as L_great in other L_countries ; L_numerous L_multinational L_organizations , both L_quasi-governmental ( e.g. the L_UN L_Environment L_Programme ( L_UNEP ) ) and L_non-governmental ( e.g. the L_International L_Union for the L_Conservation of L_Nature ( L_IUCN ) and the L_International L_Institute for L_Environment and L_Development ( L_IIED ) ) are L_also L_active in the L_field ."
b1g-fragment02,920,"L_Moreover , L_commercial L_monitoring of the L_environment is now L_also L_routine , L_notably to L_predict L_crop L_yields in the L_main L_grain-growing L_areas and L_hence L_facilitate the L_buying of L_futures ."
b1g-fragment02,921,The L_international L_scientific L_involvement
b1g-fragment02,922,L_Scientists have both L_promoted and L_responded to the L_increasing L_interest in the L_environment .
b1g-fragment02,923,"L_Thus , at the L_global L_scale , the L_International L_Council of L_Scientific L_Unions ( L_ICSU ) has L_endorsed the L_setting up of the L_International L_Geosphere L_Biosphere L_Project ( L_IGBP ) to ‘ L_describe and L_understand the L_interactive L_physical , L_chemical and L_biological L_processes that L_regulate the L_total L_Earth L_system , the L_unique L_environment it L_provides for L_life , the L_changes that are L_occurring in that L_system and the L_manner by which these L_changes are L_influenced by L_human L_actions ’ ( L_Report of ad hoc L_Planning L_Group for L_IGBP 1986 , L_quoted in L_IGBP 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,924,"L_Priority in the L_IGBP is L_intended to be L_given to those L_areas which L_deal with L_key L_interactions and L_significant L_changes on the L_time-scales of L_decades to L_centuries , that most L_affect the L_biosphere , that are most L_susceptible to L_human L_perturbations and those that will most L_likely L_lead to a L_practical , L_predictive L_capability for L_global L_change ."
b1g-fragment02,925,This is to be L_put into L_operation by L_concentrating on four L_themes :
b1g-fragment02,926,1 .
b1g-fragment02,927,L_Documenting and L_predicting L_global L_change ;
b1g-fragment02,928,2 .
b1g-fragment02,929,L_Observing and L_improving our L_understanding of L_dominant L_forcing L_functions ;
b1g-fragment02,930,3 .
b1g-fragment02,931,L_Improving our L_understanding of L_interactive L_phenomena in the L_total L_Earth L_system ;
b1g-fragment02,932,4 .
b1g-fragment02,933,L_Assessing those L_effects of L_global L_change which will be L_large L_scale and L_cause L_major L_modifications to both L_renewable and L_non-renewable L_resources .
b1g-fragment02,934,"By 1990 , L_IGBP had L_progressed as L_far as L_defining a L_set of seven L_core L_projects ( L_IGBP 1990 ) L_addressing these four L_themes ."
b1g-fragment02,935,"In L_addition , L_plans for L_regional L_research L_centres and for the L_data and L_information L_systems for L_IGBP ( L_known as L_IGBP-DIS ) had been L_announced ."
b1g-fragment02,936,The L_latter are L_particularly L_relevant to this L_chapter .
b1g-fragment02,937,"L_Based in L_Paris and L_working under L_Professor I. L_Rasool , it is L_intended to L_concentrate on L_managerial and L_policy L_aspects of the L_task in the L_first 2 L_years ( 1990–92 ) but then to L_expand L_considerably L_thereafter ."
b1g-fragment02,938,"L_Tasks L_agreed for the L_IGBP-DIS L_include L_making L_available a ‘ L_directory of L_data L_directories ’ L_modelled on L_NASA 's L_Master L_Directory , L_providing L_data L_sets for L_education and L_training and L_undertaking a L_land L_cover L_pilot L_study ."
b1g-fragment02,939,"Until 1990 , L_remarkably L_little L_interaction had L_taken L_place between the ‘ L_hard L_science ’ and the L_social L_science L_communities on L_global L_monitoring and L_prediction ."
b1g-fragment02,940,"It is L_noteworthy , L_however , that the L_Royal L_Society L_made a L_plea for just this L_type of L_multidisciplinary L_work in its L_submission on L_greenhouse L_gases to the L_House of L_Lords ' L_Select L_Committee on L_Science and L_Technology ( L_Royal L_Society 1989 : 40 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,941,"L_Fortunately , in L_addition to the L_actions of the L_world ‘ L_hard L_science ’ L_community , a L_parallel L_effort is now being L_initiated by L_social L_scientists ( L_Fuchs 1989 ; L_Jacobson and L_Price 1990 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,942,"L_Currently this is L_organized and L_sponsored by the L_International L_Social L_Science L_Council ( L_ISSC ) , the L_UN L_University and the L_International L_Federation of L_Institutes of L_Advanced L_Studies ."
b1g-fragment02,943,Its L_objectives are to :
b1g-fragment02,944,1 .
b1g-fragment02,945,L_Improve L_scientific L_understanding and L_increase L_awareness of the L_complex L_dynamics L_governing L_human L_interaction with the L_total L_Earth L_system ;
b1g-fragment02,946,2 .
b1g-fragment02,947,"L_Study , L_explore and L_anticipate L_social L_change L_affecting the L_global L_environment ;"
b1g-fragment02,948,3 .
b1g-fragment02,949,L_Identify L_broad L_social L_strategies to L_prevent or L_mitigate L_undesirable L_impacts of L_global L_change or to L_adapt to L_changes which are L_unavoidable ;
b1g-fragment02,950,4 .
b1g-fragment02,951,L_Analyse L_policy L_options for L_dealing with L_global L_environmental L_change and L_promoting the L_goal of L_sustainable L_development .
b1g-fragment02,952,"L_Jacobson and L_Price ( 1990 ) L_provide a L_useful L_summary of the L_ways in which L_human L_factors L_contribute to , and are L_affected by , L_likely L_global L_changes ; in L_particular , they L_stress the L_importance of the L_data-handling L_issues and the L_role of L_GIS in L_coping with some of the L_problems of L_data L_integration and L_manipulation ."
b1g-fragment02,953,The L_ISSC L_proposed its own L_work L_programme in the L_Human L_Dimensions of L_Global L_Change in L_late 1990 .
b1g-fragment02,954,"While these L_organizations L_intrinsically have a L_world-wide L_membership and are L_concerned with L_research into L_global L_environmental L_change , L_others L_share the same L_interest but from a more L_restricted L_geographical L_base ."
b1g-fragment02,955,A L_leading L_example of this is the L_European L_Science L_Foundation which has L_sponsored L_research L_programmes in both the L_physical and L_social L_science L_aspects of L_environmental L_change ( L_ESF 1990 ) .
b1g-fragment02,956,L_Governmental and L_political L_involvement
b1g-fragment02,957,"The L_spread of L_environmental L_awareness is L_readily L_demonstrated : in 1972 , 26 L_countries had L_environmental and L_natural L_resource L_management L_agencies whereas , a L_decade L_later the L_number was 144 ( L_WEC 1985 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,958,"In most L_countries , the L_governmental and L_political L_concern with the L_environment has L_come L_somewhat L_later than that of L_scientists or L_concerned L_lay L_people : the L_early L_development of the L_Green L_Party in the L_Federal L_Republic of L_Germany is L_something of an L_exception ."
b1g-fragment02,959,"Such a L_commitment to the L_environment is , L_none the L_less , both L_welcome and L_necessary if L_resources are to be L_made L_available to L_tackle L_existing , L_let L_alone L_forthcoming , L_environmental L_problems ."
b1g-fragment02,960,The ‘ L_conversion ’ of the L_UK L_government has been L_briefly L_described L_earlier ; it is L_manifested in their L_July 1989 L_commitment to L_spend £10m. on L_climate L_change L_research in 1989/90 and the L_confident L_request to them from the L_Advisory L_Board for the L_Research L_Councils ( L_ABRC ) for an L_extra £11m. in 1990 and £13m. in the two L_succeeding L_years for L_additional L_environmental L_research .
b1g-fragment02,961,"L_Perhaps the most L_significant L_development of all , L_however , is the L_increasing L_role of the L_European L_Commission ."
b1g-fragment02,962,"Their L_role in L_bringing L_environmental L_impact L_assessment ( L_EIA ) on to the L_statute L_book is L_well L_known , but the L_Commission has now L_made a L_proposal ( L_CEC 1989 ) for the ‘ L_establishment of the L_European L_Environment L_Agency and the L_European L_Environment L_Monitoring and L_Information L_Network ’ ."
b1g-fragment02,963,"The L_Commission L_argues that there is at L_present no L_monitoring of L_environmental L_quality and L_trends on a L_European L_scale , nor any L_guarantee that the L_results of L_environmental L_monitoring will be L_comparable on a L_Community-wide L_basis ( a L_realization L_brought about through the L_CORINE L_programme L_described L_later ) ."
b1g-fragment02,964,"The L_objectives of the L_new L_agency would be to L_assist the L_Community and the L_Member L_States to L_achieve the L_goals L_set out in the L_Treaty of L_Rome and in L_successive L_environmental L_action L_programmes ; it must L_also , L_however , be L_seen in the L_context of the L_European L_Council 's L_adoption on 2 L_December 1988 of the L_Rhodes L_Declaration on the L_Environment and the L_environment L_chapter in the L_Single L_European L_Act which L_comes into L_effect in 1992 ."
b1g-fragment02,965,The L_detailed L_specific L_roles of ‘ the L_System ’ ( L_comprising both L_agency and L_network ) are L_envisaged as :
b1g-fragment02,966,1 .
b1g-fragment02,967,"To L_provide the L_Community , the L_Member L_States and L_participating L_third L_countries with the L_objective ( L_sic ) L_information L_requested for the L_formulation and L_implementation of L_sound and L_effective L_environmental L_policies ;"
b1g-fragment02,968,2 .
b1g-fragment02,969,"In L_particular , to L_provide L_technical , L_scientific and L_economic L_information L_requested by the L_Commission in its L_tasks of L_identification , L_preparation and L_assessment of the L_implementation and L_results of L_environmental L_action and L_legislation ;"
b1g-fragment02,970,3 .
b1g-fragment02,971,To L_stimulate the L_development and the L_application within the L_agency of L_techniques of L_environmental L_modelling and L_forecasting in L_order that L_adequate L_preventative L_action can be L_taken at the L_appropriate L_time ;
b1g-fragment02,972,4 .
b1g-fragment02,973,"To L_help L_ensure the L_harmonization and L_comparability of L_environmental L_data in the L_Community as L_well as the L_integration of L_European L_environmental L_data into L_international L_environmental L_monitoring L_programmes , such as those L_established within the L_framework of the L_United L_Nations and its L_system of L_agencies ."
b1g-fragment02,974,L_Considerable L_stress is L_laid by the L_Commission on L_collaboration with L_national L_data-gathering L_agencies and with L_states L_adjacent to the L_Community 's L_borders .
b1g-fragment02,975,It is L_envisaged that the L_totality of L_activities will L_extend the L_existing L_State of the L_European L_Environment L_report ( L_CEC 1988 ) through L_addressing the L_issues of the L_quality and L_sensitivity of the L_environment and L_also the L_pressures upon it .
b1g-fragment02,976,"L_Priorities for the L_new L_agency L_include L_study of L_atmospheric L_emissions and L_quality , L_water L_resources and L_quality ( L_including the L_marine L_environment ) , L_soil L_erosion and L_pollution and L_important L_land L_resources , and L_biotopes and L_nature L_conservation ."
b1g-fragment02,977,"At the L_time of L_writing , the L_proposal has been L_approved and L_discussions are in L_progress on the L_location of the L_agency 's L_headquarters ."
b1g-fragment02,978,It L_seems L_certain to have L_major and L_growing L_effects upon L_environmental L_monitoring and L_prediction in L_Europe and on the L_policies of L_component L_governments .
b1g-fragment02,979,"L_Yet this is by no L_means the only L_plan which the L_Community has in L_relation to the L_environment : L_Directorate-General L_XII ( that for L_Science , L_Research and L_Development ) has L_published L_details of an L_extensive R&D L_programme ( L_CEC 1990a ) and the L_Commission as a L_whole ( L_CEC 1990b ) has L_made L_public its L_plans to L_develop L_regular L_official L_statistics of the L_environment ."
b1g-fragment02,980,The L_private L_sector
b1g-fragment02,981,"L_Certain L_aspects of L_environmental L_monitoring have L_long been L_carried out by the L_private L_sector , L_notably that of L_crop L_states on a L_world-wide L_basis ."

b1g-fragment02,983,"L_However , L_significant L_resources are L_also being L_made L_available by the L_private L_sector where there is no L_immediate L_commercial L_gain : L_thus L_IBM L_UK L_Ltd has L_donated £3.5m. of L_computing L_equipment to L_UNEP and L_IBM in L_general is L_actively L_supporting other R&D which can be L_expected to L_facilitate ‘ L_sustainable L_development ’ : L_IBM L_Europe , for L_instance , has L_invested $16m. in its L_Bergen L_scientific L_centre to L_make it the L_focal L_point for the L_company 's L_environmental L_modelling and a L_centre for L_information on the L_environment and L_sustainable L_development ."
b1g-fragment02,984,"On a more L_modest L_basis , L_IBM L_UK have L_agreed to L_fund a L_pilot L_global L_population L_database being L_built in L_Birkbeck L_College to L_permit L_assessment of the L_impact of L_environmental L_change on the L_world s L_population ."
b1g-fragment02,985,"L_Many other L_companies , of L_course , are L_supporting L_environmental L_work but L_IBM L_seems L_almost to be L_unique in its L_corporate L_commitment to L_use of L_high L_technology for L_facilitating ‘ L_sustainable L_development ’ ."

b1g-fragment02,989,An L_example of L_environmental L_modelling and L_prediction where the L_interactions between L_different L_processes and L_dynamic L_feedback is L_taken into L_account is L_given by L_Haber and L_Schaller ( 1988 ) .

b1g-fragment02,1008,"A 4-year L_experimental L_programme to ‘ L_collect , L_co-ordinate and L_ensure the L_consistency of L_information on the L_state of the L_environment and L_natural L_resources in the L_European L_Communities ’ was L_set up and L_labelled L_CORINE ."

b1g-fragment02,1027,The L_global L_scale : L_NASA and GEMS/GRID
b1g-fragment02,1028,"Without L_question , the L_largest ‘ L_player ’ in the L_global L_environment L_arena is L_NASA ."
b1g-fragment02,1029,"The L_organization has L_initiated L_many of the L_schemes which now are under L_discussion — the L_IGBP , for L_instance , has been L_strongly L_influenced by L_NASA L_proposals ."
b1g-fragment02,1030,A L_summary of L_current L_activities and L_future L_plans is L_given in L_NASA ( 1988b ) .

b1g-fragment02,1032,"L_Approved L_future L_programmes L_include the L_Upper L_Atmosphere L_Research L_Satellite , the L_NASA L_Scatterometer and the L_joint NASA/CNES L_Ocean L_Topography L_Experiment ."
b1g-fragment02,1033,"In L_addition , L_however , L_funding has L_recently been L_approved for a L_much more L_ambitious L_scheme — the L_Earth L_Observing L_System ( L_EOS ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1034,This is L_conceived not as a L_set of L_hardware but as a L_comprehensive L_information L_system L_focused on the L_needs L_identified by the L_ESSC ( L_see above ) and L_anticipating L_somewhat those of L_IGBP .
b1g-fragment02,1035,"It will L_collate L_data from the two L_proposed L_space L_station L_polar L_platforms , one L_European L_Space L_Agency L_platform , a L_Japanese one and L_also from the L_manned L_space L_station ."
b1g-fragment02,1036,"On this L_basis , a L_data L_flow of no L_less than 1 L_terabyte ( i.e. 10&sup12 ; L_bytes ) L_day is L_anticipated by the mid-1990s ."
b1g-fragment02,1037,A L_major L_user of L_NASA L_data and L_skills has been the L_UN L_Environment L_Programme .
b1g-fragment02,1038,"L_formed in the L_wake of the 1972 L_Stockholm L_conference , L_UNEP L_soon L_spawned the L_Global L_Environment L_Monitoring L_System ( L_GEMS ) as L_well as an L_international L_register of L_potentially L_toxic L_chemicals and a L_global L_network of L_sources to L_locate and L_provide L_technical , L_scientific and L_management L_information on the L_environment ."
b1g-fragment02,1039,The L_need for a L_mechanism to L_handle the L_global L_environmental L_data was L_defined in the L_early 1980s and the L_Global L_Resources L_Information L_Database ( L_GRID ) L_resulted .

b1g-fragment02,1041,"In L_addition to the L_work being L_carried out in the L_UNEP L_HQ at L_Nairobi and in the GEMS/GRID L_site in L_Geneva , a L_series of L_GRID L_regional L_nodes are now being L_set up L_world-wide , each L_equipped with the same L_hardware and L_software and L_local L_subsets of the L_data ."
b1g-fragment02,1042,The L_first of these is in L_Bangkok and another is to be L_opened in L_Latin L_America .
b1g-fragment02,1043,"L_Moreover , L_national L_nodes are L_also being L_set up ; the L_recent L_IBM L_gift to L_GRID ( L_see above ) has L_ensured that L_powerful L_microcomputers have been L_installed in L_many L_African L_countries , L_together with L_national and L_continental L_data L_sets ."
b1g-fragment02,1044,L_Training of L_unskilled L_staff to L_operate this L_equipment and to L_exploit the L_scientific L_data is now a L_major L_role for L_GRID L_staff .
b1g-fragment02,1045,L_Technical L_aspects and L_problems
b1g-fragment02,1046,It L_follows from L_much of the above that there are L_major L_challenges in L_use of L_environmental L_data .
b1g-fragment02,1047,These are L_best L_considered by L_itemizing L_characteristics of L_contemporary L_environmental L_monitoring and L_prediction :
b1g-fragment02,1048,1 .
b1g-fragment02,1049,"The L_use of L_secondary L_data , L_rather than L_primary L_data L_collected by the L_data L_analyst ;"
b1g-fragment02,1050,2 .
b1g-fragment02,1051,"The L_need , at L_least with L_data on the L_terrestrial L_environment , for an L_inference L_process to L_extract L_useful L_information from the L_secondary ( and L_often L_proxy ) L_data ;"
b1g-fragment02,1052,3 .
b1g-fragment02,1053,The L_data L_volumes L_collected are L_often L_voluminous L_even by the L_standards of L_contemporary L_computing L_facilities ;
b1g-fragment02,1054,4 .
b1g-fragment02,1055,The L_analyses L_carried out are L_often L_arcane in L_detail to all but a L_small L_group of ‘ L_high L_priests ’ ;
b1g-fragment02,1056,5 .
b1g-fragment02,1057,"We have only a L_limited L_capacity for L_checking the L_accuracy of L_many L_environmental L_monitoring L_results , L_let L_alone of L_predictions ."
b1g-fragment02,1058,Some of these L_characteristics are now L_addressed in L_slightly more L_detail ; it will be L_obvious that such L_problems L_merit a L_paper in themselves .
b1g-fragment02,1059,L_Remote L_sensing as a L_data L_collection L_process
b1g-fragment02,1060,"As the L_need for more L_extensive , L_high-resolution L_yet L_consistent and L_up-to-date L_data L_becomes more L_pressing , L_increased L_use of L_remote L_sensing L_seems L_inevitable ."
b1g-fragment02,1061,No other L_data L_collection L_methodology L_obviates the L_short L_distance L_variation in L_data L_sets L_induced by L_variations in L_data L_collection and L_aggregation L_methodology L_typically L_encountered between L_adjacent L_nation L_states .
b1g-fragment02,1062,"The L_problem is now L_recognized , L_especially in L_Europe , and L_strenuous L_efforts are being L_made to L_harmonise the L_data L_sets ( e.g. through the L_use of L_standard L_classifications , such as that for L_land L_use L_produced by the L_Conference of L_European L_Statisticians in 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1063,"At L_present , L_however , L_ground-collected L_environmental L_data are L_far L_less than L_ideal ."
b1g-fragment02,1064,"L_Recognizing this , L_NASA ( 1988a ) L_concluded that L_forthcoming L_global L_science L_projects would L_need L_land L_surface L_altitude L_data at three L_resolutions : 1 L_km L_resolution in L_XY and 10–100 m L_resolution in Z on a L_global L_basis , 100 m L_XY L_resolution and 1–10 m L_resolution in Z for L_regional L_databases and 10 m L_XY L_resolution and 0.1–1 m in Z for L_local L_studies ."
b1g-fragment02,1065,They L_argued that L_existing L_maps and L_digitized L_files from them are L_unable to L_meet these L_needs at L_global or L_regional L_scale and only L_remote L_sensing could L_help in the L_short L_term : the L_availability of L_stereometric L_data from the L_French L_SPOT L_satellite has L_already L_led to L_proposals for L_automated L_creation of L_global L_digital L_elevation L_models with a L_spatial ( L_XY ) L_resolution of about 30 m ( L_Muller 1989 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1066,"For L_many L_terrestrial L_purposes , L_however , a L_substantial L_inference L_process must L_take L_place to L_convert the L_radiometric L_measurements into L_useful L_information ( in L_contrast , more L_direct L_measurements of L_sea L_state , etc. are L_possible ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1067,"The L_value of this L_information is L_inherently L_dependent upon the L_quality of the L_inference L_process and that in L_turn L_depends upon the L_complexity of the L_scene , the L_spatial , L_temporal and L_spectral L_resolution of the L_sensors and the L_particular L_algorithms L_used ."
b1g-fragment02,1068,"L_Thus L_far , for L_instance , L_accuracies of L_land L_cover ( L_let L_alone what is L_often L_needed , i.e. L_land L_use ) L_determined from L_Landsat and L_SPOT L_imagery for the L_UK have L_rarely been L_higher than 70 per L_cent unless L_trivial L_classifications ( e.g. built/unbuilt L_land ) have been L_used ."
b1g-fragment02,1069,"One L_solution to this is to ‘ L_densify ’ the L_ground L_control and another is to L_use L_contextually L_based L_classifiers L_rather than the L_traditional , L_spectrally L_based L_ones ."
b1g-fragment02,1070,"But the L_ground L_conditions in some L_parts of L_Europe L_make L_good L_results L_extremely L_difficult to L_obtain : some L_areas of L_Portugal , for L_instance , have L_field L_sizes of only a few L_metres and L_exhibit L_multi-level and L_multi-seasonal L_cropping ."
b1g-fragment02,1071,A further L_difficulty is the L_cost of the L_data in L_relation to its L_anticipated L_benefits .
b1g-fragment02,1072,L_Relatively few cost/benefit L_studies have L_yet been L_carried out except in such L_areas as L_crop L_prediction and L_ocean L_navigation ( where they are L_generally L_shown to be L_highly L_advantageous in L_saving L_someone L_else 's L_money ) .
b1g-fragment02,1073,It may be that a L_study L_commissioned from L_contractors by the L_British L_National L_Space L_Centre will L_provide L_useful L_evidence on the L_cash L_value of L_remote L_sensing ; it is L_particularly L_timely in L_view of the L_appointment of L_Professor L_Pearce ( L_see above ) as the L_adviser to the L_UK L_Secretary of L_State for the L_Environment .
b1g-fragment02,1074,Other L_work on L_assessment of L_costs and L_benefits of such L_data have been L_carried out for the L_French L_government by L_Professor L_Didier ( 1990 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1075,"L_Finally , since L_data are L_often L_costly to L_acquire , it L_follows that L_summaries of them e.g. The L_State of the L_European L_Environment L_report ( L_CEC 1988 ) and the L_Environmental L_Data L_Report of the L_UN L_EP ( L_GEMS L_MARC 1989 ) are of L_considerable L_value ."
b1g-fragment02,1076,"L_Equally , the ‘ L_signposting ’ L_role now being L_adopted by L_UNEP 's L_GRID L_project — which is L_expected to L_offer L_on-line L_access to a L_catalogue of L_environmental L_data L_sets and L_details of the L_responsible L_agencies in 1991 — is to be L_welcomed ."
b1g-fragment02,1077,The L_data L_problem and L_partial L_solutions
b1g-fragment02,1078,The L_lack of L_harmonization of L_definitions and L_methods of L_collection of L_environmental L_data have L_already been L_outlined above .
b1g-fragment02,1079,"In the L_European L_Community of 12 L_nation L_states , for L_instance , no L_less than eight L_procedures for L_calculating L_potential L_evapo-transpiration have been in L_use !"
b1g-fragment02,1080,"The L_need for L_harmonization is L_obvious and , in this L_respect , must L_follow from the L_successful L_pioneering L_achievements of L_EUROSTAT in L_harmonizing the L_definitions in L_trade , L_demographic and other ‘ L_social L_science ’ L_statistics ( L_see L_CEC 1990b ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1081,An L_additional and L_severe L_problem is that the L_volumes of L_data which are L_already L_collected are L_huge by the L_standards of only a L_decade L_ago .
b1g-fragment02,1082,"By 1995/96 , they will be very L_much L_greater , L_notably from the L_EOS L_programme ."
b1g-fragment02,1083,L_NASA has L_announced L_plans to L_collect up to 1 L_terabyte ( 10&sup12 ; L_bytes ) L_day .
b1g-fragment02,1084,"Since L_remote L_sensing L_data L_sets ( L_especially those L_pertaining to L_terrestrial L_areas of the L_globe ) L_typically L_need L_much L_pre-processing to L_calibrate , L_transform and then L_perform an L_inference L_process and L_hence L_convert L_measurements of the L_radiation L_reflected or L_emitted by L_small L_areas of L_ground into L_useful ( e.g. L_land L_cover ) L_data , the L_processing L_power L_required is L_going to be L_formidable ."
b1g-fragment02,1085,"Other , L_non-remote-sensing L_data L_sets are L_smaller in L_volume but more L_complex in L_structure and in their L_characteristics ."
b1g-fragment02,1086,To L_hold all of the 1/50 000 L_scale L_topographic L_map L_coverage L_alone for the L_European L_Community would L_probably L_require about 3 L_terabytes of L_storage .
b1g-fragment02,1087,"L_Parenthetically , the L_form in which the L_data may be L_held can L_affect L_dramatically the L_scale of the L_problem L_faced ."
b1g-fragment02,1088,"It would be L_technically L_possible , for L_instance , to L_hold in L_less than 1 L_terabyte L_detailed L_information for every L_individual in the L_world , L_akin to that L_collected about L_everyone in the L_UK through the L_Census of L_Population ."
b1g-fragment02,1089,"In L_practice , L_legislation L_generally L_forbids such L_data being L_held L_thus and L_distributed in L_anything other than L_area L_aggregate L_form ; the L_cross-tabulations L_commonly L_employed ( e.g. to L_give L_tables of L_population L_numbers L_broken down by L_age and L_sex ) L_often L_result in a L_great L_multiplication of the L_data L_volumes ."
b1g-fragment02,1090,"This all L_presents L_major L_problems of L_data L_storage , L_handling ( L_especially for L_global L_data L_sets ) , L_display and L_dissemination ."
b1g-fragment02,1091,"L_Fortunately , L_technical L_developments have L_ensured that the L_increase in L_computing L_power per L_unit L_cost has been L_growing at about an L_order of L_magnitude every 6 L_years over the L_last three L_decades ."
b1g-fragment02,1092,"L_Indeed , this may L_grossly L_under-represent the L_present L_situation : the L_rapid L_spread of L_UNIX-based L_systems L_seems to L_facilitate L_competition and , at the L_time of L_writing , L_performance of L_workstations per L_unit L_cost L_seems to be L_increasing at about 50 per L_cent per L_annum ."
b1g-fragment02,1093,"L_Moreover , the L_advent of L_low-cost , L_high-density-storage L_devices like L_CD-ROMs may L_well L_make L_substantial L_data L_sets L_available L_even to those with L_modest L_computing L_power : a L_CD-ROM , for L_instance , can L_hold about 600 L_megabytes ( i.e. 10&sup6 ; L_bytes ) , can be L_reproduced L_currently for about £1 and L_read on a L_device L_costing about £400 ."
b1g-fragment02,1094,"L_Yet , despite such L_revolutionary L_changes in L_technology , L_novel L_solutions will L_still be L_required to L_make L_effective L_use of the L_new L_data L_sets ."
b1g-fragment02,1095,One such L_solution is L_Goodchild and L_Yang 's ( 1989 ) L_scheme for a L_hierarchical L_spatial L_data L_structure to L_handle L_data for the L_spherical L_earth .
b1g-fragment02,1096,A L_particular L_problem is that L_little or no L_quantitative L_regard has been L_paid until L_recently to the L_effects of L_quality L_variation in L_environmental L_data .
b1g-fragment02,1097,The L_literature of the L_last few L_years is L_thronged with L_papers L_proposing that these must be L_taken into L_account — but with few L_realistic L_proposals on how this is to be L_achieved .
b1g-fragment02,1098,L_Goodchild ( 1988 ) has L_made L_perhaps the L_best L_summary of the L_problem and L_possible L_solutions to L_date .
b1g-fragment02,1099,"L_Finally , L_relatively L_little L_emphasis has been L_given to the L_management of L_data as a L_corporate L_resource , L_available to a L_wide L_community : L_many L_environmental L_data are L_collected on a L_project-by-project L_basis and ‘ L_lost ’ once the L_urgency of the L_initial L_research is over ."
b1g-fragment02,1100,"L_However , the 1990 L_report of the L_Data and L_Facilities L_Working L_Group of the L_UK L_Inter-Agency L_Committee on L_Global L_Environmental L_Change L_argued L_strongly that L_planning for the L_dissemination and L_maintenance of such L_data was a L_vital L_role ."
b1g-fragment02,1101,It L_also L_noted that L_ownership of and L_access to L_environmental L_data was a L_policy L_matter of the L_greatest L_importance ; this may be more L_difficult in ‘ within L_country ’ L_data than with L_global L_data since the L_latter are L_often L_already the L_subject of L_international L_exchange L_agreements at zero L_cost .
b1g-fragment02,1102,L_Global L_environmental L_research and the L_social L_sciences
b1g-fragment02,1103,"L_Thus L_far , the L_emphasis has been very L_much on the L_natural L_science L_aspects of L_environmental L_monitoring and L_prediction ."
b1g-fragment02,1104,That is L_unremarkable since the L_anticipation of such L_problems and L_assessments of some of their L_causes and L_magnitudes can only be L_made by L_environmental L_scientists .
b1g-fragment02,1105,"L_Yet the L_consequences of any L_significant L_changes are a L_matter of the L_utmost L_concern to L_planners and to L_politicians at all L_levels , the L_quantification of the L_costs and L_benefits of L_alternative L_policy L_strategies is very L_much a L_matter for L_economists , and the L_adaptation of L_societies to L_massive L_change is a L_particular L_interest to L_sociologists and L_others ."
b1g-fragment02,1106,"For L_geographers — who L_span the L_conventional ( and now L_archaic ) L_dichotomy between the L_natural and the L_environmental L_sciences — all of these L_aspects L_need to be L_woven L_together to L_anticipate the L_likely L_spatial L_patterns of the L_effects of L_massive L_change , the L_redistributions in L_trade , L_health and L_wealth which they will L_bring about and the ‘ L_knock on ’ L_effects these L_consequences themselves will have on L_society and the L_environment ."
b1g-fragment02,1107,"For L_social L_scientists , then , L_environmental L_monitoring and L_prediction are a L_matter of L_considerable L_significance , L_especially as ‘ L_globalization ’ of L_markets and L_economies L_proceeds ."
b1g-fragment02,1108,The L_Economic and L_Social L_Research L_Council ( L_ESRC ) L_commissioned two L_reports on L_global L_environmental L_change to L_guide or at L_least L_inform the L_allocation of L_research L_funding .
b1g-fragment02,1109,These L_reports ( L_Pearce 1990 ; L_Turner 1990 ) may be L_taken as L_informed L_views from at L_least the L_economists in the L_UK L_social L_science L_community on the L_social L_science L_aspects of L_global L_environmental L_change .
b1g-fragment02,1110,"L_Pearce ( 1990 ) , for L_instance , L_presented an L_economist 's L_views of the L_high-priority L_topics for L_research as L_follows :"

b1g-fragment02,1129,10 .
b1g-fragment02,1130,L_Trade and L_global L_change .
b1g-fragment02,1131,L_Turner ( 1990 ) L_argued that the L_priorities are as L_follows :
b1g-fragment02,1132,1 .
b1g-fragment02,1133,The L_socio-economic L_consequences of L_sea-level L_rise ;
b1g-fragment02,1134,2 .
b1g-fragment02,1135,L_Techniques for the L_valuation of L_environmental L_resources and L_effects ;

b1g-fragment02,1141,L_Understanding of how L_environmental L_issues and L_technical L_change L_interact ;
b1g-fragment02,1142,6 .
b1g-fragment02,1143,The L_interrelationship between L_environmental L_ethics and L_economics .
b1g-fragment02,1144,"There is , then , no L_shortage of L_social L_science L_research which is L_claimed to be L_necessary if we are to L_cope with L_environmental L_change ."
b1g-fragment02,1145,Some of it is being L_carried out : in L_March 1991 L_ESRC L_announced a £6m L_programme of L_research on L_Global L_Environmental L_Change .
b1g-fragment02,1146,"L_However , L_perhaps most L_critical of all in the L_early L_stages is L_social L_science L_practice L_rather than L_research ."
b1g-fragment02,1147,"In the L_USA at L_least , there L_needs to be an L_improvement in L_scientists ' L_understandings of how to L_influence the L_allocation of L_funding for L_remedial L_measures or for further L_research ( L_see L_Kitsos and L_Ashe 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1148,"All too L_often , it L_seems that the L_coupling of an as L_yet L_imperfect L_scientific L_understanding to L_policy-making is L_tenuous ( L_see L_Table 9.2 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1149,"L_Fortunately , L_considerable L_high-quality L_work has L_already L_begun on the L_legal , L_political and L_institutional L_aspects of L_global L_environmental L_change ( L_see , for L_instance , L_Nitze 1990 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1150,What L_next ?
b1g-fragment02,1151,The L_contents of this L_chapter have L_scarcely L_touched upon such L_important L_environmental L_research as the L_World L_Ocean L_Climate L_Experiment or the L_World L_Climate L_Research L_Programme .
b1g-fragment02,1152,Nor has there been any L_discussion of the L_growing L_requirement in the L_UK ( as L_elsewhere ) to L_carry out an L_environmental L_impact L_assessment for all L_major L_developments .
b1g-fragment02,1153,The L_consequences for some L_nations or L_subgroups in a L_population of being without L_access to L_environmental L_data or the L_tools for L_analysing them while L_others have such L_access are L_potentially L_profound — as the L_European L_Commission has L_recognized in L_issuing a L_directive on L_public L_access to L_environmental L_data ( L_CEC 1990d ) — yet L_space L_limitations have L_also L_precluded their L_discussion .
b1g-fragment02,1154,"Despite these L_shortcomings L_dictated by the L_space L_available , what has been L_said should be L_sufficient to L_illustrate the L_enormous and L_diverse L_scope of L_environmental L_monitoring and L_prediction ."
b1g-fragment02,1155,Such is its L_diversity that L_measuring the L_total L_expenditure on it L_seems L_quite L_impossible and the L_number of ‘ L_actors ’ L_already L_involved is L_vast .
b1g-fragment02,1156,"What is L_clear , L_however , is that L_monitoring is L_rarely a L_simple L_exercise , that the L_time-scales of the L_sponsors of L_monitoring and L_environmental L_research are L_rarely L_long L_term though most L_science is L_inevitably of this L_nature and that the L_increasingly L_multinational L_nature of such L_work L_necessitates a L_degree of L_management not L_always L_present in L_local or L_nationally L_based L_schemes ."
b1g-fragment02,1157,"In these L_circumstances , it is L_scarcely L_surprising that there is L_evidence of L_international and L_interdisciplinary L_dispute , as L_Terney ( 1989 ) has L_chronicled in L_regard to L_IGBP ."
b1g-fragment02,1158,"L_Moreover , as L_Newby ( 1990 ) has L_pointed out , the L_complexities of L_environmental L_research have L_created a L_new L_kind of L_relationship between L_research and L_policy : ‘ in the L_past , … the L_relationship was L_predicated on the L_belief that L_science L_provided L_decision-makers with L_objective ‘ L_hard ’ L_facts on which to L_base their L_soft , L_value-ridden L_policies … ."
b1g-fragment02,1159,"But now we L_find L_scientists L_delivering only ‘ L_soft ’ , L_uncertain ‘ L_facts ’ to L_decision-makers L_facing ‘ L_hard ’ L_decisions . ’"
b1g-fragment02,1160,"L_Yet , L_even if all of this L_causes L_great L_uncertainty among L_scientists , it is L_still a L_reasonable L_prediction that a L_decade L_ahead will L_see both L_environmental L_monitoring and L_prediction L_treated as an L_everyday L_need and L_activity in L_major L_organizations ."
b1g-fragment02,1161,We shall L_also L_see the L_existence of L_binding L_requirements upon L_national L_governments — L_certainly in the L_European L_Community — to L_collect at L_least L_basic L_environmental L_indicators in a L_harmonized L_form ( L_CEC 1990b ) .
b1g-fragment02,1162,"More than that , it L_seems L_highly L_likely that the L_social L_science L_aspects of L_environmental L_problems will L_underpin the L_actions of L_governments and L_international L_agencies ."
b1g-fragment02,1163,"L_Perhaps the L_single most L_important L_conclusion to be L_drawn from this L_review is that the L_monitoring , L_modelling and L_management of the L_global L_environment are L_tasks which L_uniquely L_require the L_integration of L_skills and L_techniques from L_many L_disciplines ."
b1g-fragment02,1164,L_Building such L_research L_teams is L_essential .
b1g-fragment02,1165,"L_Underlying it all , L_however , is one L_obvious L_fact : that the L_gathering and L_analysis of L_geographically L_distributed L_environmental L_data L_form the L_necessary L_starting-point for L_ensuring the L_success of our L_future on L_earth ."

b1g-fragment02,1171,L_Introduction
b1g-fragment02,1172,"Few L_areas of the L_application of L_GIS L_technology can be as L_socially L_significant , or L_environmentally L_relevant , as the L_management of L_emergencies and L_disasters L_due to L_natural and L_technological L_hazards ."
b1g-fragment02,1173,"Whether L_attempting to L_construct a L_database of L_resources for L_use in L_planning L_responses to L_nuclear L_emergencies , L_developing L_optimal L_routes for L_scheduling the L_safe L_transport of L_hazardous L_substances , or L_monitoring the L_health L_implications of a L_disaster , L_GIS can L_assist in L_identifying L_possibilities and L_formulating L_solutions ."
b1g-fragment02,1174,The 1990s have been L_declared the L_International L_Decade for L_Natural L_Disaster L_Reduction .
b1g-fragment02,1175,"L_Let us L_hope that G1S can , in some L_small L_way , L_help L_mitigate the L_suffering and L_hardship L_felt by all those L_afflicted by the L_effects of L_hazards which , as we have L_learnt with L_bitter L_recent L_experience in the L_UK , can L_occur in an L_untimely L_fashion in the most L_improbable of L_places ."
b1g-fragment02,1176,"L_Research on L_hazards is L_multidisciplinary and L_straddles the L_social , L_environmental and L_mathematical L_sciences ."
b1g-fragment02,1177,"If , for L_instance , we L_wish to L_model the L_dispersal of a L_plume of L_toxic L_gas L_resulting from a L_chemical L_explosion , L_assess its L_possible L_impact on L_human L_health and L_evaluate L_likely L_evacuation L_scenarios of the L_population at L_risk we would L_require , for L_example , a L_knowledge of L_atmospheric L_dispersion L_models , L_epidemiology and L_population L_distribution ."
b1g-fragment02,1178,Some L_researchers L_suggest that L_hazards ( and L_emergencies that might L_result ) can be L_regarded as either L_natural or L_technological .
b1g-fragment02,1179,"We shall L_elaborate on this L_simple L_division below but L_suggest here that the L_wealth of L_literature on the L_former ( L_see , for L_instance , L_Burton et al. 1978 and L_Perry 1981 ) has L_yet to be L_matched by a L_similar L_volume of L_work on the L_latter ."
b1g-fragment02,1180,There are L_signs that this L_imbalance is being L_rectified ( L_Zeigler et al. 1983 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1181,"L_Hazard L_research , like few other L_GIS L_application L_areas , is not only L_stretching the L_present L_technology to its L_limits but is a L_quite L_remarkable L_focus of L_international L_effort into L_several L_important L_research-related L_areas such as L_expert L_systems and L_simulation L_studies ."
b1g-fragment02,1182,"In this L_sense the L_scene is L_clearly one of L_hazard L_problems L_looking for L_improved L_GIS L_rather than for L_GIS L_looking for L_good L_problems , as is all too L_often the L_case ."
b1g-fragment02,1183,L_Hazard L_research
b1g-fragment02,1184,What are L_hazards ?
b1g-fragment02,1185,"L_Formally , a L_hazard can be L_defined as : ‘ a L_physical L_situation with a L_potential for L_human L_injury , L_damage to L_property , L_damage to the L_environment , or some L_combination of these ’ ( L_Health and L_Safety L_Executive 1989 : 30 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1186,"A L_hazard is a L_threat which , L_given a L_set of L_circumstances , may L_become L_translated into a L_realized L_event ."
b1g-fragment02,1187,"What we L_choose to L_call this L_event L_depends upon L_factors such as its L_magnitude : we L_speak for L_instance of L_accidents , L_emergencies , L_disasters and L_catastrophes , each of which L_carries L_connotations L_concerning the L_scale of the L_event and each of which will have a L_set of L_human and/or L_environmental L_consequences ."
b1g-fragment02,1188,"On 30 L_March 1956 one of the most L_powerful L_volcanic L_disturbances this L_century , the L_Bezymianny L_eruption , L_occurred ."
b1g-fragment02,1189,Few L_people L_noticed the L_event as it L_took L_place in an L_uninhabited L_part of L_Kamchatcka and L_caused no L_known L_casualties .
b1g-fragment02,1190,"In L_contrast , the L_extrusion of a L_small L_volume of L_lava from a L_secondary L_cone on the L_slopes of L_Tristan L_da L_Cunha L_became the L_focus of L_global L_interest when , during L_October 1961 , the L_island 's L_lobster L_processing L_plant was L_smothered and the 300 L_people of the L_island 's only L_settlement were L_evacuated to the L_UK ."
b1g-fragment02,1191,These two L_contrasting L_events L_emphasize the L_central L_fact that L_even L_natural L_hazards are not L_defined L_solely by the L_characteristics of the L_event but by the L_interaction of those L_events with the L_human L_occupation of the L_threatened L_area .
b1g-fragment02,1192,"As L_noted above , the L_simple L_division of L_hazards is between those which are L_natural and those which are L_technological or L_human-induced ."
b1g-fragment02,1193,Each of these may be further L_subdivided and the L_typology L_shown in Fig. 10.1 L_draws upon the L_classic L_work of L_Burton and L_Kates ( 1964 ) in L_separating L_geophysical from L_biological L_hazards and L_Zeigler et al. ( 1983 ) in L_distinguishing L_public ( or what we might L_call L_societal ) L_hazards from L_private ( L_individual ) L_ones .
b1g-fragment02,1194,The further L_subdivision of L_natural L_hazards is L_self-explanatory as is that of L_individual L_technological L_hazards .
b1g-fragment02,1195,"L_Zeigler L_divides the L_public L_hazards into those which L_result from the L_production of L_raw L_materials and L_manufactured L_goods , those which L_originate in L_transport and L_transmission and those which L_threaten the L_public in their L_role as L_consumers ."
b1g-fragment02,1196,"The L_United L_Nations L_Disaster L_Relief L_Organization ( L_UNDRO ) has L_produced a L_classification of L_disasters , L_derived on the L_basis of L_case L_data ( L_Table 10.1 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1197,"L_UNDRO L_recognizes three L_basic L_types of L_disaster : L_accidents , L_natural L_events , and other L_disasters ."
b1g-fragment02,1198,The L_differentiation of L_accidents from other L_types is L_useful in the L_context of L_emergency L_planning and is not so L_clearly L_conveyed by other L_hazard L_typologies .
b1g-fragment02,1199,"L_However , the L_temptation in all L_classification L_exercises is to L_produce L_partitional L_schemes and this should L_really be L_resisted here ."
b1g-fragment02,1200,"It is more L_useful ( L_Johnson 1983 ) to L_adopt a L_non-partitional L_scheme ( fig. 10.1 ) that L_recognizes , for L_instance , L_food L_poisoning as both a L_personal and L_consumer L_hazard , or L_lead L_pollution ( e.g. from L_car L_exhausts ) as both a L_meteorological L_event and L_technological L_hazard ( both L_public and L_private ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1201,"An L_air L_crash ( as at L_Lockerbie ) L_affects an L_entire L_community L_directly , as L_well as being an L_occupational L_hazard and L_risk to the L_individual L_traveller ."
b1g-fragment02,1202,L_Hillslope L_failure ( as at L_Aberfan in L_South L_Wales in 1966 ) is a L_geomorphic L_hazard but may L_arise because of L_raw L_material L_extraction .
b1g-fragment02,1203,L_Dutch L_elm L_disease is a L_floral L_hazard but is L_exacerbated by the L_transport of L_infected L_logs .
b1g-fragment02,1204,L_Hohensemer L_et al. ( 1983 ) L_make the L_important L_point that L_hazards are L_multidimensional in L_nature and L_suggest 12 L_dimensions along which any L_hazard may be L_scored ( L_see L_Table 10.2 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1205,"These L_factors will , of L_course , be L_important in L_deciding on the L_role that L_GIS can L_play in L_hazard L_monitoring and L_emergency L_planning ."
b1g-fragment02,1206,"For L_instance , some L_events will L_persist L_briefly , have L_immediate L_consequences , L_minor L_transgenerational L_effects and have L_little or no L_potential for L_non-human L_mortality ( an L_air L_crash is an L_example ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1207,"L_Others , such as a L_chemical L_explosion L_involving the L_release of a L_toxic L_gas , may L_persist for a L_week or more , have L_delayed L_consequences , may L_affect a L_future L_generation if the L_toxic L_chemical is L_mutagenic and may have a L_significant L_impact on L_plant and L_animal L_populations ."
b1g-fragment02,1208,There may be more L_scope for a L_GIS L_approach in the L_latter than in the L_former L_situations .
b1g-fragment02,1209,"The L_Hohensemer L_scheme is not , L_however , beyond L_criticism ."
b1g-fragment02,1210,"for L_example , can L_hazards L_really be L_thought of as having any L_intentionality ?"
b1g-fragment02,1211,L_Industrial L_hazards and L_risk L_assessment
b1g-fragment02,1212,Once L_hazards have been L_identified there may L_follow L_efforts to L_assess the L_hazard L_risk .
b1g-fragment02,1213,By ‘ L_risk ’ we L_understand ‘ the L_likelihood of a L_specified L_undesired L_event L_occurring within a L_specified L_period or in L_specified L_circumstances ’ ( L_Health and L_Safety L_Executive 1989 : 30 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1214,"It may , of L_course , be L_easier to L_quantify L_risk for L_natural L_hazards because of L_historical L_records and L_statistical L_estimation of L_recurrence L_intervals ."
b1g-fragment02,1215,"L_Technological L_hazards are more L_unpredictable and may be L_extremely L_rare , so that it L_becomes L_difficult to L_use L_probability L_concepts to L_quantify L_risk , L_especially those which L_rely on L_notions of L_relative L_frequency ."
b1g-fragment02,1216,"The L_identification of L_chemical L_hazards L_requires that the L_locations of L_sites be L_known , L_together with the L_dangerous L_substances L_stored or L_processed there ."
b1g-fragment02,1217,In the L_UK ( L_see L_Petts 1988 for a L_splendid L_overview ) the L_Health and L_Safety L_Executive must be L_notified of L_sites where L_hazardous L_substances in L_excess of L_threshold L_limits are L_handled .
b1g-fragment02,1218,"Such L_substances and L_thresholds L_include , for L_instance , 25 L_tonnes of L_flammable L_liquid L_petroleum L_gas and the L_explosive L_sodium L_chlorate , and 10 L_tonnes of L_toxic L_chlorine L_gas ."
b1g-fragment02,1219,"Some 1600 L_installations are L_notifiable , along with L_thousands of L_kilometres of L_pipelines ( L_mostly L_high-pressure L_natural L_gas L_transmission L_lines ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1220,"L_Following a L_number of L_major L_accidents L_involving L_industrial L_activities ( L_including those at L_Flixborough , L_Humberside in 1974 ; L_Beek , the L_Netherlands in 1975 ; and L_Seveso and L_Manfredonia in L_Italy in 1976 ) , the L_EC L_issued a L_Directive on L_Major L_Accident L_Hazards ."
b1g-fragment02,1221,"The L_Directive , which is L_commonly L_referred to as the ‘ L_Seveso ’ L_Directive , was L_issued in L_June 1982 and in the L_UK its L_requirements were L_embodied in the L_Control of L_Major L_Accident L_Hazard ( L_CIMAH ) L_Regulations ( 1984 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1222,"Among other L_things , these L_regulations L_require L_operators of L_hazardous L_installations to L_draw up L_on-site and L_off-site L_emergency L_plans and to L_give L_information to L_members of the L_public who L_live or L_work near such L_installations ( L_Houston 1987 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1223,There are L_presently about 300 L_CIMAH L_sites .
b1g-fragment02,1224,"L_However , L_many L_potentially L_hazardous L_chemical L_installations are not L_covered by such L_regulations ."
b1g-fragment02,1225,"L_Clearly , a L_plant which L_stores 1 L_tonne L_less than is L_required for L_notification L_slips through the L_net , while L_large L_numbers of L_handling L_sites ( L_warehouses , for L_instance ) are not L_covered ."
b1g-fragment02,1226,"The L_regulations have L_obvious L_implications for G1S L_work , as L_illustrated below ."
b1g-fragment02,1227,"In L_Halton L_Borough , L_Cheshire , for L_instance , there are 13 L_notifiable L_installations , with over 20 000 L_people L_living within the L_defined ‘ L_consultation L_zones ’ ( L_Petts 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1228,It is L_also L_relevant to L_point out here the L_work of the L_Health and L_Safety L_Executive in L_developing L_techniques for L_quantitative L_risk L_assessment ( L_Health and L_Safety L_Executive 1989 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1229,"Such L_techniques L_include the L_use of a ‘ L_risk L_assessment L_tool ’ ( L_RISKAT ) , L_inputs to which L_include L_data on L_wind L_direction and L_speed ; the L_output of which is a L_map of L_calculated L_risk L_contours ."
b1g-fragment02,1230,In L_societal L_risk L_assessment ‘ it is L_also L_necessary to L_input L_data on the L_distribution of L_population around the L_installation .
b1g-fragment02,1231,"This can be a L_difficult and L_time-consuming L_process , and L_inevitably some L_simplifying L_assumptions are L_needed ’ ( L_Health and L_Safety L_Executive 1989 : 17 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1232,"Again , the G1S L_implications are L_clear and are L_discussed below ."
b1g-fragment02,1233,L_Hazardous L_waste L_disposal
b1g-fragment02,1234,The L_disposal of both L_nuclear and L_non-nuclear L_wastes has L_proved to be of L_major L_public L_concern in L_recent L_years .
b1g-fragment02,1235,"The L_rather L_clumsy L_handling by L_NIREX of the L_search for L_sites to L_store L_low- and L_intermediate-level L_wastes , L_together with very L_recent L_worries about the L_import of L_toxic L_wastes such as L_polychlorinated L_biphenyls ( L_PCBs ) , are but two L_examples of such L_concern in the L_UK ."
b1g-fragment02,1236,"L_However , while the L_former has been L_given L_considerable L_attention by L_geographers ( L_summarized by L_Openshaw L_et al. 1989 ) there has been L_relatively L_little such L_work in the L_UK on the L_disposal of L_non-nuclear L_wastes ."
b1g-fragment02,1237,"This L_contrasts with the L_situation in the L_USA ( L_Greenberg and L_Anderson 1984 ) , where the L_clean-up of L_abandoned L_sites is a L_priority ."
b1g-fragment02,1238,"L_Certainly , in L_terms of the L_volume of L_waste L_generated in the L_UK L_non-nuclear L_hazardous L_industrial L_wastes should be L_high on the L_environmental L_agenda ; while L_less than 1 million L_tonnes of all L_nuclear L_wastes were L_generated in 1985–86 , 10 L_times that L_amount were L_generated of L_hazardous L_wastes ( L_Openshaw et al. 1989 : 13 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1239,L_Attention should be L_drawn to the three L_Annual L_Reports of the L_Hazardous L_Waste L_Inspectorate ( now L_merged with other L_branches of the L_DoE to L_form Her L_Majesty 's L_Inspectorate of L_Pollution ) .
b1g-fragment02,1240,"These L_contain some L_valuable L_material on L_disposal L_practices , and L_volumes of L_waste L_generated and L_disposed of by each L_waste L_regulation L_authority ( L_WRA ) — L_counties in L_England , L_districts in L_Wales , L_Scotland and L_Northern L_Ireland ."
b1g-fragment02,1241,Each L_WRA is L_required to L_produce a L_waste L_disposal L_plan and these are L_starting to L_appear .
b1g-fragment02,1242,"They too L_contain L_useful L_material on , for L_instance , the L_locations of L_sites , though L_individual L_site L_licences must be L_consulted for L_details of what each is L_permitted to L_take in the L_way of L_hazardous L_wastes ."
b1g-fragment02,1243,"What is not L_known is L_information on the L_locations of L_former L_sites , at which L_quite L_toxic L_materials may have been L_dumped , though L_recent L_work by L_Egger ( 1989 ) in L_Austria has L_mapped a L_vast L_number of such L_sites ."
b1g-fragment02,1244,"It is these , L_rather than L_existing , L_licensed L_sites which should be a L_focus of L_research L_activity , L_particularly when L_examining L_possible L_links to L_ill L_health ."
b1g-fragment02,1245,"We L_simply do not have L_enough L_evidence L_yet to L_back up the L_claim that ‘ L_people are L_almost L_certainly L_ill , L_dead , or L_dying because of these L_sloppy L_waste L_disposal L_activities ’ ( L_Openshaw et al. 1989 : 12 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1246,"L_Research is in L_progress , L_however , to L_assess L_possible L_health L_effects of L_poor L_incineration ( L_Diggle L_et al. 1990 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1247,"L_Particular L_attention should be L_focused on L_hospital L_incinerators , since these have been L_subject to L_Crown L_immunity for L_many L_years and most are L_technically L_ill-equipped to L_burn at L_sufficiently L_high L_temperatures for L_adequate L_disposal of L_wastes ( L_Gatrell and L_Lovett 1991 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1248,"We L_need to L_produce an L_inventory of all such L_sites , L_together with a L_publicly L_available , L_comprehensive L_database on all L_sites L_accepting L_hazardous L_industrial L_wastes ."
b1g-fragment02,1249,L_Emergency L_planning
b1g-fragment02,1250,It is L_convenient to L_retain the nuclear/non-nuclear L_distinction when L_discussing the L_background to L_emergency L_planning .
b1g-fragment02,1251,L_Nuclear L_emergency L_planning in the L_UK has been L_reviewed by L_Matthews and L_Pepper ( 1981 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1252,L_Nuclear L_power L_stations must L_prepare a L_plan and L_submit this to the L_Nuclear L_Installations L_Inspectorate and L_Health and L_Safety L_Executive for L_approval .
b1g-fragment02,1253,L_Evacuation L_plans are L_required to L_cover an L_area within a L_distance of 2.4 L_km ; these L_detail the L_roles to be L_played by the L_emergency L_services .
b1g-fragment02,1254,"The very L_narrow L_emergency L_planning L_zones L_contrast with those in the L_USA ( L_Collins 1981 ) , where L_planning is L_required up to 16 L_km from the L_site to L_cover L_exposure to L_radiation L_plumes ."
b1g-fragment02,1255,"L_Local L_authorities in the L_UK that have L_declared themselves ‘ L_nuclear-free ’ have been L_highly L_critical of L_British L_planning , L_calling for an L_extension of L_emergency L_zones to at L_least 24 L_km ."
b1g-fragment02,1256,L_Zeigler L_et al. ( 1983 ) should be L_consulted for L_material L_relating to L_evacuation L_behaviour in the L_wake of the L_incident at L_Three L_Mile L_Island .
b1g-fragment02,1257,"In the L_UK L_little L_work of any L_description L_seems to have been done on L_human L_behaviour in the L_aftermath of L_releases of L_hazardous L_substances , nor is L_much L_available on L_public L_attitudes to L_emergency L_planning ."
b1g-fragment02,1258,"L_Indeed , no L_major L_studies of L_evacuation L_due to L_hazards have been L_undertaken in L_recent L_times and this is a L_widely L_recognized L_deficiency which no L_research L_funding L_body L_seems L_willing to L_rectify ."
b1g-fragment02,1259,"In the L_USA on the other L_hand , a L_good L_deal of L_useful L_research in these L_areas has been L_undertaken ."
b1g-fragment02,1260,"This L_research is L_brought L_together in very L_useful L_reports L_produced by the L_Oak L_Ridge L_National L_Laboratory , L_Tennessee ( L_Sorenson et al. 1987 ; L_Vogt and L_Sorenson 1987 ) and the L_Disaster L_Research L_Centre , L_University of L_Delaware ."
b1g-fragment02,1261,"L_Perry ( 1985 ) has L_written an L_interesting L_book on L_emergency L_planning and L_evacuation , L_covering both L_natural and L_technological L_hazards ."
b1g-fragment02,1262,"For him , L_comprehensive L_emergency L_planning and L_management L_involve : L_prevention , L_protection , L_response and L_restoration ."
b1g-fragment02,1263,"By L_prevention we L_understand the L_elimination or L_reduction in L_risk , L_perhaps by L_adequate L_zoning or L_safe L_routeing of L_shipments , for L_instance ."
b1g-fragment02,1264,L_Included in L_protection are L_methods for L_detecting L_likely L_hazard L_events and in L_warning those L_likely to be L_affected .
b1g-fragment02,1265,"L_Response L_includes L_search and L_rescue ( L_including the L_need to L_cope with L_secondary L_threats such as L_contamination of L_water L_supplies after an L_explosion , or L_fire L_following an L_earthquake ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1266,"As L_Perry and L_others have L_noted , L_relatively few L_resources are L_devoted to the L_first two L_aspects , the L_bulk L_going to L_response and L_restoration ( L_rebuilding ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1267,It should be L_clear from this L_brief L_description that these L_issues are L_inherently L_geographical .
b1g-fragment02,1268,In one of the few L_studies of L_evacuation L_behaviour after a L_non-nuclear L_hazard L_event L_Liverman and L_Wilson ( 1981 ) L_give L_weight to this L_argument .
b1g-fragment02,1269,"In 1979 a L_train L_carrying L_chlorine , L_liquid L_petroleum , L_toluene and L_propane was L_derailed in L_Mississauga , L_Ontario , L_causing a L_series of L_explosions ."
b1g-fragment02,1270,"This L_led to the L_evacuation of 250 000 L_people which , although L_staggered over L_several L_days , L_led to L_great L_pressure on L_transport L_arteries ."
b1g-fragment02,1271,"An L_important L_finding was that L_many L_relied on their own L_transport and L_went to L_stay with L_friends and L_relatives some L_distance L_away , L_rather than L_relying on the 19 L_official L_evacuation L_reception L_centres ."
b1g-fragment02,1272,"Despite this , the L_evacuation was L_successful , L_partly because the L_accident L_occurred at a L_weekend and the L_immediately L_affected L_area was L_sparsely L_populated ."
b1g-fragment02,1273,"In L_addition , the L_police were L_well L_prepared , L_stimulated L_largely by L_implementing a L_plan L_designed more to L_cope with an L_emergency at the L_nearby L_Toronto L_International L_Airport than for the L_event in L_question ."
b1g-fragment02,1274,"It is not without L_interest to L_note that in the L_USA there is a L_Federal L_Emergency L_Management L_Agency ( L_FEMA ) , L_established in 1978 , L_charged with L_dealing with all L_types of L_emergency L_planning and L_management ."
b1g-fragment02,1275,"In the L_UK there is no L_equivalent , though the L_spate of L_disasters in the L_past 4 L_years ( L_involving over 1000 L_lives L_lost ) has L_led to L_several L_calls for such a L_national L_body to be L_established ."
b1g-fragment02,1276,L_Natural L_hazards
b1g-fragment02,1277,In this L_short L_space it is not L_possible to L_go into any L_depth on the L_nature of L_particular L_natural L_hazards but only to L_highlight those L_aspects L_relevant to L_GIS .
b1g-fragment02,1278,"L_Needless to L_say , the L_study of L_natural L_hazards is L_important , a L_statement L_brought into L_sharp L_focus by the L_fact that L_natural L_hazards L_account for up to 4 per L_cent of L_total L_deaths in the L_world each L_year ( L_Mitchell , 1974 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1279,"In 1970 , for L_example , more than 200 000 L_people L_died in the L_cyclone and L_flooding of L_Bangladesh and in 1979 the L_hurricanes L_David and L_Frederick L_caused more than $3bn L_damage in the L_USA ."
b1g-fragment02,1280,L_Shah ( 1983 ) L_made a L_comprehensive L_investigation of L_natural L_disaster L_reports for the L_period 1974–80 and L_concluded that both L_disaster L_frequency and L_magnitude ( L_measured in L_terms of L_lives L_lost ) are L_increasing .
b1g-fragment02,1281,"L_High L_death L_tolls are L_still a L_characteristic of L_less L_developed , L_low-income L_countries ."
b1g-fragment02,1282,"L_Surprisingly , L_fog is the L_third most L_important L_hazard in L_Europe after L_floods and L_volcanoes ."
b1g-fragment02,1283,L_Research on L_natural L_hazards has a L_long L_tradition in L_geography L_going L_back more than half a L_century .
b1g-fragment02,1284,L_Much of the L_impetus for such L_research L_arose in the L_USA from L_observations on L_river L_basin L_management and the L_need to L_reduce L_flood L_damage .
b1g-fragment02,1285,The L_vast L_majority of L_natural L_hazards L_studies have L_ignored the L_physical L_nature of the L_events per se and have L_concentrated on L_behavioural L_issues such as the L_perception and L_estimation of L_hazards .
b1g-fragment02,1286,"This L_emphasis is L_partly L_due to the L_background of the L_researchers L_involved ( L_many are L_human L_geographers and L_sociologists ) and L_partly because it is only L_really since the L_Second L_World L_War that L_major L_hazards have been L_monitored L_systematically , L_culminating , of L_course , in the L_last L_decade or so in the L_use of L_satellite L_technology ."
b1g-fragment02,1287,"L_Brief L_reference to two L_examples of L_natural L_hazards may L_illustrate the L_potential L_relevance of a L_GIS L_approach , L_applications of which are L_considered below ."
b1g-fragment02,1288,L_Jones et al. ( 1989 ) have L_examined the L_distribution of some 8500 L_landslides in the L_UK .
b1g-fragment02,1289,Their L_maps L_show L_clearly an L_increased L_propensity for L_landsliding in the L_north and L_west of the L_UK .
b1g-fragment02,1290,"More to the L_point , L_however , is the L_fact that this L_distribution can be L_modelled in L_terms of L_slopes , L_rainfall , L_rock L_types and so on ."
b1g-fragment02,1291,In other L_words the L_actual L_hazard L_distribution can be L_understood and L_areas at L_risk L_identified .
b1g-fragment02,1292,"The L_potential L_benefits to L_insurance L_companies , L_engineers and L_planners are L_clear ."
b1g-fragment02,1293,"L_Second , a L_well-known L_winter L_hazard in the L_UK , with L_marked L_spatial L_localization , is L_fog ."
b1g-fragment02,1294,L_Predictive L_models of its L_distribution have L_clear L_implications for L_road and L_air L_safety .
b1g-fragment02,1295,"L_Perry ( 1981 ) L_describes a L_fog L_potential L_index that is a L_function of L_local L_topography , L_environmental L_features L_affecting L_fog L_formation and L_distance from L_standing L_water L_bodies ."
b1g-fragment02,1296,"L_Reliance is L_currently L_placed on a L_network of L_monitoring L_stations , L_often L_sparsely L_located and L_frequently outside L_fog-prone L_areas ; L_GIS could L_implement a L_predictive L_model L_based on L_digitized L_map L_features and L_indeed the L_model could L_also be L_used in L_site L_allocation L_studies for L_airports and the L_like ."
b1g-fragment02,1297,The L_majority of L_natural L_hazard L_research has L_focused on L_single L_hazards but of L_course any L_area may be L_prone to more than one L_hazard L_type .
b1g-fragment02,1298,This L_idea L_led L_Hewitt and L_Burton ( 1971 ) to L_develop the L_concept of ‘ L_all-hazards-at-a-place ’ .
b1g-fragment02,1299,To L_achieve this they L_concentrated on the M_whole L_spectrum of L_damaging L_events in an L_area and L_explored their L_aggregate L_impact .
b1g-fragment02,1300,The L_implications for L_GIS in the L_development of ‘ L_hazardousness ’ L_indices are L_obvious and if L_time-series L_data are L_available there is the L_potential to L_produce a L_variety of L_probability L_maps .
b1g-fragment02,1301,The L_collection of L_historical L_data on L_natural L_hazards is L_important since it is L_clear that their L_spatial L_pattern L_varies through L_time .
b1g-fragment02,1302,L_Many L_areas that L_appear to be L_hazard-free on L_current L_maps may L_merely by L_passing through a L_temporary L_period of L_quiescence .
b1g-fragment02,1303,This is L_perhaps L_best L_illustrated with L_reference to L_earthquakes .
b1g-fragment02,1304,"For L_example , in 1692 , the L_whole of L_southern L_England was L_affected by an L_earthquake whose L_epicentre was L_located in what is now L_Belgium ; a L_good L_deal of L_minor L_structural L_damage was L_inflicted ( L_Morse 1983 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1305,L_Presumably the L_builders of the L_Channel L_Tunnel are L_aware of this ?
b1g-fragment02,1306,L_Environmental L_epidemiology
b1g-fragment02,1307,"This is , of L_course , a L_vast L_subject L_area , L_embracing the L_impact of the L_natural and L_technological L_environments on L_human L_health ."
b1g-fragment02,1308,"It L_covers , for L_instance , the L_associations between L_water and L_air L_pollution and L_ill L_health , L_links between L_geological and L_pedological L_environments and L_ill L_health , as L_well as L_associations between L_specific L_technological L_hazards ( e.g. L_high-voltage L_power L_lines ) and L_possible L_health L_effects ."
b1g-fragment02,1309,"We can only L_consider a L_small L_fraction of this L_work here ; L_little L_consideration is L_given to L_occupational L_environments , for L_instance ."
b1g-fragment02,1310,"In the L_UK such L_research is L_widespread though there are L_specialist L_environmental L_epidemiology L_research L_institutes at L_Southampton and L_Cardiff ( L_funded by the L_Medical L_Research L_Council ) , and L_others at the L_University of L_Surrey ( L_Robens L_Institute ) and at the L_London L_School for L_Hygiene and L_Tropical L_Medicine ."
b1g-fragment02,1311,"The L_latter L_houses the L_Small L_Area L_Health L_Statistics L_Research L_Unit ( L_SAHSRU ) , which has a L_specific L_remit to L_conduct L_research into L_morbidity and L_mortality at L_local L_scales ( L_Elliot 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1312,The L_SAHSRU L_liaises L_closely with L_OPCS .
b1g-fragment02,1313,The L_kinds of L_databases L_used by these L_groups are L_discussed below .
b1g-fragment02,1314,L_Greenberg ( 1983 ) and a L_collection of L_papers in L_Greenberg ( 1987 ) L_review some of the L_literature on L_environmental L_epidemiology .
b1g-fragment02,1315,It L_seems L_worth L_stating at the L_outset that there are two L_ways L_geographical L_research in this L_general L_area can L_proceed .
b1g-fragment02,1316,"One is to L_collect L_morbidity and L_mortality L_data ( L_usually the L_latter is more L_widely L_available , though the L_former more L_useful ) and to L_examine L_spatial L_distributions for L_clustering ."
b1g-fragment02,1317,This has itself L_generated a L_substantial L_literature ( L_see the L_papers in L_Elliot 1988 for an L_overview ) and is L_nowhere L_better L_exemplified than in L_Openshaw 's L_geographical L_analysis L_machine ( L_see Ch. 2 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1318,We then L_search L_retrospectively for L_evidence of L_possible L_environmental L_associations .
b1g-fragment02,1319,An L_alternative L_approach is to L_begin by L_hypothesizing an L_environmental L_determinant of L_ill L_health and to L_collect L_data to L_test an L_explicit L_hypothesis .
b1g-fragment02,1320,If an L_association is L_suggested then we would L_want to L_collect L_data in other L_areas to L_assess the L_hypothesis further .
b1g-fragment02,1321,"Of L_course , these two L_approaches are not L_clear-cut in L_practice ; in L_many L_cases the L_hypotheses of L_interest will have themselves been L_generated by L_inductive L_mapping ."
b1g-fragment02,1322,One L_example of an L_hypothesis which has been L_given L_serious L_attention in L_recent L_years is the L_possible L_link between L_electromagnetic L_fields L_generated by L_high-voltage L_power L_lines or L_supply L_cables and L_ill L_health .
b1g-fragment02,1323,"Some L_work ( L_Perry et al. 1981 ) L_suggested L_associations with L_mental L_illness and L_suicide , while L_others ( e.g. L_Wertheimer and L_Leeper 1982 ) have L_examined L_links to L_various L_cancers , L_including L_leukaemias ."
b1g-fragment02,1324,A L_good L_bibliography is L_provided in L_Perry and L_Pearl ( 1988 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1325,"The L_Central L_Electricity L_Generating L_Board ( now L_privatized and L_split into two L_companies ) is L_funding a L_large-scale , 2-year L_project to L_assess L_links to L_childhood L_cancer , while another L_recently L_announced L_study L_aims to L_look at L_links to L_sudden L_infant L_death ."
b1g-fragment02,1326,"One L_obvious L_problem , with L_implications for any L_GIS L_input , is that the L_effects are L_highly L_localized , with L_little L_measurable L_field L_effect more than a few L_dozen L_metres L_away from the L_route L_centre-lines ."
b1g-fragment02,1327,L_Accuracy of L_digital L_data L_collection ( either of the L_power L_lines or L_residential L_locations ) is L_paramount .
b1g-fragment02,1328,There L_seems to be a L_growing L_interest in L_examining L_associations between L_ill L_health and the L_geological L_environment .
b1g-fragment02,1329,"L_GIS L_work in this L_field ( e.g. L_Matthews 1989 ) is L_reviewed L_later , but we L_note here the L_work of the L_applied L_geochemistry L_group at L_Imperial L_College ( L_responsible for a L_series of L_atlases on L_regional L_geochemistry ) and the L_existence of a L_Society for L_Environmental L_Geochemistry and L_Health ."
b1g-fragment02,1330,One L_area of L_recent L_debate L_concerns L_radon L_gas and its L_links to L_lung L_cancer .
b1g-fragment02,1331,"This is L_taken very L_seriously in the L_USA , where the L_Environmental L_Protection L_Agency L_estimates that 10 000–20 000 L_deaths from L_lung L_cancer each L_year are L_due to L_radon L_gas L_exposure ."
b1g-fragment02,1332,L_Estimates from L_Scandinavia L_suggest that 10–30 per L_cent of such L_deaths are L_caused by L_exposure to L_radon ( L_Richardson 1988 : 270–81 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1333,The L_gas is L_trapped in L_well-insulated L_houses and is L_produced by the L_decay of L_uranium in L_rocks and L_soil ; L_thus it has been L_measured at L_high L_concentrations in L_parts of L_Cornwall and L_Devon .
b1g-fragment02,1334,"There are L_great L_difficulties in L_assessing L_health L_effects , L_however , since L_exposure L_varies L_greatly from L_house to L_house within L_small L_neighbourhoods ."
b1g-fragment02,1335,L_Carefully L_designed L_case-control L_studies are L_therefore L_required to L_measure the L_separate L_effect of L_radon L_exposure after L_controlling for L_smoking L_behaviour and other L_risk L_factors .

b1g-fragment02,1440,This L_module has been L_developed L_using L_IBM 's L_Graphics L_Kernel L_System and L_provides a L_number of L_display L_screens .
b1g-fragment02,1441,"The most L_interesting are those which L_portray L_population L_flows as L_scaled L_ribbons on the L_network L_diagram , and L_evacuation L_shelter L_capacities as L_bar L_diagrams ."
b1g-fragment02,1442,The L_diagrams are L_updated L_periodically during the L_course of the L_simulation .
b1g-fragment02,1443,"In L_dry L_parts of the L_world , such as L_Australia , L_forest and L_bush L_fires are an L_important L_natural L_hazard and some L_attention has been L_given to the L_ways in which L_GIS might L_help L_examine their L_potential L_impacts ."
b1g-fragment02,1444,"L_Kessell ( 1988 ) L_describes a L_PC-based L_GIS L_called L_PREPLAN ( L_PRistine L_Environment L_Planning L_LANguage ) which is a L_natural L_area L_management , L_land-use L_planning and L_fire L_modelling L_system L_developed for the L_Australian L_National L_Parks and L_Wildlife L_Service , L_PREPLAN L_comprises four L_modules : a L_simple L_raster-based L_GIS ; a L_grid L_cell L_resource L_database ; a L_wide L_range of L_vegetation , L_fuel , L_fire L_behaviour , L_erosion and L_land-use L_models ; L_tabular , L_statistical and L_colour L_graphics L_output L_system ."
b1g-fragment02,1445,"With this L_system L_real-time L_fire L_growth can be L_modelled , L_taking into L_account L_changes in L_terrain , L_fuel and L_temporal L_changes in the L_weather ."
b1g-fragment02,1446,"L_Kessell L_points out that L_uncontrollable L_fires are L_recurrent L_phenomena in L_many L_parts of L_Australia , L_causing L_damage in the L_hundreds of L_millions of L_dollars and L_significant L_loss of L_life ."
b1g-fragment02,1447,L_Systems such as L_PREPLAN can L_provide the L_user with L_sound L_models of the L_behaviour L_patterns of L_fire and are L_therefore of L_enormous L_value in L_land-use L_planning .
b1g-fragment02,1448,"One of the most L_widespread L_natural L_hazards is L_flooding , and the L_potential for L_loss of L_property , L_risk to L_life and L_general L_social L_disruption is L_large ."
b1g-fragment02,1449,"One L_interesting L_example of a L_GIS L_approach to L_flood L_damage L_estimation is the L_ANUFLOOD L_package which was L_developed in the L_early 1980s L_following L_detailed L_flood L_damage L_studies for L_flood-prone L_coastal L_towns in L_northern L_New L_South L_Wales , L_Australia ( L_Smith and L_Greenaway , 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1450,"The L_ANUFLOOD L_system L_requires L_locational and L_building L_type L_data on L_individual L_properties , L_stage-damage L_curves L_relating the L_average L_damage that would L_result from L_overfloor L_flooding to L_differing L_depths for each L_property L_type , and L_lastly , L_flood L_frequency in L_terms of L_flood L_height L_expressed as a L_probability ."
b1g-fragment02,1451,L_Output from the L_system is both L_tabular and L_graphical .
b1g-fragment02,1452,Of L_particular L_interest is the L_construction of L_maps L_showing the L_expected L_annual L_amounts of L_damage for L_gridded L_flood-prone L_areas .
b1g-fragment02,1453,"L_ANUFLOOD L_also L_contains L_modules which L_permit the L_investigation of L_various L_flood L_damage L_mitigation L_options , such as L_property L_height L_raising , L_levee L_construction and L_flood L_proofing ."
b1g-fragment02,1454,L_Environmental L_epidemiology
b1g-fragment02,1455,"The L_possibilities L_sketched above L_relate to L_emergency L_planning , the L_search for L_hazardous L_sites , and L_risk L_assessment ."
b1g-fragment02,1456,To what L_extent can L_GIS L_help if an L_event L_occurs ?
b1g-fragment02,1457,"What , for L_instance , of the L_health L_consequences ?"
b1g-fragment02,1458,There is a L_rich L_tradition of L_epidemiological L_work in L_geography and with the L_increasing L_availability of L_spatially L_referenced L_medical L_data the L_scope for L_GIS L_applications is L_wide ( L_Gatrell 1987 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1459,"For L_instance , L_Diggle L_et al. ( 1990 ) L_assess the L_hypothesis that L_cancer of the L_larynx is L_associated with L_proximity to a L_now-closed L_incinerator and L_develop a L_statistical L_model from the L_theory of L_spatial L_point L_processes to L_test this ."
b1g-fragment02,1460,This would have been L_impossible without the L_link L_provided from L_postcoded L_data ( L_increasingly L_available from L_sources such as L_cancer L_registries ) to L_Ordnance L_Survey ( L_OS ) L_grid L_references .
b1g-fragment02,1461,"Such a L_link is L_provided by the L_Central L_Postcode L_Directory , which L_matches all 1.5 million L_unit L_postcodes in the L_UK to L_grid L_references ."
b1g-fragment02,1462,When the L_cases of L_laryngeal L_cancer are L_compared with a L_null L_distribution ( L_provided by the L_distribution of L_much more L_common L_lung L_cancer ) the L_hypothesis is L_given L_strong L_support .
b1g-fragment02,1463,"Although the L_proposed L_method is L_novel , it is but one of an L_increasingly L_large L_number of L_methods L_designed to L_detect and L_model ‘ L_clusters ’ of L_disease ( L_see , for L_example , L_Cuzick and L_Edwards 1990 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1464,"The L_work of L_Diggle L_et al. ( 1990 ) L_examined only a L_single L_point L_source , though it L_generalizes to L_multiple L_sources and to L_linear L_hazards as L_well ."
b1g-fragment02,1465,As a L_second L_example of L_health L_work L_linked to L_hazard L_studies we may L_cite the L_research being L_conducted by L_Cross ( 1989 ) on L_childhood L_leukaemia .
b1g-fragment02,1466,There are L_numerous L_hypotheses L_concerning the L_aetiology of this L_disease ( from L_ionizing L_radiation to L_viral L_transmission ) and L_Cross 's L_approach is to L_collect L_digital L_data L_designed to L_test some of these L_hypotheses and to L_use ARC/INFO to L_display and L_analyse L_results .
b1g-fragment02,1467,"For L_instance , one L_hypothesis L_concerns the L_role of L_electromagnetic L_radiation , a L_source of which is L_overhead L_high-voltage L_transmission L_lines as L_noted L_earlier ."
b1g-fragment02,1468,If these are L_digitized and L_buffer L_zones L_constructed around them ( Fig. 10.3 ) we can L_quite L_easily L_test L_hypotheses about L_prevalence in such L_buffer L_zones as L_compared with L_prevalence L_outside .
b1g-fragment02,1469,"L_However , we should L_bear in L_mind the L_earlier L_point about the L_resolution of the L_data , since such L_electromagnetic L_effects have a very L_weak L_effect beyond L_perhaps 50 m ( L_Wertheimer and L_Leeper 1982 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1470,"There has been a L_suspicion for L_many L_years that L_high L_rates of L_stomach L_cancer in L_parts of L_Wales may be L_linked to L_soil L_chemistry , L_specifically such L_factors as zinc/copper L_ratios , and to L_lead L_content in L_water L_supplies ."
b1g-fragment02,1471,L_Matthews ( 1989 ) has L_used L_data from the L_Regional L_Cancer L_Registry ( L_morbidity L_rather than L_mortality L_data ) and L_data on L_trace L_elements to L_examine this L_link .
b1g-fragment02,1472,Since the L_latter are L_available for a 5 L_km L_raster the L_registration L_data are L_assigned to these L_grid L_squares L_using the L_OS L_grid L_reference .
b1g-fragment02,1473,"As with any such L_study there are the L_usual L_problems of L_ecological L_analysis and L_influences of L_migration , L_together with L_issues of L_separating out the L_risk L_factors under L_investigation from L_possible L_confounding L_factors ."
b1g-fragment02,1474,"In the L_USA , L_Morrill 's L_report on the L_beginnings of a $15m. L_study into the L_possible L_radiation L_doses L_received as L_result of L_radiation L_releases by the L_Hanford ( L_Washington L_State ) L_nuclear L_complex would L_seem to L_cry out for L_GIS L_skills to be L_applied ( L_Morrill 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1475,The L_research L_project will L_employ L_plume L_dispersion L_models in L_order to L_model L_dispersal by L_wind and will L_need to L_integrate this and other L_environmental L_data with L_detailed L_demographic L_records .
b1g-fragment02,1476,To some L_extent this L_line of L_approach was L_anticipated by L_Johnson ( 1981 ) in his L_study of L_exposure to L_plutonium L_fall-out from the L_Rocky L_Flats L_nuclear L_weapons L_plant near L_Denver ( L_see L_Zeigler et al. 1983 : 47–8 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1477,"L_Using L_soil L_samples he L_constructed a L_contoured L_risk L_surface and then L_mapped L_excess L_cancers in L_various L_distance L_bands , L_detecting a L_marked L_distance L_decay L_effect ."
b1g-fragment02,1478,L_Research L_problems and L_prospects
b1g-fragment02,1479,"The L_work L_reviewed above L_suggests that the L_application of L_GIS L_techniques to L_hazard L_assessment , L_emergency L_planning and L_environmental L_monitoring is both L_actually and L_potentially an L_important L_research L_area with L_many L_challenging L_problems ."
b1g-fragment02,1480,"L_Undoubtedly , the L_GISs of the 1990s will L_look very L_different from their L_rather L_primitive L_ancestors ."
b1g-fragment02,1481,"L_Computer L_power is L_becoming L_cheaper , L_digital L_data more L_readily L_available , and L_GISs are L_becoming L_hybrid L_systems L_involving other L_technologies ."
b1g-fragment02,1482,In this L_last L_section we L_highlight some L_important L_research L_areas as we L_see them .
b1g-fragment02,1483,"L_Doubtless there are L_many L_others , such is the L_surge of L_interest in L_GIS L_technology ."
b1g-fragment02,1484,L_Data L_availability
b1g-fragment02,1485,"We should L_first M_consider the L_availability and L_quality of L_data L_concerning the L_populations who may be at L_risk from the L_storage and L_transport of L_hazardous L_substances , from L_toxic L_air L_pollution , from L_flooding and so on ."
b1g-fragment02,1486,"Such L_data are L_crucial , either for L_assisting the L_emergency L_services to M_make M_assessments about M_resources they L_need to M_deploy in such L_events , or for M_high-quality L_estimates to be M_made of L_risk ."
b1g-fragment02,1487,"Within the L_public M_domain in the L_UK we must L_rely in L_general on L_data from the most L_recent L_Population L_Census , the M_lowest M_level being that for L_enumeration L_districts ( L_EDs ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1488,As is L_well L_known ( L_Rhind 1983 ) these L_contain on L_average L_perhaps 150–200 L_households and 400–500 L_people .
b1g-fragment02,1489,"The M_boundaries L_EDs have not been L_widely L_digitized , unlike the M_higher-level L_electoral L_wards ."
b1g-fragment02,1490,"L_However , the L_centroids of L_EDs are L_available as 100 m M_grid L_references and L_artificial L_ED ‘ L_polygons ’ can be L_created if L_necessary ."
b1g-fragment02,1491,In some L_instances such L_data will L_suffice ; in L_many L_cases they will have to L_suffice as L_nothing L_better is L_available .
b1g-fragment02,1492,But in some L_areas L_EDs are very L_extensive L_physical L_units and the L_shapes will be L_quite L_distorted .
b1g-fragment02,1493,"L_Furthermore , the M_scales at which L_population L_estimates are L_often L_required L_means that L_even L_EDs are too M_coarse for L_risk M_assessments ."
b1g-fragment02,1494,"For L_instance , in L_performing its L_quantitative L_risk M_assessments the L_Health and L_Safety L_Executive will L_rarely M_deal with L_distances from L_hazardous L_sites in L_excess of 1 L_km ( L_Petts 1988 ) and L_census L_data will not M_offer L_sufficient M_resolution for M_accurate L_population L_estimates to be M_made ."
b1g-fragment02,1495,"It should be M_pointed out , L_however , that the L_National L_Radiological L_Protection L_Board L_currently M_uses 1 L_km M_grid L_square L_resolution L_population L_data from the 1971 L_Census in its L_radiological L_protection L_studies ( L_Hallam L_et al. 1981 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1496,"It would L_seem that , despite the L_costs L_involved , they should M_consider L_investing in the very L_detailed L_digital L_data ( L_Pinpoint L_Address L_Code ( L_PAC ) ) L_provided by L_Pinpoint L_Analysis L_Ltd ."
b1g-fragment02,1497,This M_area of M_application would L_appear to be an L_obvious M_market for such a L_product .
b1g-fragment02,1498,A L_useful L_research M_exercise would be to L_compare the L_use of L_census and L_PAC L_data in M_deriving L_quantitative L_risk M_assessments and this is an L_interesting L_research L_problem .
b1g-fragment02,1499,L_Even with L_PAC L_data some M_assumptions would L_need to be M_made about L_numbers of L_persons per L_household if L_good L_population L_estimates were to be M_made .
b1g-fragment02,1500,"More L_generally , we L_need to M_consider the L_availability of M_large L_databases for L_hazard L_studies and L_emergency M_planning and this is an M_area M_ripe for L_major L_initiatives ."
b1g-fragment02,1501,In the L_UK we L_seem to be M_lagging L_well behind the L_USA in the M_construction of L_databases on L_hazardous L_sites and L_especially L_hazard L_events such as those L_involving L_toxic M_releases .
b1g-fragment02,1502,"For L_instance , L_Lioy and L_Daisey ( 1987 ) , in their L_work on the L_monitoring of L_toxic L_air L_pollution in L_New L_Jersey , M_construct what they L_term a ‘ M_microinventory ’ for each of three L_towns , L_comprising the L_locations of L_chemical M_plants , L_metal L_processing M_plants , L_paint L_spray L_manufacturers and so on ."
b1g-fragment02,1503,Some L_attribute L_information is L_available for these .
b1g-fragment02,1504,"More M_closely M_linked to L_GIS is L_work by L_McMaster and L_Johnson ( 1986 ) who L_perform a very L_detailed M_inventory of L_hazardous L_materials ( both L_stored and L_transported ) in L_Santa L_Monica , L_California ."
b1g-fragment02,1505,"Although the L_raster M_displays are very M_crude it is L_simple to L_answer L_spatial L_queries L_concerning the L_locations of L_people ( for L_instance , L_particular L_age L_groups ) within L_certain L_distances of L_toxic L_hazard L_sites ."
b1g-fragment02,1506,"We have L_data on some L_hazardous L_sites ( e.g. those M_regulated by L_CIMAH ) in the L_UK but a L_much more L_comprehensive M_approach should be M_adopted , L_especially if we are L_serious in the M_search for L_environmental M_associations with L_chronic L_diseases ."
b1g-fragment02,1507,The same is L_true for L_toxic M_releases .
b1g-fragment02,1508,"In the L_USA the L_Environmental L_Protection L_Agency M_produces an L_Acute L_Hazards L_Events L_Database while the L_Department of L_Transportation has a L_database M_recording L_details of 25 000 M_releases of L_toxic L_materials ; such L_details M_include L_locational L_information , L_type and L_amount of L_material M_released , L_mode of M_release and L_resulting L_injuries or L_deaths ( L_Cutter and L_Solecki 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1509,"Can we not L_use L_GIS L_technology to M_construct ‘ L_risk M_mosaics ’ ( L_Zeigler et al. 1983 ) , at a L_variety of L_spatial M_scales , L_akin to L_Hewitt and L_Burton 's ‘ L_hazardousness ’ of a L_place ?"
b1g-fragment02,1510,"In the L_UK only a M_handful of L_county L_emergency M_planning L_departments ( L_Cumbria , for L_instance ) have M_built up M_resource L_databases in L_digital M_form and this L_needs to be L_promoted ."
b1g-fragment02,1511,"Further M_afield , we L_need to M_recognize that some L_disasters ( most L_obviously L_Chernobyl ) will have L_implications for more than one L_country so that L_environmental L_monitoring should M_take M_place with some L_kind of L_international M_co-ordination ."
b1g-fragment02,1512,"There will L_also be L_movements of L_hazardous L_cargoes across L_frontiers and there are L_clearly L_problems of L_risk M_assessment and M_planning for L_emergencies at or near L_international L_boundaries , or at L_sea and L_airports ."
b1g-fragment02,1513,"As L_noted above , the L_work of L_Fedra ( 1989 ) is a L_major M_step in this M_direction , and M_links L_need to be M_forged between L_initiatives in the L_UK and the L_rest of L_Europe ."
b1g-fragment02,1514,"In L_terms of L_databases on L_hazardous L_wastes , L_attention has L_already been M_drawn to the L_waste L_disposal M_plans M_prepared by L_WRAs ."
b1g-fragment02,1515,"These M_give L_details of L_present L_site L_locations and some L_indication of L_permitted L_wastes , though L_little or no L_information on M_closed and L_abandoned L_sites ."
b1g-fragment02,1516,"L_However , for L_details of L_disposal the L_individual L_site L_licences must be M_consulted ."
b1g-fragment02,1517,"The L_former L_Hazardous L_Waste L_Inspectorate M_operated a M_large L_database on all L_sites , with L_details of L_permitted L_wastes , L_including L_allowable L_quantities ."
b1g-fragment02,1518,"The L_database was L_created by a L_commercial L_company , L_Aspinwalls L_Ltd ."
b1g-fragment02,1519,There are L_numerous L_potentially L_usable L_databases for L_environmental L_epidemiological L_work .
b1g-fragment02,1520,"L_OPCS , of L_course , is a L_major L_data M_repository for L_medical L_statistics and their L_various L_Monitor L_Series are of L_use , though only at the M_scale of L_district L_health L_authority and above ( L_see L_Gatrell and L_Lovett 1988 for an L_example ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1521,L_Regional L_health L_authorities will from L_time to L_time M_produce L_mortality L_data at L_ward M_level .
b1g-fragment02,1522,"L_However , if L_cancers are of L_interest it is more L_appropriate to M_obtain L_data from L_regional L_cancer L_registries ; these L_data are L_morbidity L_rather than L_mortality L_data and are L_therefore more M_valuable ."
b1g-fragment02,1523,The L_data are L_postcoded and may have some L_occupational L_details .
b1g-fragment02,1524,"For L_example , we have L_received L_data from the L_Regional L_Cancer L_Registry in L_Manchester L_comprising all L_cancers of the L_larynx and L_lung L_notified between 1974 and 1984 ."
b1g-fragment02,1525,"This M_large L_data M_set , to which M_grid L_references have now been L_added , L_comprises L_information about L_nearly 40 000 L_individuals ."
b1g-fragment02,1526,"It has now been M_copied into L_INGRES , a L_relational L_database L_management M_system , M_permitting L_queries to be M_made about M_subsets of the L_data ; for L_instance , all L_males between the L_ages of 25 and 64 L_suffering from L_laryngeal L_cancer ."
b1g-fragment02,1527,Other L_data M_sources on L_cancers are L_independent L_registries of L_malignancies .
b1g-fragment02,1528,"An L_example is that on L_leukaemias , L_managed by the L_Leukaemia L_Research L_Fund M_Centre in L_Leeds ( L_Alexander et al. 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1529,"It should be M_noted that there are L_frequently L_major L_discrepancies between the L_regional L_registries and the L_specialist L_registries , L_partly because the L_latter M_receive L_notifications M_directly from L_consultants ."
b1g-fragment02,1530,"L_Indeed , L_working M_directly with L_consultants L_proves L_invaluable in M_gaining M_access to M_high-quality L_morbidity L_data ."
b1g-fragment02,1531,Two other L_potential M_sources of L_data are M_worth M_mentioning .
b1g-fragment02,1532,"L_First , L_attention should be M_drawn to the L_new L_directive from the L_Department of L_Health to L_regional and L_district L_health L_authorities to L_review the L_health of the L_population ."
b1g-fragment02,1533,"This L_means in L_practice that L_district L_medical L_officers are M_charged with L_preparing an L_annual L_report , M_presenting and L_interpreting L_epidemiological L_data , L_identifying L_local L_health L_problems and L_evaluating L_service L_outcomes ."
b1g-fragment02,1534,L_Lancaster L_University is L_already M_heavily L_involved in the L_work of L_Preston L_District L_Health L_Authority in this L_area .
b1g-fragment02,1535,"L_Second , L_family L_health L_service L_authorities ( L_FHSAs ) , are L_also L_required to M_take on these M_roles , but from the M_viewpoint of L_primary L_health L_care L_services ."
b1g-fragment02,1536,"L_FHSAs ( which L_correspond to L_non-metropolitan L_counties and to L_metropolitan L_boroughs ) M_hold M_large L_databases on L_services L_provided by L_general L_practitioners ; for L_instance , L_uptake of L_immunization and L_screening for L_breast and L_cervical L_cancers ."
b1g-fragment02,1537,"Is it , we L_wonder , L_possible to M_contemplate L_bringing L_together some of these L_data M_sources to M_form a L_National L_Online L_Health L_Information M_System ( L_NOHIS ) , to M_parallel that for L_employment and L_unemployment ( L_Townsend L_et al. 1987 ) ?"
b1g-fragment02,1538,"This might M_include L_data on L_morbidity and L_mortality , L_uptake of L_preventative L_medicine , L_service L_use and L_availability , at both L_primary and L_hospital M_level ."
b1g-fragment02,1539,"It would be a L_useful L_management M_tool , L_particularly in L_view of the L_reorganization M_taking M_place in the L_National L_Health L_Service ."
b1g-fragment02,1540,It should not be L_forgotten that L_hazards themselves have L_geographical L_distributions L_yet there has been L_little L_effort in the L_UK to L_develop L_public M_domain L_databases .
b1g-fragment02,1541,Are there M_hazard-prone L_areas ?
b1g-fragment02,1542,Is there a L_regional L_differentiation in L_hazard L_type ?
b1g-fragment02,1543,"These are , of L_course , L_commercially L_important M_questions and a L_good M_deal of L_money is M_going into the M_collection of such L_data by L_insurance L_companies ."
b1g-fragment02,1544,One L_well L_known L_database is L_Major L_Hazard L_Incident L_Data L_Service ( L_MHIDAS ) L_global L_industrial L_hazards L_database which is L_currently being L_developed by the L_Safety and L_Reliability L_Directorate on L_behalf of the L_Major L_Hazards M_Assessment L_Unit of the L_UK L_Health and L_Safety L_Directorate .
b1g-fragment02,1545,This M_system L_currently M_runs in L_dBASE II and M_contains in L_excess of 3000 M_items of L_professionally M_assessed L_information on L_major L_hazards L_coded into some 24 L_separate M_fields .
b1g-fragment02,1546,"L_Unfortunately , the L_spatial L_referencing is M_poor and with some L_effort this could L_easily be L_remedied ."
b1g-fragment02,1547,"It is , for L_example , L_little L_use when L_recording a L_chemical L_spill into an L_Egyptian L_river to have M_entered into the L_appropriate M_field ‘ the L_Nile ’ — after all , this L_river is some 6480 L_km L_long !"
b1g-fragment02,1548,"Here , in our M_view , is a L_classic L_case of the L_absence of a L_geographical M_input M_rendering the L_data of L_limited M_value ."
b1g-fragment02,1549,"In some L_cases , L_good L_hazard L_data L_exist but have L_simply not L_yet M_found their M_way into a L_GIS ."
b1g-fragment02,1550,A L_case in M_point is L_inland and L_coastal L_flooding .
b1g-fragment02,1551,Most L_river L_authorities have L_detailed L_maps M_showing the L_geographical L_limits of L_floods in L_relation to their M_return L_periods .
b1g-fragment02,1552,"Within the L_next L_decade , as the L_privatized L_water L_companies L_develop their L_GIS , we shall L_see a M_massive L_amount of L_data L_conversion in this M_area ."
b1g-fragment02,1553,"This L_development , L_together with the L_availability of L_digital L_terrain M_models , will M_allow L_quite M_sophisticated L_flood L_forecasting M_models to be L_developed within a L_GIS M_framework ."
b1g-fragment02,1554,"As L_sea-levels L_rise in the L_next 20–30 L_years L_due to the ‘ L_greenhouse ’ L_effect , this very L_practical L_use of L_GIS L_technology is L_likely to L_become L_commonplace and of L_considerable L_practical L_importance ."
b1g-fragment02,1555,L_Spatial L_statistics
b1g-fragment02,1556,Another M_way in which there L_needs to be a M_rapprochement between L_statistical L_methods and L_GIS is in the M_area of L_spatial M_sampling and L_estimation from L_spatial M_samples .
b1g-fragment02,1557,This is L_clearly an L_important L_issue in L_radiation L_monitoring as the M_discussion of L_RIMNET above M_implies .
b1g-fragment02,1558,"As an L_example , L_Peirson ( 1988 ) has L_reviewed the L_evidence on L_artificial L_radioactivity in L_Cumbria and L_shows L_maps of the L_distribution of L_certain L_radionuclides as L_contoured L_surfaces ."
b1g-fragment02,1559,The M_point M_worth M_making here is that there are L_many L_alternative L_schemes for L_interpolating from L_irregular M_point L_data ( L_Lam 1983 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1560,"One L_method in L_particular , L_kriging ( now L_available as M_part of the L_UNIRAS L_software ) , M_offers not only a L_contoured L_surface but L_also an L_estimate of the L_standard L_error at any L_point on the L_map ."
b1g-fragment02,1561,Where this is M_high it M_suggests that an L_additional M_sampling L_station might be L_set up .
b1g-fragment02,1562,Such L_techniques are now L_standard in L_environmental L_science ( L_see L_Streit 1981 for an M_application to L_rainfall L_monitoring ) and L_need to be L_promoted M_vigorously in L_hazard L_studies ( L_Estes L_et al. 1987 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1563,M_Related to this L_problem is that of M_making L_population L_estimates for L_new L_zones that L_result from M_overlay M_operations .
b1g-fragment02,1564,"We may L_want to L_count L_numbers L_living within M_plumes , L_circles of M_fixed L_radius , L_buffer L_zones and so on ."
b1g-fragment02,1565,"L_Existing L_GIS L_techniques L_usually M_base the L_estimates on L_area-weighted M_shares , so that a L_new L_polygon L_created by ‘ M_slicing ’ an L_existing L_area in L_half is M_assigned half the L_population of that M_source L_unit ."
b1g-fragment02,1566,"This may be L_quite L_absurd in some L_cases , L_notably where L_population is L_spatially L_clustered within a L_physically L_large L_ED ."
b1g-fragment02,1567,"At the L_NWRRL L_work is under L_way ( L_Flowerdew and L_Green 1989 ) to L_solve such L_problems L_using the L_EM L_algorithm and the L_statistical M_modelling M_package L_GLIM , which has been M_interfaced with ARC/INFO ."
b1g-fragment02,1568,M_Operations L_research L_methods and L_simulation
b1g-fragment02,1569,While there is some L_research L_activity in M_linking L_statistical M_models to L_GIS there would L_seem to be L_scope for further M_applications of M_operations L_research L_techniques to L_GIS L_problems .
b1g-fragment02,1570,"Within some M_sophisticated L_GIS such as ARC/INFO there are some L_useful L_algorithms ( such as M_shortest M_path L_calculations ) , but L_GIS L_developers have in L_general M_failed to L_realize the L_natural M_links between L_GIS L_functions and L_many M_operations L_research L_techniques ."
b1g-fragment02,1571,Over the L_last 20 L_years or so a M_large L_theoretical L_literature has been L_developed to L_provide M_tools for the M_solution of L_many L_problems L_associated with L_emergency M_planning ( L_Kolesar 1981 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1572,One L_important L_class of L_problems is the L_selection of L_locations for the L_emergency L_service L_units .
b1g-fragment02,1573,"The L_choice of L_locations need not be for L_permanent L_bases , but can L_also M_include L_dynamic L_repositioning of L_units as L_circumstances M_dictate ( L_Kolesar and L_Walker 1974 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1574,In any L_major L_emergency a L_typical L_problem is the M_assignment of M_resources to L_demands .
b1g-fragment02,1575,"If M_resources are M_held at one L_set of L_locations and the L_demands are at another and the L_costs of L_transportation are L_known , how do we L_allocate the M_resources most L_efficiently ?"
b1g-fragment02,1576,"In a L_major L_emergency , for L_example , there might be a L_need to L_supply L_blood L_products M_held at L_regional L_blood L_banks to L_hospitals ."
b1g-fragment02,1577,"This , of L_course , is the L_classic L_transportation L_problem and its M_solution is L_well L_known ."
b1g-fragment02,1578,"As M_far as we L_know the M_microcomputer-based L_emergency M_response M_system L_devised by L_Belardo L_et al. ( 1983 ) , is the only L_GIS-like L_software to L_incorporate this L_algorithm ."
b1g-fragment02,1579,"In this M_system , the M_solution to the L_transportation L_problem is L_shown L_graphically on the L_road L_network , which is L_displayed on the L_computer L_screen ."
b1g-fragment02,1580,As a L_last L_example of the L_potential M_role of M_operations L_research in L_GIS and L_disaster L_management we are L_reminded of the L_logistic L_problems that M_faced the L_Peel L_Regional L_Police L_Force during the L_Mississauga L_evacuation M_mentioned L_previously ( L_Scanlon and L_Padgham 1980 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1581,During the L_early M_states of the L_phased L_evacuation the L_logistical L_problem M_facing the L_police was the L_street-by-street L_warning of the L_population to M_make L_ready for L_evacuation .
b1g-fragment02,1582,L_Speed was of the M_essence and L_manpower was L_limited .
b1g-fragment02,1583,"Here , then , is a L_familiar M_operations L_research M_network L_problem : all L_roads have to be L_traversed such that the L_journey length/time is a L_minimum ."
b1g-fragment02,1584,"This is the L_so-called M_Chinese M_postman M_problem , which L_provides a L_Hamiltonian L_circuit through the L_arcs ( as L_compared with the M_travelling M_salesman M_problem which is a L_minimum M_route through the M_network M_nodes ) ."
bpa-fragment14,2036,L_Grant 's L_remains were L_shovelled into a L_canvas L_bag .
bpa-fragment14,2037,"M_Tense , L_facing L_outwards , L_Forster , L_Lawton and L_Nell L_guarded L_Delaney as he L_intoned the L_seaman 's L_prayer of L_interment , and then M_committed the L_canvas L_bag to the L_ocean ."

bpa-fragment14,2048,L_Nobody L_spoke L_immediately .

bpa-fragment14,2054,‘ L_Nell ? ’
bpa-fragment14,2055,"L_Delaney L_asked , L_looking at her L_squarely ."

bpa-fragment14,2058,"‘ We do n't L_know what we 're up against , ’ L_Delaney L_said , ‘ so L_let's M_proceed with L_maximum L_caution . ’"
bpa-fragment14,2059,"‘ L_Trouble is , ’ L_Lawton L_said , with a L_frown , ‘ there are n't L_enough of us to L_search the L_ship ."

bpa-fragment14,2062,"‘ That 's why we 've L_got to M_take L_risks , ’ L_Nell M_put in ."
bpa-fragment14,2063,"‘ M_Lure it into a M_trap , L_somehow ."
bpa-fragment14,2064,And L_quickly .
bpa-fragment14,2065,L_Forster 's L_chuckle was L_mirthless .
bpa-fragment14,2066,‘ I do n't L_think this M_joker is L_going to L_need L_much L_encouragement . ’
bpa-fragment14,2067,‘ No . ’
bpa-fragment14,2068,L_Delaney was L_momentarily L_thoughtful .
bpa-fragment14,2069,"‘ What had you in L_mind , L_Nell ? ’"
bpa-fragment14,2070,"She L_pointed to the L_figure of a L_man L_propped in the L_corner , and the L_cylinders of L_oxygen in the L_back L_pack M_lying beside it ."

bpa-fragment14,2074,They L_looked at the ‘ M_man ’ L_Forster had L_found .

bpa-fragment14,2084,L_Forster 's L_breathing M_whistled out of the L_one-way L_valve .
bpa-fragment14,2085,"Behind the L_clear , L_wide L_vizor , he L_tried to L_smile ."

bpa-fragment14,2089,L_Delaney M_took the L_lead .
bpa-fragment14,2090,"It was now L_light , the L_lamps on the L_gangway M_giving M_murky L_yellow M_pools that L_barely M_pushed M_back the M_inky L_blackness of a L_starless L_night ."
bpa-fragment14,2091,At the L_entrance to the L_laboratory L_complex the L_others L_drew on their own L_masks .
bpa-fragment14,2092,"L_Ineffectual or not against L_lingering L_gases it L_seemed a M_wise L_precaution , L_even if it was only L_psychological ."
bpa-fragment14,2093,L_Delaney L_glanced L_back at them .
bpa-fragment14,2094,‘ L_Let's M_make L_sure it M_knows where we are . ’
bpa-fragment14,2095,They M_made L_noise ; L_slammed L_doors .
bpa-fragment14,2096,L_Nell L_shuddered .
bpa-fragment14,2097,Were L_unseen L_eyes L_watching them ?
bpa-fragment14,2098,"Was it L_even now M_shadowing them , L_moving L_soundlessly from L_cover to L_cover , like a M_tiger in the M_steel M_jungle ?"
bpa-fragment14,2099,L_Forster 's radio-projected L_voice M_broke into her L_thoughts .
bpa-fragment14,2100,‘ L_Looks a L_good L_place . ’
bpa-fragment14,2101,He was at the L_entrance to the M_secure L_lab L_zone .

bpa-fragment14,2103,L_Forster was L_quickly L_de-suited .
bpa-fragment14,2104,"As they L_set up the now L_empty L_suit with its M_back to the L_door , L_half M_slumped over a L_control L_panel , he L_settled down behind the L_curtained L_entrance of the L_showers ."
bpa-fragment14,2105,L_Delaney 's L_voice was L_hushed .
bpa-fragment14,2106,‘ L_Maybe we should L_leave two of us here ? ’
bpa-fragment14,2107,‘ Do n't L_want to M_rouse any L_suspicions .

bpa-fragment14,2110,"When he did n't M_get any L_response , he L_patted the L_Uzi beside him on the L_steel L_floor ."

bpa-fragment14,2113,L_Lawton L_came and L_crouched down in L_front of it .
bpa-fragment14,2114,"‘ I 've M_left the L_suit 's L_radio on M_full , ’ he L_said ."

bpa-fragment14,2120,L_Nell L_shuddered .
bpa-fragment14,2121,L_Night .
bpa-fragment14,2122,This was a L_night in their L_minds — a L_creature from the M_darker M_side of L_man 's L_intellect .
bpa-fragment14,2123,L_Something L_worried her about that L_thought .
bpa-fragment14,2124,L_Something M_hidden behind the more L_obvious L_sentiment .
bpa-fragment14,2125,"After they 'd L_gone , L_Forster M_felt the L_silence L_physically M_settle around him ."
bpa-fragment14,2126,"He 'd L_never been one to M_exercise an over-imagination , yet the L_conditions were like the M_feeling of a M_tomb — of an M_interment ."
bpa-fragment14,2127,"Would he be L_found , he L_mused , a thousand L_years from then , a L_dust-covered L_skeleton ?"
bpa-fragment14,2128,He L_chuckled .
bpa-fragment14,2129,"And the L_Uzi a M_primitive L_weapon , the L_bio L_suit L_mistaken for some L_sort of M_ceremonial M_armour ?"
bpa-fragment14,2130,The L_first L_stunning L_silence M_gave M_way to the L_creaking of the L_ship and a L_far-off L_booming of the L_sea against the L_hull .
bpa-fragment14,2131,The L_radio on the M_dummy L_suddenly M_screeched into M_action as L_Delaney 's L_distorted L_voice M_gave it M_life .
bpa-fragment14,2132,The L_thousands of L_tons of L_steel M_made L_real L_communication L_impossible .
bpa-fragment14,2133,His own L_radio was off .
bpa-fragment14,2134,"L_Forster L_settled down , only L_putting his L_eye to the L_slit every M_half L_minute , not L_continually as he had L_started to do ."
bpa-fragment14,2135,He had a L_good L_view of the L_long L_shadowy L_main L_corridor .
bpa-fragment14,2136,"The only L_problem was if — he M_corrected himself — when it L_came , which L_side L_turning , if any , would it M_use ."
bpa-fragment14,2137,The further L_away the L_better .
bpa-fragment14,2138,The more L_time to L_see it L_approach .
bpa-fragment14,2139,The L_trouble was the L_transverse L_corridor just outside the L_room .
bpa-fragment14,2140,"If the L_approach was that L_way he would M_get no L_warning at all , and it would be on M_top of L_George — his L_name for the M_dummy M_sitting like a M_drunken M_son-of-a-bitch — before he L_knew it ."
bpa-fragment14,2141,"If that L_happened , he 'd have to L_work L_fast ."
bpa-fragment14,2142,What he 'd L_seen done to L_Grant M_made L_Forster L_realise that whatever it was L_struck with L_demonic L_speed and L_savagery .
bpa-fragment14,2143,"In L_seconds , M_poor M_old L_George would be L_spread around the L_room like an M_explosion in M_Harrod 's M_window , and the L_thing would be L_away ."
bpa-fragment14,2144,Or on him .
bpa-fragment14,2145,"As if in L_protest , L_George M_uttered a L_blood-curdling , L_lunatic-sounding M_cackle , and L_fell L_fractionally L_forward ."
bpa-fragment14,2146,L_Forster L_suppressed a M_nervous L_giggle .

bpa-fragment14,2155,Against what ?
bpa-fragment14,2156,"Like L_Forster , all he could L_guess was that it was L_fast ."
bpa-fragment14,2157,"L_Grant may have been L_lame , but … L_fast or L_silent ?"
bpa-fragment14,2158,Or both ?
bpa-fragment14,2159,The L_speed of L_descent must have M_cut down the L_exposure to any L_residual L_gas since he M_felt L_none of the L_earlier L_weirdness as he L_approached the L_still L_sealed L_engine L_room L_door .
bpa-fragment14,2160,M_Pandora 's M_Box ?
bpa-fragment14,2161,He L_winced at the L_memory as he L_hammered on the L_steel and then L_looked through the M_spy M_port .
bpa-fragment14,2162,"In the M_stroboscopic L_view , the L_giant L_pistons were the only L_things L_moving — until a L_figure L_detached itself from the L_wall , its L_grey L_colour L_exactly that of the L_background L_steel ."
bpa-fragment14,2163,"Like a M_chameleon , it L_moved out of the L_aisle between L_machines , then L_stopped , and L_became L_utterly L_motionless ."

bpa-fragment14,2165,L_Nell 's M_transceivered L_voice L_crackled in his L_headphones .
bpa-fragment14,2166,‘ What is it ? ’
bpa-fragment14,2167,He did n't L_want to M_take his L_eyes from it — L_equally he L_wanted L_somebody L_else to L_see it .
bpa-fragment14,2168,To L_confirm .
bpa-fragment14,2169,"M_Gently as though he might L_disturb it , he L_pulled L_back ."
bpa-fragment14,2170,‘ M_Take a L_look for yourself . ’
bpa-fragment14,2171,She did — and M_caught her L_breath .
bpa-fragment14,2172,"The L_creature was L_large-headed , L_absurdly so , its L_body L_half L_man , L_half L_something M_lost in the L_primordial L_past ."

bpa-fragment14,2177,"But L_also , as a L_doctor , she L_knew L_exactly what it was ."
bpa-fragment14,2178,"She L_told L_Delaney , who L_shook his L_head with L_revulsion ."
bpa-fragment14,2179,"L_Nell would L_never L_rest until she could L_get L_closer to L_confirm her L_worst L_suspicions , and L_paradoxically it was the L_woman in her that L_provided the L_intensity of L_emotion that would L_let L_nothing M_stand in her M_way ."
bpa-fragment14,2180,"L_George , the L_sacrificial M_dummy , had n't L_emitted a L_squeak for a M_long L_time ."
bpa-fragment14,2181,L_Forster L_scanned the L_corridor once more .
bpa-fragment14,2182,It was L_empty .
bpa-fragment14,2183,just as it L_always had been .
bpa-fragment14,2184,"He L_sat L_back again , L_eyeing the L_blank L_wall before him , L_confident that he 'd L_catch it , L_however L_good it was ."
bpa-fragment14,2185,He L_kept L_wondering how it had M_got L_Silk .
bpa-fragment14,2186,"L_Silk was the L_meanest , M_toughest L_professional he 'd L_ever L_known ."
bpa-fragment14,2187,"And L_yet he 'd L_disappeared , without L_trace ."
bpa-fragment14,2188,L_Forster was a L_fatalist .
bpa-fragment14,2189,He L_shrugged .
bpa-fragment14,2190,"You could be L_James L_Bond , he L_thought , but if L_something had your M_number on it …"
bpa-fragment14,2191,"A M_gentle L_breeze M_broke the L_absolute L_silence , L_moving the L_curtain so that he had to L_steady it with his L_hand ."
bpa-fragment14,2192,"L_Instantly L_alert , L_Forster L_checked through his M_spy M_port ."
bpa-fragment14,2193,L_Nothing .
bpa-fragment14,2194,But a L_door had L_opened L_somewhere .
bpa-fragment14,2195,"L_Somebody , or L_something , had L_entered the L_complex ."
bpa-fragment14,2196,It could be the L_others L_returning — or the L_start of his L_ambush .
bpa-fragment14,2197,‘ For L_God 's L_sake L_leave your L_mask on .
bpa-fragment14,2198,And that 's an L_order ! ’
bpa-fragment14,2199,But L_Delaney 's L_plea was in L_vain .
bpa-fragment14,2200,"L_Nell L_pulled it off , L_got L_close to the L_door , and L_shouted ."
bpa-fragment14,2201,‘ We L_mean you no L_harm .
bpa-fragment14,2202,You can L_help us . ’
bpa-fragment14,2203,"When she L_checked through the L_spyhole it was L_standing in L_exactly the same M_spot , L_unmoving , like a M_lizard ."
bpa-fragment14,2204,L_Lawton L_shook his L_head .
bpa-fragment14,2205,‘ Ca n't L_hear you .
bpa-fragment14,2206,L_Try the L_ship 's L_system again . ’
bpa-fragment14,2207,"L_Nell L_ran to the L_wall L_telephone , and L_pushed the L_digit for L_engine L_room ."
bpa-fragment14,2208,The L_small L_light beneath the M_receiver L_rests M_showed that the M_line was M_working .
bpa-fragment14,2209,"L_Worried , L_Delaney L_followed , M_searching her L_face , L_fearing the L_tell-tale M_signs of L_toxicity ."
bpa-fragment14,2210,"On L_impulse , and against his L_better L_judgment , he L_pulled off his own L_mask ."
bpa-fragment14,2211,"L_Nell L_repeatedly L_pressed the L_button , L_shouted across at L_Lawton , who was now L_using the M_spy M_port ."
bpa-fragment14,2212,‘ What 's L_happening ? ’
bpa-fragment14,2213,"The M_back of L_Lawton 's L_head L_shook , his radio-projected L_voice L_crackling ."
bpa-fragment14,2214,‘ L_Nothing now .
bpa-fragment14,2215,"The L_head M_jerked , just the once , to the L_left , so I M_reckon it L_heard the ‘ L_phone . ’"
bpa-fragment14,2216,"He L_straightened up and L_came over , M_directing his L_question at L_Delaney ."
bpa-fragment14,2217,‘ We ought to L_get on . ’
bpa-fragment14,2218,L_Delaney L_nodded his L_agreement .
bpa-fragment14,2219,"‘ L_Leave it , L_Nell . ’"
bpa-fragment14,2220,His L_tone was M_sharp .
bpa-fragment14,2221,‘ It 's not L_going L_anywhere . ’
bpa-fragment14,2222,"She M_squared up to him , L_defiantly ,"
bpa-fragment14,2223,"‘ I ca n't , L_John ."
bpa-fragment14,2224,Do n't you M_see ?
bpa-fragment14,2225,The M_poor L_thing is M_part of this L_madness .
bpa-fragment14,2226,"If we can L_get to it , I can L_learn so L_much more ."
bpa-fragment14,2227,"And in any L_case , it might L_die if we do n't L_try and L_help it … L_soon . ’"
bpa-fragment14,2228,"L_Delaney M_averted his L_gaze from her , L_afraid of what he had L_seen in her L_eyes ."
bpa-fragment14,2229,‘ L_Perhaps it would be L_better if it did . ’
bpa-fragment14,2230,"‘ You do n't L_mean that , ’ she L_said , L_stepping L_away from him ."
bpa-fragment14,2231,"L_Delaney M_fiddled L_awkwardly with his L_mask , L_preparatory to L_putting it L_back on again ."
bpa-fragment14,2232,"‘ For L_God 's L_sake , L_Nell ."
bpa-fragment14,2233,"All I L_mean is , we 've M_got a M_job to do ."
bpa-fragment14,2234,And L_Forster 's M_neck 's on the M_line .
bpa-fragment14,2235,Do n't you M_owe it to him to L_come now ? ’
bpa-fragment14,2236,"She M_flushed , but L_held on to the ‘ L_phone ."
bpa-fragment14,2237,"L_Obviously L_striving to be as M_controlled as L_possible , she L_smiled ."
bpa-fragment14,2238,"‘ You two can M_manage , ’ she L_said L_calmly ."
bpa-fragment14,2239,"‘ I can do L_better here , on my own ."
bpa-fragment14,2240,L_Quietly .
bpa-fragment14,2241,If I L_succeed it will M_unlock a M_lot of the L_mystery of what 's been done on L_Titron .
bpa-fragment14,2242,And … ’
bpa-fragment14,2243,She L_faltered .
bpa-fragment14,2244,‘ … I L_think we M_owe it to that L_pathetic L_creature in there . ’
bpa-fragment14,2245,‘ L_Pathetic ? ’
bpa-fragment14,2246,L_Delaney L_tried to L_play down the L_fear in his L_voice — L_fear for her .
bpa-fragment14,2247,‘ It might be L_bloody L_dangerous .
bpa-fragment14,2248,"L_Certainly , L_something on this L_ship is . ’"
bpa-fragment14,2249,"‘ Not this one , ’ L_Nell L_said , L_shaking her L_head with some L_kind of L_reassurance ."
bpa-fragment14,2250,‘ I just L_know . ’
bpa-fragment14,2251,L_Lawton L_gestured in the L_gangway .
bpa-fragment14,2252,‘ You may not be at L_risk from what is in here .
bpa-fragment14,2253,What about out there ?
bpa-fragment14,2254,There 's no L_guarantee that what we 're L_hunting is L_going to M_follow the M_rules . ’
bpa-fragment14,2255,L_Nell L_shrugged .
bpa-fragment14,2256,‘ That 's a L_risk I 'll have to M_take .
bpa-fragment14,2257,I 've M_got a more L_important M_job here . ’
bpa-fragment14,2258,L_Delaney L_knew there was no M_way she would be M_shifted from her L_chosen M_course .
bpa-fragment14,2259,"L_Ordering her would be L_ludicrous under the L_changed L_circumstances , and in any L_event , a M_waste of L_time ."
bpa-fragment14,2260,But L_Lawton was L_right .
bpa-fragment14,2261,"The L_risk from the other L_danger , or L_dangers of L_Titron , L_frightened him more ."
bpa-fragment14,2262,"‘ L_Help me M_secure the L_stairs behind us , ’ he M_snapped at L_Lawton , ‘ as L_much as we can . ’"
bpa-fragment14,2263,L_Delaney L_turned to L_Nell .
bpa-fragment14,2264,‘ It might M_buy you the L_time you L_need .
bpa-fragment14,2265,But M_take L_care .
bpa-fragment14,2266,"Do n't be L_bloody L_foolish like I am , L_leaving you here ."
bpa-fragment14,2267,L_Establish M_contact if you can .
bpa-fragment14,2268,No more at this M_stage .
bpa-fragment14,2269,L_Understand ?
bpa-fragment14,2270,And do n't L_try and L_get the L_door L_open . ’
bpa-fragment14,2271,But L_Nell was L_hardly L_listening .
bpa-fragment14,2272,"To L_please him she L_nodded , then despite L_Lawton 's L_presence , L_squeezed L_Delaney 's L_arm ."
bpa-fragment14,2273,‘ And you . ’
bpa-fragment14,2274,She L_smiled .
bpa-fragment14,2275,‘ L_Watch out . ’
bpa-fragment14,2276,"L_Reluctantly , L_Delaney M_made for the L_gangway ."
bpa-fragment14,2277,"L_Lawton had L_already L_shifted some L_chairs , in L_readiness to L_form a L_barricade ."
bpa-fragment14,2278,"He M_gave him a L_hand with a L_large L_oil M_drum , and then another , as L_Nell , M_tearing herself from her L_appointed L_task , L_dragged over a L_bench ."
bpa-fragment14,2279,"As they L_drew L_back up the L_stairs , L_piling on the L_pieces she L_threw up at them , L_Lawton L_sniffed ."
bpa-fragment14,2280,‘ This wo n't M_hold L_anything .
bpa-fragment14,2281,Just L_slow it down . ’
bpa-fragment14,2282,"Like L_Forster before her , L_Nell L_indicated her L_pistol and L_grenades ."
bpa-fragment14,2283,"‘ As L_long as there 's ti me , that 's all we L_need . ’"
bpa-fragment14,2284,"As they L_descended the L_stairs , L_Delaney L_paused , and M_took a L_last L_look down at her ."
bpa-fragment14,2285,"She L_smiled L_shyly , then L_turned L_away ."
bpa-fragment14,2286,"In a L_sense , as L_long as he could L_convince himself that she was L_safe , he was L_glad she was n't L_coming with them ."
bpa-fragment14,2287,"Whatever it was they were after , it was an L_unknown L_quantity , L_unknown , that is , except for a L_lethal L_ferocity ."
bpa-fragment14,2288,"He L_pulled on his L_respirator , his L_mind M_made up to L_get L_back to her as L_soon as he could , for L_Nell L_Anderson was all he L_cared about now ."
bpa-fragment14,2289,There it L_went again .
bpa-fragment14,2290,L_Forster L_frowned as he L_looked through his L_spy L_hole .
bpa-fragment14,2291,A L_sound .
bpa-fragment14,2292,"He could n't M_place it , but it L_reminded him M_strongly of L_something ."
bpa-fragment14,2293,The L_corridor was L_empty .
bpa-fragment14,2294,It had L_happened three L_times now .
bpa-fragment14,2295,"A L_hissing , We L_gas M_escaping , L_ending with a M_funny M_little L_squeak ."
bpa-fragment14,2296,"He L_looked at L_George , L_wondering if the L_sound had M_come from him ."
bpa-fragment14,2297,"L_Satisfied that L_everything was as it should be , he L_checked his L_watch ."
bpa-fragment14,2298,L_Well over half an L_hour had M_passed .
bpa-fragment14,2299,They ought to be near him L_soon .
bpa-fragment14,2300,L_Forster L_searched in a L_pouch and L_came up with a L_glucose L_sweet .
bpa-fragment14,2301,"L_Quietly he L_unwrapped the L_covering L_paper , then L_paused , as some L_instinct M_made him L_check again ."
bpa-fragment14,2302,"As he did so , the L_sound M_came nearer ; L_louder ."
bpa-fragment14,2303,His L_intense L_scrutiny M_took in the L_shadowy and L_empty L_lengths of the L_corridor .
bpa-fragment14,2304,"L_Apart from some M_dark M_patches on the L_wall that he had n't L_noticed before , there was L_nothing to L_see ."
bpa-fragment14,2305,"His L_gaze M_came M_back to L_George , L_still L_sprawled over the L_control L_desk ."
bpa-fragment14,2306,"A L_fly L_landed on the L_empty , M_staring L_vizor , and L_crawled across it ."
bpa-fragment14,2307,"L_Forster was L_sorely L_tempted to M_nip out and L_confirm that the L_noise was M_coming from L_George by L_twiddling the L_volume and L_tuner , but M_fought down the L_urge ."
bpa-fragment14,2308,"He L_sat L_back , L_pulled off his L_mask , and M_popped the L_sweet into his L_mouth ."
bpa-fragment14,2309,It M_took him only L_seconds to L_notice the L_smell .
bpa-fragment14,2310,L_Forster L_choked as the L_putrefying L_reek L_seemed to L_get L_right into him .
bpa-fragment14,2311,"L_Frightened that it was a L_gas M_pocket , he L_fumbled with his L_mask , and L_finally L_got it M_back on ."
bpa-fragment14,2312,His L_heart was L_thumping .
bpa-fragment14,2313,"L_Nothing L_seemed to be L_happening , all his L_senses were L_apparently L_functioning L_normally , except … that the L_sweet in his L_mouth L_seemed L_permeated with the L_awful L_smell ; had L_become a L_slimy L_lump of L_filth ."
bpa-fragment14,2314,He had to L_get L_rid of it .
bpa-fragment14,2315,"L_Forster L_reached for his L_mask , just as the M_hissing L_gas L_noise L_sounded L_right on M_top of him , L_ending with a M_little L_shriek ."
bpa-fragment14,2316,He L_knew then where he 'd L_heard L_something L_similar before .
bpa-fragment14,2317,"It was like a L_man L_breathing through a L_respiratory L_system , with some L_sort of L_one-way L_valve ."
bpa-fragment14,2318,"A L_shadow M_fell across the L_wall L_opposite , as L_slowly , and L_fearfully he L_turned ."
bpa-fragment14,2319,"The L_curtain was a M_dense , L_opaque L_greenish-yellow , and L_something was L_right behind it , a L_shape L_pressing against the M_humped L_plastic L_standing there L_looking down at him , L_half L_seen , L_half L_imagined ."
bpa-fragment14,2320,"His L_hand M_went out , M_reached for the L_submachine L_gun , his L_fingers M_tightening on the L_stock ."
bpa-fragment14,2321,"With a L_blood-curdling L_growl , the L_curtain was L_snatched L_aside ."
bpa-fragment14,2322,"L_Forster M_half L_rolled , his L_Uzi M_trembling in his L_hand as he M_got off half a L_clip at L_point L_blank M_range ."
bpa-fragment14,2323,But it L_struck with the L_speed of an M_attacking M_snake .
bpa-fragment14,2324,"And L_something L_else ; L_something he L_saw as the L_curtain L_tore L_away and he L_looked into the M_depths of the L_unbelievable L_face above him , L_fractionally L_dulled his L_reflexes ."
c8t-fragment01,1,L_Friday 16 L_September to L_Tuesday 20 L_September
c8t-fragment01,2,"Once M_free of the M_knotted M_tentacles of the L_eastern L_suburbs , L_Dalgliesh M_made L_good L_time and by three he was L_driving through L_Lydsett L_village ."
c8t-fragment01,3,"Here a L_right L_turn M_took him off the L_coastal L_road on to what was L_little more than a L_smoothly L_macadamed L_track L_bordered by L_water-filled L_ditches and L_fringed by a M_golden M_haze of L_reeds , their M_lumbered M_heads M_straining in the L_wind ."
c8t-fragment01,4,"And now , for the L_first L_time , he L_thought that he could L_smell the L_North L_Sea , that L_potent but M_half-illusory L_tang L_evoking L_nostalgic L_memories of L_childhood L_holidays , of L_solitary L_adolescent L_walks as he M_struggled with his L_first L_poems , of his L_aunt 's L_tall L_figure at his L_side , L_binoculars L_round her L_neck , L_striding towards the M_haunts of her L_beloved L_birds ."
c8t-fragment01,5,"And here , M_barring the L_road , was the L_familiar L_old L_farm L_gate L_still in L_place ."
c8t-fragment01,6,Its L_continued L_presence L_always M_surprised him since it M_served no L_purpose that he could M_see except L_symbolically to M_cut off the M_headland and to M_give L_travellers L_pause to L_consider whether they L_really L_wanted to L_continue .
c8t-fragment01,7,"It L_swung L_open at his L_touch but L_closing it , as L_always , was more L_difficult and he L_lugged and L_half L_lifted it into L_place and L_slipped the L_circle of L_wire over the L_gatepost with a M_familiar L_sensation of having M_turned his M_back on the L_workaday M_world and L_entered L_country which , no L_matter how L_frequent his L_visits , would L_always be M_alien M_territory ."
c8t-fragment01,8,He was L_driving now across the L_open L_headland towards the L_fringe of L_pine L_trees which L_bordered the L_North L_Sea .
c8t-fragment01,9,"The only L_house to his L_left was the L_old L_Victorian L_rectory , a L_square , L_red-brick L_building , L_incongruous behind its M_struggling L_hedge of L_rhododendron and L_laurel ."
c8t-fragment01,10,"To his L_right the L_ground M_rose M_gently towards the L_southern L_cliffs and he could L_see the L_dark M_mouth of a L_concrete M_pillbox , L_undemolished since the L_war , and as L_seemingly L_indestructible as the L_great L_hulks of wave-battered L_concrete , L_remnants of the L_old L_fortifications which M_lay half-submerged in the L_sand along L_part of the L_beach ."
c8t-fragment01,11,"To the L_north the L_broken L_arches and M_stumps of the L_ruined L_Benedictine L_abbey L_gleamed M_golden in the L_afternoon L_sun against the M_crinkled L_blue of the L_sea and , L_breasting a L_small L_ridge , he L_glimpsed for the L_first L_time the L_topsail of L_Larksoken L_Mill and beyond it , against the L_skyline , the L_great L_grey L_bulk of L_Larksoken L_Nuclear L_power L_Station ."
c8t-fragment01,12,"The L_road he was on , M_veering L_left , would M_lead L_eventually to the L_station but was , he L_knew , L_seldom L_used since L_normal L_traffic and all L_heavy L_vehicles M_used the L_new L_access L_road to the L_north ."
c8t-fragment01,13,"The L_headland was L_empty and L_almost M_bare , the few M_straggling L_trees , L_distorted by the L_wind , M_struggled to M_keep their L_precarious M_hold in the M_uncompromising L_soil ."
c8t-fragment01,14,"And now he was L_passing a L_second and more L_dilapidated M_pillbox and it M_struck him that the L_whole L_headland had the M_desolate L_look of an L_old L_battlefield , the L_corpses L_long since L_carted L_away but the L_air M_vibrating L_still with the L_gunfire of M_long-lost L_battles , while the L_power L_station L_loomed over it like a M_grandiose M_modern M_monument to the M_unknown M_dead ."
c8t-fragment01,15,On his L_previous L_visits to L_Larksoken he had L_seen L_Martyr 's L_Cottage M_spread out beneath him when he and his L_aunt had L_stood L_surveying the L_headland from the L_small L_top L_room under the L_cone of the L_mill .
c8t-fragment01,16,"But he had L_never been L_closer to it than the L_road and now , L_driving up to it , it M_struck him again that the L_description ‘ L_cottage ’ was L_hardly L_appropriate ."
c8t-fragment01,17,"It was a L_substantial , L_two-storey , L_L-shaped L_house M_standing to the L_east of the L_track with L_walls L_partly L_flint and L_partly L_rendered , L_enclosing at the L_rear a L_courtyard of L_York L_stone which M_gave an L_uninterrupted L_view over fifty L_yards of L_scrub to the L_grassy L_dunes and the L_sea ."
c8t-fragment01,18,"No L_one L_appeared as he L_drew up and , before L_lifting his L_hand to the L_bell , he L_paused to L_read the L_words of a L_stone L_plaque L_embedded in the L_flints to the L_right of the L_door ."
c8t-fragment01,19,"In a L_cottage on this L_site L_lived L_Agnes L_Poley , L_Protestant L_martyr , L_burned at L_Ipswich , 15th L_August 1557 , L_aged 32 L_years ."
c8t-fragment01,20,"L_Ecclesiastes L_chapter 3 , L_verse 15 ."
c8t-fragment01,21,"The L_plaque was L_unadorned , the L_letters L_deeply L_carved in an L_elegant L_script L_reminiscent of L_Eric L_Gill , and L_Dalgliesh L_remembered his L_aunt L_telling him that it had been L_placed there by L_previous L_owners in the L_late L_twenties , when the L_cottage was L_originally L_extended ."
c8t-fragment01,22,One of the L_advantages of a L_religious L_education is the L_ability to L_identify at L_least the L_better-known L_texts of L_scripture and this was one which it L_needed no L_effort of L_memory to M_recall .
c8t-fragment01,23,"As a L_delinquent L_nine-year-old at his L_prep L_school , he had once been L_required by the L_headmaster to L_write out in his L_best L_handwriting the M_whole of the L_third L_chapter of L_Ecclesiastes , L_old L_Gumboil , L_economical in this as in all L_matters , L_believing that L_writing M_lines should M_combine L_punishment with L_literary and L_religious L_education ."
c8t-fragment01,24,"The L_words , in that L_round L_childish L_script , had M_remained with him ."
c8t-fragment01,25,"It was , he L_thought , an L_interesting L_choice of L_text ."
c8t-fragment01,26,That which L_hath been is now ; and that which is to be L_hath L_already been ; and L_God L_requireth that which is L_past .
c8t-fragment01,27,He L_rang and there was only a M_short L_delay before L_Alice L_Mair L_opened the L_door .
c8t-fragment01,28,"He L_saw a L_tall , L_handsome L_woman L_dressed with M_careful and L_expensive L_informality in a L_black L_cashmere L_sweater with a L_silk L_scarf at the L_throat and L_fawn L_trousers ."
c8t-fragment01,29,"He would have L_recognized her from her M_strong L_resemblance to her L_brother , although she L_looked the L_elder by some L_years ."
c8t-fragment01,30,"She M_took it for L_granted that each L_knew who the other was , and L_standing L_aside to L_motion him in she L_said : ‘ It 's L_good of you to be so L_accommodating , L_Mr L_Dalgliesh ."
c8t-fragment01,31,I 'm L_afraid L_Nora L_Gurney is L_implacable .
c8t-fragment01,32,Once she L_knew you were on your L_way to L_Norfolk you were a M_predestined M_victim .
c8t-fragment01,33,L_Perhaps you would L_bring the L_proofs through to the L_kitchen . ’
c8t-fragment01,34,"It was a L_distinguished L_face with the L_deep-set , L_widely L_spaced L_eyes beneath L_straight L_brows , a L_well-shaped , L_rather M_secretive L_mouth and L_strong L_greying L_hair M_swept L_upwards and L_curled into a L_chignon ."
c8t-fragment01,35,"In her L_publicity L_photographs she could , he M_recalled , L_look L_beautiful in a L_somewhat L_intimidating , M_intellectual and very L_English M_mould ."
c8t-fragment01,36,"But L_seen L_face to L_face , L_even in the L_informality of her own L_house , the L_absence of a M_spark of L_sexuality and , he L_sensed , a L_deep-seated L_reserve , M_made her L_seem L_less L_feminine and more L_formidable than he had L_expected , and she M_held herself M_stiffly as if M_repelling M_invaders of her L_personal M_space ."
c8t-fragment01,37,The L_handshake with which she had L_greeted him had been M_cool and L_firm and her M_brief L_smile was L_surprisingly L_attractive .
c8t-fragment01,38,"He L_knew that he was L_oversensitive to the L_timbre of the L_human L_voice and hers , although not M_jarring or L_unpleasant , L_sounded a L_little L_forced as if she were L_deliberately L_speaking at an L_unnatural L_pitch ."
c8t-fragment01,39,He L_followed her down the L_hall to the L_kitchen at the M_back of the L_house .
c8t-fragment01,40,"It was , he L_judged , L_almost twenty L_feet L_long and L_obviously M_served the L_triple L_purpose of L_sitting L_room , L_working L_place and L_office ."
c8t-fragment01,41,"The L_right-hand L_half of the L_room was a L_well-equipped L_kitchen with a L_large L_gas L_stove and an L_Aga , a L_butcher 's L_chopping L_block , a L_dresser to the L_right of the L_door M_holding an L_assortment of L_gleaming L_pots , and a L_long L_working L_surface with a L_wooden L_triangle M_sheathing her L_assortment of L_knives ."
c8t-fragment01,42,In the L_centre of the L_room was a L_large L_wooden L_table M_holding a L_stoneware L_jar of L_dried L_flowers .
c8t-fragment01,43,"On the L_left-hand L_wall was a M_working L_fireplace , the two L_recesses M_fitted with L_wall-to-ceiling L_bookshelves ."
c8t-fragment01,44,To each L_side of the L_hearth was a high-backed L_wicker L_armchair in an L_intricate L_closely L_woven L_design M_fitted with L_patchwork L_cushions .
c8t-fragment01,45,"There was an L_open L_roll-top L_desk L_facing one of the L_wide L_windows and , to its L_right , a L_stable L_door , the L_top L_half L_open , M_gave a L_view of the L_paved L_courtyard ."
c8t-fragment01,46,L_Dalgliesh could L_glimpse what was L_obviously her L_herb L_garden L_planted in L_elegant L_terracotta L_pots L_carefully L_disposed to M_catch the L_sun .
c8t-fragment01,47,"The L_room , which L_contained L_nothing L_superfluous , L_nothing L_pretentious , was both L_pleasing and L_extraordinarily L_comforting and , for a L_moment , he L_wondered why ."
c8t-fragment01,48,"Was it the M_faint L_smell of L_herbs and L_newly L_baked L_dough , the M_soft L_ticking of the M_wall-mounted L_clock which L_seemed both to M_mark the M_passing L_seconds and L_yet to M_hold L_time in L_thrall , the L_rhythmic M_moaning of the L_sea through the L_half-open L_door , the L_sense of M_well-fed L_ease M_conveyed by the two L_cushioned L_armchairs , the L_open L_hearth ?"
c8t-fragment01,49,"Or was it that the L_kitchen L_reminded L_Dalgliesh of that L_rectory L_kitchen where the L_lonely only L_child had M_found M_warmth and M_undemanding , M_uncensorious L_companionship , been L_given L_hot L_dripping L_toast and L_small L_forbidden L_treats ?"
c8t-fragment01,50,"He L_placed the L_proofs on the L_desk , L_refused L_Alice L_Mair 's L_offer of L_coffee and L_followed her M_back to the L_front L_door ."
c8t-fragment01,51,"She L_walked out with him to the L_car and L_said : ‘ I was L_sorry about your L_aunt — L_sorry for you , I L_mean ."

c8t-fragment01,55,"M_Formal L_condolences , he L_thought , were L_never L_easy to L_speak or L_accept and L_usually L_sounded either L_banal or L_insincere ."
c8t-fragment01,56,Hers had been L_perceptive .
c8t-fragment01,57,L_Jane L_Dalgliesh had L_indeed L_seemed to him L_immortal .
c8t-fragment01,58,"The very L_old , he L_thought , M_make our L_past ."
c8t-fragment01,59,Once they L_go it L_seems for a L_moment that neither it nor we have any L_real L_existence .
c8t-fragment01,60,He L_said : ‘ I do n't L_think L_death was L_ever L_terrible to her .

c8t-fragment01,69,Would you L_care to L_join us ?
c8t-fragment01,70,L_Seven thirty for eight . ’
c8t-fragment01,71,"It L_sounded , he L_thought , more like a L_challenge than an L_invitation ."
c8t-fragment01,72,"L_Somewhat to his L_surprise , L_Dalgliesh M_found himself L_accepting ."
c8t-fragment01,73,But then the M_whole L_encounter had been a L_little L_surprising .
c8t-fragment01,74,She L_stood L_regarding him with a M_serious L_intensity as he L_let in the L_clutch and L_turned the L_car and he had the M_impression that she was L_watching L_critically to L_see how he M_handled it .
c8t-fragment01,75,"But at L_least , he L_thought as he M_gave a L_final L_wave , she had n't L_asked him whether he had L_come to L_Norfolk to L_help L_catch the L_Whistler ."
c8t-fragment01,76,Three L_minutes L_later he L_raised his L_foot from the L_accelerator .
c8t-fragment01,77,"L_Ahead of him , L_trudging L_along on the L_left of the L_path , was a L_little L_group of L_children , the L_eldest L_girl L_wheeling a L_pushchair with two L_smaller L_children , one each L_side of her , L_clutching the L_bars ."
c8t-fragment01,78,"L_Hearing the L_noise of the L_car she L_turned and he L_saw a M_peaked , L_delicate L_face M_framed with M_red-gold L_hair ."
c8t-fragment01,79,"He L_recognized the L_Blaney L_children , L_met once before with their L_mother L_walking along the L_beach ."
c8t-fragment01,80,L_Obviously the L_eldest L_girl had been L_shopping : the L_folding L_pushchair had a L_shelf under the L_seat L_lumped L_high with L_plastic L_bags .
c8t-fragment01,81,L_Instinctively he L_slowed down .
c8t-fragment01,82,"They were L_unlikely to be in L_real L_danger , the L_Whistler L_stalked at L_night , not in M_broad L_daylight , and no L_vehicle had L_passed him since he L_left the L_coastal L_road ."
c8t-fragment01,83,But the L_child L_looked L_grossly L_overburdened and ought not to be so L_far from L_home .
c8t-fragment01,84,Though he had L_never L_seen their L_cottage he L_seemed to L_remember that his L_aunt had L_told him that it M_lay about two L_miles to the L_south .
c8t-fragment01,85,"He M_recalled what he L_knew about them , that their L_father L_earned a M_precarious L_living as a L_painter whose L_innocuous , L_prettified L_watercolours were L_sold in cafés and L_tourist L_shops along the L_coast and that their L_mother had been L_desperately L_ill with L_cancer ."
c8t-fragment01,86,He L_wondered whether L_Mrs L_Blaney was L_still L_alive .
c8t-fragment01,87,"His L_instinct was to L_pile the L_children into the L_car and L_drive them L_home but that , he L_knew , was L_hardly L_sensible ."
c8t-fragment01,88,"L_Almost L_certainly the L_eldest L_child — L_Theresa , was n't it ? — had been L_taught not to L_accept L_lifts from L_strangers , L_particularly L_men , and he was L_virtually a L_stranger ."
c8t-fragment01,89,On an M_impulse he L_reversed the L_Jaguar and L_drove L_quickly M_back to L_Martyr 's L_Cottage .
c8t-fragment01,90,This L_time the L_front L_door was L_open and a M_swathe of L_sunlight M_lay across the L_red-tiled L_floor .
c8t-fragment01,91,"L_Alice L_Mair had L_heard the L_car and L_came out to him from the L_kitchen , L_wiping her L_hands ."
c8t-fragment01,92,He L_said : ‘ The L_Blaney L_children are L_walking L_home .
c8t-fragment01,93,L_Theresa is L_wheeling a L_pushchair and L_trying to L_cope with the L_twins .
c8t-fragment01,94,"I L_thought I could L_offer a L_lift if I had a L_woman with me , L_someone they L_know . ’"
c8t-fragment01,95,She L_said L_briefly : ‘ They L_know me . ’
c8t-fragment01,96,"Without another L_word she L_went L_back into the L_kitchen then L_came out to him , L_closed the L_front L_door after her without L_locking it and L_got into the L_car ."
c8t-fragment01,97,"L_Putting it into L_gear , his L_arm M_brushed her L_knee ."
c8t-fragment01,98,"He was L_aware of an L_almost L_imperceptible M_withdrawing , more L_emotional than L_physical , a M_small M_delicate L_gesture of M_self-containment ."
c8t-fragment01,99,"L_Dalgliesh L_doubted whether that M_half-imagined L_recoil had L_anything to do with him L_personally , nor did he M_find her L_silence L_disconcerting ."
c8t-fragment01,100,"Their L_conversation , when they did L_speak , was M_brief ."
c8t-fragment01,101,He L_asked : ‘ Is L_Mrs L_Blaney L_still L_alive ? ’
c8t-fragment01,102,‘ No .
c8t-fragment01,103,She L_died six L_weeks L_ago . ’
c8t-fragment01,104,‘ How are they M_managing ? ’
c8t-fragment01,105,"‘ Not L_particularly L_well , I L_imagine ."
c8t-fragment01,106,But L_Ryan L_Blaney does n't M_welcome M_interference .
c8t-fragment01,107,I L_sympathize .
c8t-fragment01,108,"Once he M_lets down his M_defences half the L_social L_workers in L_Norfolk , L_amateur and L_professional , will M_move in on him . ’"
c8t-fragment01,109,When they L_drew up beside the L_little L_band it was L_Alice L_Mair who L_opened the L_car L_door and L_spoke .
c8t-fragment01,110,"‘ L_Theresa , here is L_Mr L_Dalgliesh to M_give you all a L_lift ."
c8t-fragment01,111,He 's L_Miss L_Dalgliesh 's L_nephew from L_Larksoken L_Mill .
c8t-fragment01,112,One of the L_twins had L_better L_sit on my L_lap .
c8t-fragment01,113,The L_rest of you and the L_pushchair can L_fit into the M_back . ’
c8t-fragment01,114,L_Theresa L_looked at L_Dalgliesh without L_smiling and L_said a L_grave L_thank you .
c8t-fragment01,115,"She L_reminded him of L_pictures of the L_young L_Elizabeth L_Tudor , the same M_red-gold L_hair M_framing a L_curiously L_adult L_face both M_secretive and L_self-composed , the same M_sharp L_nose and M_wary L_eyes ."
c8t-fragment01,116,"The L_faces of the L_twins , M_softer M_editions of her own , M_turned towards her L_questioningly then M_broke into M_shy L_smiles ."
c8t-fragment01,117,"They L_looked as if they had been L_dressed in a L_hurry and not very L_suitably for a M_long L_walk on the L_headland , L_even in a L_warm L_autumn ."
c8t-fragment01,118,"One L_wore a L_tattered L_summer L_dress in L_pink L_spotted L_cotton with L_double L_flounces , the other a L_pinafore over a L_checked L_blouse ."
c8t-fragment01,119,Their L_pathetically L_thin L_legs were L_unprotected .
c8t-fragment01,120,L_Theresa was L_wearing L_jeans and a L_grubby L_sweat L_shirt with a L_map of L_London 's L_Underground across the L_front .
c8t-fragment01,121,L_Dalgliesh M_found himself L_wondering if it had been L_brought L_back from a L_school L_trip to the L_capital .
c8t-fragment01,122,It was too L_large for her and the L_wide L_sleeves of L_limp L_cotton L_hung from her L_freckled L_arms like M_rags M_thrown over a M_stick .
c8t-fragment01,123,"In M_contrast to his L_sisters , L_Anthony was over-clad , a L_bundle of L_leggings , L_jumper and a L_padded L_jacket L_topped with a L_woollen L_helmet with a L_bobble L_pulled L_well down over his L_forehead , beneath which he L_surveyed their L_busyness , L_unsmiling , like a M_stout M_imperious M_Caesar ."
c8t-fragment01,124,"L_Dalgliesh L_got out of the L_Jaguar and L_tried to L_extricate him from the L_pushchair , but the M_anatomy of the L_chair L_momentarily M_defeated him ."
c8t-fragment01,125,There was a L_bar beneath which the L_child 's L_rigid L_legs were M_obstinately L_stuck .
c8t-fragment01,126,The M_solid M_uncooperative L_bundle was L_surprisingly L_heavy ; it was like M_trying to M_manoeuvre a M_firm and L_rather M_smelly M_poultice .
c8t-fragment01,127,"L_Theresa M_gave him a M_brief , L_pitying L_smile , L_dragged the L_plastic L_bags from beneath the L_seat then L_expertly L_freed her L_brother and L_settled him on her L_left L_hip while , with the other L_hand , she M_collapsed the L_pushchair , with a L_single L_vigorous L_shake ."
c8t-fragment01,128,"L_Dalgliesh L_took the L_baby from her while L_Theresa L_helped the L_children into the L_Jaguar and M_commanded with L_sudden L_fierceness , ‘ L_Sit L_still . ’"
c8t-fragment01,129,"L_Anthony , L_recognizing L_incompetence , L_grasped L_Dalgliesh 's L_hair L_firmly with a L_sticky L_hand and he L_felt the L_momentary L_touch of a L_cheek , so L_soft that it was like the M_fall of a M_petal ."
c8t-fragment01,130,Throughout these L_manoeuvrings L_Alice L_Mair L_sat L_quietly L_watching from the L_car but L_made no L_move to L_help .
c8t-fragment01,131,It was L_impossible to L_know what she was L_thinking .
c8t-fragment01,132,But once the L_Jaguar had L_moved L_away she L_turned to L_Theresa and L_said in a L_voice of L_surprising L_gentleness : ‘ Does your L_father L_know that you 're out L_alone ? ’
c8t-fragment01,133,‘ L_Daddy has L_taken the L_van to L_Mr L_Sparks .
c8t-fragment01,134,It 's L_due for its L_MOT L_test .
c8t-fragment01,135,L_Mr L_Sparks does n't L_think it 's L_going to M_pass .
c8t-fragment01,136,And I M_found we 'd M_run out of L_milk for L_Anthony .
c8t-fragment01,137,We have to have L_milk .
c8t-fragment01,138,And we L_wanted some more L_disposable L_nappies . ’
c8t-fragment01,139,L_Alice L_Mair L_said : ‘ I 'm M_giving a L_dinner L_party on L_Thursday L_evening .
c8t-fragment01,140,"If your L_father L_agrees , would you L_like to L_come and L_help with the L_table like you did L_last L_month ? ’"
c8t-fragment01,141,"‘ What are you L_going to L_cook , L_Miss L_Mair ? ‘"
c8t-fragment01,142,‘ L_Put your L_head L_close so that I can L_whisper .
c8t-fragment01,143,L_Mr L_Dalgliesh is L_going to be one of the L_guests .
c8t-fragment01,144,I L_want it to be a L_surprise . ‘
c8t-fragment01,145,The L_pale M_golden L_head L_leaned L_forward towards the L_grey and L_Miss L_Mair L_whispered .
c8t-fragment01,146,L_Theresa L_smiled and then L_nodded with L_serious L_satisfaction in a L_moment of L_grave L_feminine L_conspiracy .
cb5-fragment02,3183,"But M_next L_morning L_Ruth L_awakened L_early and , L_leaving L_Miss L_Beard to her M_gentle L_dreams , L_dressed L_quickly and L_hurried out of the L_house ."
cb5-fragment02,3184,It was another M_golden L_day .
cb5-fragment02,3185,"She L_still M_retained her L_English M_habit of M_noting each L_day 's L_weather , L_always L_expecting L_changes , L_marvelling at the L_hot L_sunny L_days which M_followed one after the other , L_almost with L_monotony ."
fef-fragment03,710,And that M_brings us to the L_ext L_example .
fef-fragment03,711,"3.3 M_Pinch L_effect ( J , H , B )"
fef-fragment03,712,"In M_contrast to our L_previous L_example we shall now M_investigate a L_cylindrical M_beam L_consisting of two L_kinds of M_charge M_carriers : M_negative L_electrons and some M_positive L_particles , which I do not L_wish to be more L_precise about at the L_moment ."
fef-fragment03,713,We shall M_assume that the two L_kinds of L_particles have L_equal M_densities and L_move in M_opposite L_directions .
fef-fragment03,714,As a L_result there is no L_net L_space M_charge and L_hence no L_electric M_field .
fef-fragment03,715,"The M_currents , on the other M_hand , do not M_cancel because they L_represent M_opposite M_charges L_moving in M_opposite L_directions ( L_remember , minus one L_times L_minus one is L_equal to plus one ) ."
fef-fragment03,716,The L_magnetic M_field M_strength is M_given again by L_eqn ( 3.27 ) ; we only L_need to M_substitute for the M_current In + L_Ip where the L_subscripts n and p M_refer to M_negative and M_positive L_particles L_respectively .
fef-fragment03,717,"L_Hence the L_magnetic M_force on the L_electron at the L_edge of the M_beam ( at R = a ) is M_formula] , and on the M_positive L_particle is M_formula] ."
fef-fragment03,718,"L_Note that the M_force is L_inwards , and in the same L_direction for both L_particles ."
fef-fragment03,719,L_Let us L_distinguish two L_cases .
fef-fragment03,720,Both L_particles are L_mobile
fef-fragment03,721,In that L_case both of them will L_move L_inwards under the L_effect of L_magnetic M_force .
fef-fragment03,722,"But if the L_diameter of the M_beam is L_reduced , L_eqns ( 3.33 ) and ( 3.34 ) M_tell us that the M_forces are L_even M_larger ."
fef-fragment03,723,What L_happens then ?
fef-fragment03,724,If L_everything was L_uniform then the M_beam L_diameter would M_go on L_decreasing .
fef-fragment03,725,In L_practice L_however the M_beam is not L_uniform and does not M_possess L_perfect L_cylindrical L_symmetry .
fef-fragment03,726,"Under these L_conditions the L_motion of the L_particles is L_fairly L_complicated , and of L_course our L_model is L_unable to M_predict the L_detailed M_behaviour of the L_particles ."
fef-fragment03,727,L_Nevertheless a few L_qualitative L_conclusions may be M_drawn without doing any further L_mathematics .
fef-fragment03,728,"If the L_cross-section L_happens to be L_smaller at a L_certain L_place , then the M_forces are M_larger there than at the L_neighbouring L_cross-sections , so the M_beam will be further L_constricted , etc. , M_leading to the L_so-called M_sausage L_instability ( Fig. 3.3(a) ) ."
fef-fragment03,729,"If the L_magnetic M_field L_happens to be L_larger at one L_side than at the other L_side , then the M_beam will be L_deflected towards the M_weaker M_field which M_makes the M_field L_even M_weaker , etc. , M_leading to the L_so-called M_kink L_instability ( Fig. 3.3(b) ) ."
fef-fragment03,730,The M_positive L_particle is L_immobile
fef-fragment03,731,In L_practice this L_means that the M_positive L_ions are L_part of the L_crystal M_lattice .
fef-fragment03,732,"There is then no L_magnetic M_force on the L_ions , only on the L_electrons ."
fef-fragment03,733,So the L_electrons M_want to L_move L_inwards but can not because the L_ions M_hold them M_back by M_virtue of their L_electrostatic L_attraction .
fef-fragment03,734,"L_Naturally , if the L_ions L_attract the L_electrons the L_converse is L_true as L_well , i.e. L_owing to the L_magnetic M_force on the L_electrons , there is L_also an L_inward M_force upon the L_ions ."
fef-fragment03,735,So the L_whole L_crystal L_structure M_tries to L_contract or in other L_words the L_material is under L_pressure ( L_see L_Example 3.2 ) .
fef-fragment03,736,In any L_practical L_situation this L_pressure is M_small and can be L_neglected when L_calculating the M_forces on M_current-carrying M_conductors .
fef-fragment03,737,3.4 .
fef-fragment03,738,"M_Flow M_patterns and L_Ohm 's M_law ( J , E , D )"
fef-fragment03,739,Up to now we have not L_enquired into the L_question of how the M_current M_arose .
fef-fragment03,740,We just M_assumed that L_certain M_charge M_carriers L_moved with L_certain L_velocities .
fef-fragment03,741,"Now we shall M_say that in a L_class of L_materials the M_current M_density at any L_point is L_proportional to the L_electric M_field ; in L_mathematical M_form M_formula] , where M_formula] is the L_conductivity of the L_material ."
fef-fragment03,742,The above L_equation is L_spite of its L_utmost L_simplicity L_represents an L_extremely M_good L_guess .
fef-fragment03,743,It is L_valid for L_nearly all L_materials up to L_quite M_high L_electric M_fields .
fef-fragment03,744,Will there be a L_magnetic M_field ?
fef-fragment03,745,"L_Yes , of L_course , whenever there is a M_current there is a L_magnetic M_field as L_well ."
fef-fragment03,746,But the L_effect of the L_magnetic M_field upon the L_motion of the L_electrons is L_nearly L_always L_negligible ( one L_exception L_causing the M_pinch L_effect is L_mentioned in the L_previous M_section ) .
fef-fragment03,747,L_Thus we may M_safely L_ignore the L_magnetic M_field when M_determining the M_lines of M_current M_flow .
fef-fragment03,748,"We are then M_left with only one L_equation M_formula] or M_formula] or M_formula] , L_depending on our L_preference ."
fef-fragment03,749,L_Eqn ( 3.38 ) M_tells us that there is some L_analogy ( L_see L_Example 3.3 ) with the L_electrostatic L_case L_treated in L_Chapter 2 .
fef-fragment03,750,"We may , in L_fact , L_reinterpret any of the L_diagrams of L_Figs ( 2.25 ) -(2.31) by M_assuming that the L_whole L_space is L_filled with a L_material of L_conductivity M_formula] and the M_field M_lines are now the M_lines of M_current M_flow as L_well ."
fef-fragment03,751,Is the L_analogy L_perfect ?
fef-fragment03,752,"Not L_really , because ( 1 ) as M_current M_flows there is some M_potential M_drop in the L_electrode itself , ( 2 ) L_zero L_conductivity for M_part of the L_space can not be L_electrostatically L_modelled since there are no L_dielectrics with L_Er = 0 , and ( 3 ) when M_current M_flows through two L_materials of L_different L_conductivity there is L_generally a L_surface M_charge at the L_boundary ( L_see L_Example 3.4 ) ."
fef-fragment03,753,It is not M_worth L_discussing any of these L_complications because one is L_rarely M_called upon to L_work out M_lines of M_current in a M_conductor .
fef-fragment03,754,We shall L_rather M_return to a very M_simple L_geometrical L_configuration for M_deriving L_Ohm 's M_law .
fef-fragment03,755,We shall L_take a L_piece of L_cylindrical L_material of L_length l and L_cross-section S and M_apply a L_voltage between the L_ends .
fef-fragment03,756,"The L_electric M_field is then M_formula] , the M_current M_density M_formula] , and the M_current M_formula] ."
fef-fragment03,757,"From M_circuit L_theory M_formula] , where R is the M_resistance of the L_material ."
fef-fragment03,758,L_Comparing L_eqns ( 3.41 ) and ( 3.42 ) we M_get M_formula] .
fef-fragment03,759,Since M_formula] is by L_definition the L_resistivity we M_get the L_result you L_learned in L_school that the L_electrical M_resistance is L_proportional to the L_resistivity and the L_length of the L_sample and L_inversely L_proportional to its L_cross-section .
fef-fragment03,760,"A more L_general L_definition of M_resistance L_valid for L_varying L_cross-sections may be L_easily M_arrived at , but it is L_hardly M_worth the M_trouble ."
fef-fragment03,761,The L_essential L_thing is that the L_relation M_formula] is L_equivalent to L_Ohm 's M_law .
fef-fragment03,762,"M_Risking the L_dismay of M_circuit L_engineers some L_theoreticians do , in L_fact , M_refer to L_eqn ( 3.35 ) as L_Ohm 's M_law ."

fet-fragment01,3,"He L_signed the L_Friends ' L_Book in his L_elegant L_handwriting : L_Alexander L_Wedderburn , L_January 22nd , 1980 ."
fet-fragment01,4,"She had L_said , L_peremptory as L_always , that he was to L_go M_straight to L_Room L_III , where "" the L_miraculous L_stuff "" was to be L_found ."
fet-fragment01,5,L_Early .
fet-fragment01,6,"So here he was , a L_distinguished L_public L_man , L_also an L_artist of a L_kind , L_stepping L_obediently through L_Room I ( L_French 1880s ) and L_Room II ( L_British 1880s and 1890s ) , on a M_lead M_grey L_morning , to the M_pale L_grey , L_classical , M_quiet L_place where the L_bright L_light L_shone and M_sang off L_pigment so that the L_phrase , L_miraculous L_stuff , L_seemed L_merely M_accurate ."
fet-fragment01,7,"On one L_long L_wall L_hung a L_row of L_Van L_Goghs , L_including an L_Arles "" L_Poets ' L_Garden "" he had n't L_seen before , but L_recognised , from L_small L_photographs , from L_charged L_descriptions in the L_painter 's L_letters ."
fet-fragment01,8,"He L_sat down and L_saw a L_bifurcated L_path , M_simmering with M_gold L_heat L_round and under the L_rising , M_spreading L_blue-black-green M_down-pointing M_vanes of a L_great L_pine , L_still L_widening where the L_frame L_interrupted its M_soaring ."
fet-fragment01,9,"Two L_decorous L_figures L_advanced , L_hand-in-hand , under its L_suspended L_thickness ."
fet-fragment01,10,"And beyond , L_green L_grass and L_geraniums like M_splashes of M_blood ."
fet-fragment01,11,L_Alexander was not L_worried about whether L_Frederica would L_turn up .
fet-fragment01,12,"She was no L_longer in the M_habit of being L_late : her L_life had M_schooled her to L_temporal L_accuracy , L_perhaps to being L_considerate ."
fet-fragment01,13,"He himself , at sixty-two , M_felt , not L_quite M_accurately , that he was now too L_old , too L_settled , to be M_put out , by her or by L_anyone L_else ."
fet-fragment01,14,He L_thought with M_warmth of her L_certain M_approach .
fet-fragment01,15,"There had been a M_pattern , an only too L_discernible L_repetition in the L_events and L_relationships of his L_life into which she had M_ruggedly L_refused to M_fit ."
fet-fragment01,16,"She had been a L_nuisance , a L_threat , a L_torment and was now a L_friend ."
fet-fragment01,17,"She had L_suggested that they L_look at L_Van L_Gogh L_together , M_setting up another M_form of L_repetition , L_deliberate , L_contrived and L_aesthetic ."
fet-fragment01,18,"His L_play , The L_Yellow L_Chair , had L_first been M_presented in 1957 ; he did not L_like to L_think too M_closely about it , as he did not L_like to L_think too M_closely about any of his L_past L_work ."
fet-fragment01,19,"He L_stared at the L_serenely L_impassioned L_garden L_made out of a L_whirl of L_yellow L_brushstrokes , a L_viridian L_impasto , a L_dense L_mass of M_furiously M_feathered M_lines of L_blue-green , L_isolated L_black L_pot L_hooks , the M_painfully M_clear L_orange-red L_spattering ."
fet-fragment01,20,He had L_trouble M_finding an L_appropriate L_language for the L_painter 's L_obsession with the M_illuminated L_material M_world .
fet-fragment01,21,"He would have been L_lying if he had L_recorded only the more M_accessible M_drama of the L_painter 's M_electric L_quarrels with L_Gauguin in the L_Yellow L_House in L_Arles , the L_distant L_necessary L_brother who L_supplied L_paint and L_love , the L_severed L_ear L_delivered to the L_whore in the L_brothel , the L_asylum L_fears ."
fet-fragment01,22,"At L_first he had L_thought that he could L_write a M_plain , L_exact L_verse with no L_figurative L_language , in which a L_yellow L_chair was the L_thing itself , a L_yellow L_chair , as a L_round M_gold L_apple was an L_apple or a L_sunflower a L_sunflower ."
fet-fragment01,23,"L_Sometimes he L_still M_saw the L_brushstrokes , as it were , in this M_naked M_way , so that his L_earlier L_thoughts of this L_garden had to be M_undone , the L_idea of L_black L_wings to be M_stripped from the L_painted L_leafage , the L_vulgar L_idea of L_blood L_splashes M_washed off the L_notation of L_geraniums ."
fet-fragment01,24,But it could n't be done .
fet-fragment01,25,"L_Language was against him , for a M_start ."
fet-fragment01,26,"L_Metaphor M_lay M_coiled in the L_name L_sunflower , which not only L_turned towards but L_resembled the L_sun , the M_source of L_light ."
fet-fragment01,27,L_Van L_Gogh 's L_idea of M_things had L_also been against him .
fet-fragment01,28,"The L_yellow L_chair , besides being L_brushstrokes and L_pigment , besides being a L_yellow L_chair , was one of twelve L_bought for a L_company of L_artists who were to L_inhabit the L_Yellow L_House , the L_white L_walls of which should M_blaze with L_sunflowers as the L_windows of L_Gothic L_cathedrals M_blazed with L_coloured L_light ."
fet-fragment01,29,"Not only L_metaphor : L_cultural M_motif , L_immanent L_religion , a L_faith and a L_church ."
fet-fragment01,30,One M_thing L_always M_linked to another M_thing .
fet-fragment01,31,"As the L_Poets ' L_Garden , a L_decoration for the L_bedroom of the "" L_poet L_Gauguin "" was more than it L_seemed ."
fet-fragment01,32,"Some L_time L_ago I L_read an L_article on L_Dante , L_Petrarch , L_Boccaccio and L_Botticelli ."
fet-fragment01,33,"L_Good L_Lord ! it did M_make an M_impression on me , L_reading the L_letters of those L_men ."
fet-fragment01,34,"L_Arles , 1888 ."
fet-fragment01,35,"And L_Petrarch L_lived L_quite L_near here in L_Avignon , and I am L_seeing the same L_cypresses and L_oleanders …"
fet-fragment01,36,"There is L_still a M_great M_deal of L_Greece all through the L_Tartarin and L_Daumier L_part of this M_queer L_country , where the L_good L_folks have the L_accent you L_know ; there is a L_Venus of L_Arles just as there is a L_Venus of L_Lesbos and one L_still M_feels the M_youth of it , in L_spite of all …"
fet-fragment01,37,"But is n't it M_true , this L_garden has a M_fantastic M_character which M_makes you L_quite L_able to L_imagine the L_poets of the L_Renaissance L_strolling among these L_bushes and over the L_flowery L_grass ? …"
fet-fragment01,38,"The M_youth of it , L_Alexander L_thought ."
fet-fragment01,39,I L_thought I was L_world-weary then .
fet-fragment01,40,"In L_July 1890 , two L_years after L_writing this , L_Van L_Gogh had L_shot himself L_inefficiently in the L_groin , and had L_died L_slowly ."
fet-fragment01,41,"In 1954 L_Alexander , a L_time-obsessed L_man , had L_read the L_centenary L_edition ( 1953 ) of the L_Letters ."
fet-fragment01,42,"He had himself been M_rising thirty-seven and when The L_Yellow L_Chair was M_put on had M_passed that L_age , was L_older now than L_Van L_Gogh , as he had , in the 1940s , L_realised that he was L_older than L_Keats ."
fet-fragment01,43,"He had M_felt , L_perhaps , L_briefly , the M_power of the M_survivor ."
fet-fragment01,44,What L_nonsense .
fet-fragment01,45,The L_eternal M_youth of L_Provence .
fet-fragment01,46,"He L_thought of L_thick , M_fat , L_hot L_motorways M_carving up that L_land ."
fet-fragment01,47,He M_turned his L_attention to the L_timeless L_fields of L_wheat and L_olives .
fet-fragment01,48,She M_made a L_kind of L_progress up the L_Palladian L_marble L_stair .
fet-fragment01,49,A L_painter L_stopped to L_kiss her : a L_journalist L_waved .
fet-fragment01,50,"L_John L_House , who had L_organised the L_exhibition , L_came L_almost L_leaping down the L_stairs L_accompanied by a L_smallish L_woman in a L_pine-green M_tent-like L_coat ."
fet-fragment01,51,"He L_also L_kissed L_Frederica and L_introduced the L_woman , M_fumbling her L_name , as "" a L_colleague "" and L_Frederica as "" L_Frederica — you must L_forgive me , I L_never L_know what L_name you L_re L_working under , L_women these L_days are so L_protean . """

fet-fragment01,53,She M_assumed L_wrongly that L_John L_House 's L_colleague was an L_art L_historian .

fpb-fragment01,1170,"L_Flying was L_even L_better than she had L_hoped : L_better than L_skiing , L_better than L_driving a L_sports L_car ."

fpb-fragment01,1205,L_Buzz L_never L_cheated to L_let L_Elinor L_win : she L_knew that L_Elinor would L_immediately L_sense this and M_feel L_humiliated .
fpb-fragment01,1206,"After an L_intensive L_rehabilitation L_programme of L_physiotherapy and L_speech L_therapy , L_Elinor L_appeared to have L_completely L_recovered from her M_stroke , although she could no L_longer L_think of three M_things at once , which L_Buzz L_said was a L_mercy for the L_people who had to L_live with her ."
fpb-fragment01,1207,"L_Elinor was L_sometimes at a M_loss for the L_right L_word , or L_name , and then L_became L_impatient with herself ; she was L_often L_frustrated because she could n't L_move as L_swiftly as she did before ."

fpb-fragment01,1373,"‘ L_Let's not L_argue about L_something that L_happened over thirty L_years L_ago , ’ L_Adam L_said L_finally ."

fpb-fragment01,1379,"L_Annabel was L_determined to M_get a M_grip on herself and do as L_Scott L_advised : L_remember 1965 as the L_year she L_stopped having to L_go to L_auditions and 1966 as the L_year in which she M_blossomed into a L_successful L_young L_New L_York L_hostess as she L_met L_Andy L_Warhol , L_Lenny L_Bernstein , L_Baby L_Jane L_Holzer , and all the other L_gossip-columnist M_fodder ."

g0l-fragment01,3,L_Sorge had L_never been to L_Langley before .

g0l-fragment01,6,‘ Why L_Langley ? ’
g0l-fragment01,7,L_Sorge had L_asked him on the L_way out of L_Washington .
g0l-fragment01,8,‘ They L_want to M_show you that they L_trust you . ’
g0l-fragment01,9,‘ I do n't L_expect I 'll L_see L_much . ’

g0l-fragment01,16,‘ L_Welcome to L_Langley . ’
g0l-fragment01,17,He L_held his L_hand out in L_welcome .
g0l-fragment01,18,"When the L_introductions were L_complete , the L_Exec L_Director , the L_DDA , the L_DDI , L_Sorge and L_Nowak L_settled themselves L_round the L_small L_conference L_table ."
g0l-fragment01,19,"‘ We have a M_new L_problem , ’ M_kicked off the L_Exec L_Director ."
g0l-fragment01,20,‘ The L_English L_operative who was L_guarding L_Trimmler has L_taken off .

g0l-fragment01,26,‘ I do n't L_know L_yet .
g0l-fragment01,27,What about L_Goodenache ? ’
g0l-fragment01,28,He L_decided to M_turn the M_pressure on the L_Russian .

g0l-fragment01,32,‘ Are the L_German L_authorities M_involved ? ’
g0l-fragment01,33,‘ No .
g0l-fragment01,34,We have our own M_means . ’
g0l-fragment01,35,"L_Sorge L_saw the L_Exec L_Director L_look up , his L_eyebrows M_raised L_suddenly ."
g0l-fragment01,36,‘ We both have our L_methods .
g0l-fragment01,37,L_Even in an L_independent L_Germany .
g0l-fragment01,38,"After all , it was the L_death of our L_people in these M_situations that has M_brought us L_together . ’"
g0l-fragment01,39,The L_Exec L_Director L_shrugged .
g0l-fragment01,40,M_Bastard L_Russians were L_still upto their M_old M_tricks .
g0l-fragment01,41,He L_ignored the M_pointed L_look the L_DDI was M_giving him .
g0l-fragment01,42,‘ I L_thought it L_best if the L_Director of our L_operations in L_New L_Orleans M_gave you a L_run down of what has M_taken M_place up to now . ’
g0l-fragment01,43,"He L_sat L_back and L_let the L_DDA M_give a M_full L_report , L_including the M_trip to the L_voodoo L_ceremony and all that M_followed ."
g0l-fragment01,44,"L_Sorge did n't L_stir , L_even when they L_mentioned the L_gruesome L_spectacle of L_Trimmler 's L_arms M_folded in the L_sign of a L_swastika ."
g0l-fragment01,45,‘ We L_still are n't L_convinced that L_Trimmler 's L_death has L_anything to do with the L_death of our L_agents .
g0l-fragment01,46,There 's no L_definite M_link . ’
g0l-fragment01,47,‘ The M_situation might be M_clearer when I 've L_finished . ’
g0l-fragment01,48,"L_Sorge L_looked L_round the L_table , L_saw their L_undisguised L_curiosity ."
g0l-fragment01,49,"‘ In 1942 , in L_Germany , we had a L_GRU M_network L_named the L_Rote L_Kapelle … ’"
g0l-fragment01,50,‘ What 's that ? ’ L_asked the L_Exec L_Director .
g0l-fragment01,51,‘ L_Red M_Orchestra .
g0l-fragment01,52,The L_Nazis L_called it that because we had L_radio L_operators we L_code-named L_musicians .
g0l-fragment01,53,"Their L_leader , the L_Chef , we L_called him , was L_Leopold L_Trepper ."
g0l-fragment01,54,"It was this L_group that L_radioed the L_warning of L_Operation L_Blue , the L_attack on L_Stalingrad that M_led to L_Hitler 's M_biggest L_wartime L_disaster on the L_Russian M_Front . ’"
g0l-fragment01,55,‘ Who was M_feeding you all this L_information in L_Germany ? ’ L_asked the L_Exec L_Director .
g0l-fragment01,56,‘ L_High-ranking L_officials .
g0l-fragment01,57,Both in the L_military and in the L_Government .
g0l-fragment01,58,They M_saw the M_damage L_Hitler was doing .
g0l-fragment01,59,"They did n't L_disagree with his M_aims , only his L_methods ."
g0l-fragment01,60,"When they M_saw that the L_war could not be L_won , L_even as L_early as 1941 , some of them M_opened up M_lines of L_communication with us and the L_British . ’"
g0l-fragment01,61,"‘ We did n't M_get that L_sort of M_stuff till L_late into 1944 , ’ L_said the L_DDA ."
g0l-fragment01,62,‘ You were n't L_Europeans .
g0l-fragment01,63,We had L_centuries of M_contacts to L_fall L_back on .
g0l-fragment01,64,"For all their L_bravery and L_resourcefulness , their L_information was L_often L_wasted , because L_Stalin did n't L_believe them ."
g0l-fragment01,65,"But then , he M_found it L_difficult to L_believe L_anyone ."
g0l-fragment01,66,"The L_Germans , with more M_sophisticated L_radio-tracking L_equipment , L_started to L_track down the M_musicians ."
g0l-fragment01,67,L_Even L_Trepper was L_captured and the L_Rote L_Kapelle was L_wound up at the M_end of 1942 .
g0l-fragment01,68,"Our L_information L_continued for a while , but it was of M_doubtful L_origin ."
g0l-fragment01,69,"L_Trepper was L_interrogated by the L_Gestapo and we L_believed he L_became a M_double L_agent , a M_lot of L_misinformation was L_received in L_Moscow . ’"
g0l-fragment01,70,L_Sorge L_leant across and L_finished his L_coffee before L_continuing .
g0l-fragment01,71,‘ But we L_still L_needed L_information .
g0l-fragment01,72,The L_overall M_network with M_sources inside L_Germany was the L_Rote L_Drei . ’
g0l-fragment01,73,"‘ The L_Red what ? ’ L_said the L_Exec L_Director , L_pleased that he had L_deciphered the L_first L_word of the M_new L_code-name ."
g0l-fragment01,74,‘ L_Three .
g0l-fragment01,75,The L_Red L_Three .
g0l-fragment01,76,L_Based in L_Switzerland and L_named after the three L_transmitters that they L_used .
g0l-fragment01,77,"The most L_important M_source of L_information , from L_agents inside L_Germany , was from a L_group under L_Rudolf L_Roessler ."
g0l-fragment01,78,"His L_code-name was M_Lucy and his M_network , the M_Lucy M_Ring ."
g0l-fragment01,79,"L_Roessler , or L_Lucy , was a L_Swiss L_Intelligence L_Officer of L_German L_extraction ."
g0l-fragment01,80,He had L_many M_contacts in L_Germany .
g0l-fragment01,81,"L_Lucy 's four M_main M_contacts were L_Major L_General L_Oster who was the M_head of the L_Abwehr ; L_Admiral L_Canaris who was L_later L_hanged for his M_part in the 1944 L_bomb M_plot ; L_Carl L_Goehdeler who was L_leader of the L_official L_opposition to L_Hitler ; and L_Colonel L_Boetzel , the L_commanding L_officer of L_Intelligence L_Evaluation ."
g0l-fragment01,82,"There were L_others , but L_Lucy L_never M_disclosed any of them to us . ’"
g0l-fragment01,83,‘ L_Even after the L_war ? ’ L_asked the L_DDI .
g0l-fragment01,84,"‘ The L_Lucy L_Ring was L_disbanded in 1943 , after being M_responsible for some L_invaluable L_work ."
g0l-fragment01,85,"I wo n't M_go through all their L_successes , but it was M_substantial ."
g0l-fragment01,86,The L_British were L_involved with them through us and it was their L_advanced L_work on M_breaking L_cyphers that L_enabled the M_ring to L_establish such a M_great L_record .

kbc-fragment13,6182,the M_bloody M_hell do you have to do !
kbc-fragment13,6183,That 's L_incredible that !
kbc-fragment13,6184,M_See they L_say it was a it 's L_hereditary .
kbc-fragment13,6185,L_Well
kbc-fragment13,6186,L_Cos his L_father had a L_bypass did n't he ?
kbc-fragment13,6187,Oh did he ?
kbc-fragment13,6188,I L_think some other L_relative L_died L_er
kbc-fragment13,6189,Oh .
kbc-fragment13,6190,L_youngish .
kbc-fragment13,6191,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6192,"Oh L_well I M_bet , I L_think L_perhaps it is L_really ."
kbc-fragment13,6193,I L_know .
kbc-fragment13,6194,It 's L_still M_going ?
kbc-fragment13,6195,I L_know .
kbc-fragment13,6196,"Yeah , and you ca n't , you ca n't L_understand it can you L_really ?"
kbc-fragment13,6197,L_Well M_look at the L_old L_lady that L_walks L_past here at ninety one !
kbc-fragment13,6198,"That 's L_right , L_yeah ."
kbc-fragment13,6199,Yeah .
kbc-fragment13,6200,And she does all her own L_shopping .
kbc-fragment13,6201,L_Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6202,"You L_know , I L_mean , she L_keeps L_stopping but she 's , she 's L_remarkable !"
kbc-fragment13,6203,She L_really is .
kbc-fragment13,6204,L_Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6205,But they 're few and M_far between are n't they ?
kbc-fragment13,6206,When you 're like that .
kbc-fragment13,6207,Yeah .
kbc-fragment13,6208,L_Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6209,But what I could n't L_understand with this this L_fella that
kbc-fragment13,6210,This L_Sounness ?
kbc-fragment13,6211,L_Aye .
kbc-fragment13,6212,"He , he L_found out L_cos he L_went for , to , for a L_check up and they M_took his L_blood L_pressure ."
kbc-fragment13,6213,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6214,"And L_well M_lots of L_people L_go and have L_blood L_pressure M_taken , they M_find it 's M_high , and they"
kbc-fragment13,6215,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6216,L_give them L_tablets .
kbc-fragment13,6217,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6218,L_Go L_home .
kbc-fragment13,6219,Why did they M_take it a M_stage further with him ?
kbc-fragment13,6220,"He 'd M_got M_high L_blood L_pressure , he was n't in any L_pain he 's L_living a L_normal L_life ."
kbc-fragment13,6221,L_Similar to what I was when I L_went .
kbc-fragment13,6222,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6223,And they just L_give me L_tablets .
kbc-fragment13,6224,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6225,"Now why , what M_made them M_take it to the M_stage"
kbc-fragment13,6226,"L_Well er L_well , L_first"
kbc-fragment13,6227,"where , he L_wanted a L_heart L_bypass ?"
kbc-fragment13,6228,L_first and L_foremost he was in a L_private L_scheme .
kbc-fragment13,6229,"L_Well , L_probably that 's it then ."
kbc-fragment13,6230,Yeah .
kbc-fragment13,6231,and L_probably because because of his L_father and er the the other L_relative having the L_bypasses done .
kbc-fragment13,6232,So they M_took it
kbc-fragment13,6233,L_Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6234,"a M_step further , but I L_think L_probably , it 's because he was in er er a L_private L_scheme ."
kbc-fragment13,6235,Very L_likely in n it ?
kbc-fragment13,6236,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6237,So there 's a M_lot of L_people L_walking about with just L_taking M_bloody L_tablets who L_probably L_really should have a L_bypass .
kbc-fragment13,6238,"L_Ah L_well I , L_well , I would n't L_say that L_really L_Gordon ."
kbc-fragment13,6239,"I L_mean I L_think L_er , when your L_blood L_pressure was L_found out and you 'd been L_taking L_tablets L_ever , so , I L_think it 's M_kept it all under L_control and you 've , you , we L_eat a L_sensible L_diet ."
kbc-fragment13,6240,"The only , the only L_er M_thing I L_complained about with you is , is the L_butter ."
kbc-fragment13,6241,L_Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6242,I do n't have that L_much now .
kbc-fragment13,6243,"But I L_think L_everything in L_moderation , but you do n't L_eat as L_much L_butter now as what you L_used to ."
kbc-fragment13,6244,I do n't L_eat that L_much L_bread you M_see .
kbc-fragment13,6245,No .
kbc-fragment13,6246,"So I , I L_think L_really , and I L_think what I L_think with him , I L_think L_definitely I L_think it must be the L_private L_scheme and L_plus that his own L_family , it M_runs in the L_family ."
kbc-fragment13,6247,L_Mm L_mm .
kbc-fragment13,6248,Must be M_hell of a M_shock being L_told
kbc-fragment13,6249,Oh L_God !
kbc-fragment13,6250,It must have been .
kbc-fragment13,6251,M_See how L_much it 's L_costing ?
kbc-fragment13,6252,Two hundred and fifty L_pounds a L_night !
kbc-fragment13,6253,Yeah .
kbc-fragment13,6254,L_Phworgh !
kbc-fragment13,6255,That 's without the L_operation .
kbc-fragment13,6256,Yeah .
kbc-fragment13,6257,L_Well he L_earned three hundred and fifty thousand a L_year then .
kbc-fragment13,6258,Oh I L_know .
kbc-fragment13,6259,"And plus he 's , he , he , he , he L_married an L_heiress you L_know ."
kbc-fragment13,6260,Did he ?
kbc-fragment13,6261,"L_Er him er , they L_live in L_Spain now ."
kbc-fragment13,6262,"Oh er he , he 's L_worth a M_pretty M_penny is L_Sounness ."
kbc-fragment13,6263,"He L_went in L_Carl 's L_shop the other , the other L_week ."
kbc-fragment13,6264,Did he ?
kbc-fragment13,6265,Yes !
kbc-fragment13,6266,L_Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6267,Must have been L_looking for a L_house .
kbc-fragment13,6268,"L_Carl L_said he , he L_looked er L_well L_er , his L_face did , it were very he 's L_got a very L_poxy L_skin ."
kbc-fragment13,6269,Has he ?
kbc-fragment13,6270,You L_mm .
kbc-fragment13,6271,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6272,He was having it done this L_afternoon were n't he ?

kbc-fragment13,6278,L_Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6279,having it done L_today .
kbc-fragment13,6280,It is L_indeed .
kbc-fragment13,6281,I L_wonder how M_quick they would have L_got him in though if he would n't have been in a L_private L_scheme .
kbc-fragment13,6282,He could L_wait six L_months could n't he ?
kbc-fragment13,6283,L_Well he could have been L_dead by then .
kbc-fragment13,6284,"L_Well L_er , L_yeah , L_exactly that 's what they 're L_moaning about L_int it ?"
kbc-fragment13,6285,L_Terrible !
kbc-fragment13,6286,M_Put them on a L_list and L_wait .
kbc-fragment13,6287,I 've L_never L_heard so L_much L_talk about L_health as we do L_nowadays .
kbc-fragment13,6288,Oh I L_know .
kbc-fragment13,6289,When I was L_young I I do n't L_remember L_talking all the L_time about M_bloody L_health and what you should do and what you should n't do .
kbc-fragment13,6290,No I L_know .
kbc-fragment13,6291,Did you ?
kbc-fragment13,6292,No .
kbc-fragment13,6293,"But we were n't L_educated in , in , in L_health though ."
kbc-fragment13,6294,We just we just L_lived and that was the M_end of it .
kbc-fragment13,6295,"L_Yes but then you M_see , in the in the M_old L_days L_Gordon , I L_mean , you you were very L_fortunate if you L_got three L_meals a L_day and and whatever you L_got you were L_glad of and L_used to L_eat it all ."
kbc-fragment13,6296,Now we 're L_much more L_affluent and L_people are L_educated er
kbc-fragment13,6297,L_Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6298,as L_regards their L_health .
kbc-fragment13,6299,L_Mhm .
kbc-fragment13,6300,"L_Well having L_said that L_Gordon , your L_mother L_lived to a L_good M_old L_age , and my L_mum , and my L_father did ."

kbc-fragment13,6321,"how L_much , how L_much , I do n't L_really L_know ."
kbc-fragment13,6322,L_Cos there 's more L_people now than there was in those L_days .

kbj-fragment17,1482,Two L_yeah but you 've L_got L_right two L_multiple and two M_addition L_equations .
kbj-fragment17,1483,Not L_equations !
kbj-fragment17,1484,You L_told us this !
kbj-fragment17,1485,"But , like these , these are L_equations ."
kbj-fragment17,1486,So two M_addition L_equations er three L_times seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one .
kbj-fragment17,1487,L_Right ?
kbj-fragment17,1488,Oh !
kbj-fragment17,1489,"so , but you can L_also M_go"
kbj-fragment17,1490,Yeah .
kbj-fragment17,1491,Yeah M_add three .
kbj-fragment17,1492,Three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one .
kbj-fragment17,1493,Do it that M_way on .
kbj-fragment17,1494,Do you M_follow
kbj-fragment17,1495,Yeah .
kbj-fragment17,1496,me ?

kbj-fragment17,1513,"And then , this we do like"
kbj-fragment17,1514,"L_Right , she L_wants L_currency in two M_divisions in each , L_right ?"
kbj-fragment17,1515,"So it 's one , two , three , four ,"
kbj-fragment17,1516,That L_multiplication is a
kbj-fragment17,1517,"L_yeah L_well M_divisions , L_okay , so it 's twenty one M_shared by L_say , if that 's one , two , three , four , five , six L_int it ?"
kbj-fragment17,1518,Oh I L_know what I 've M_got !
kbj-fragment17,1519,Six L_times three is eighteen or three L_times six is eighteen .
kbj-fragment17,1520,I L_know what I 've done .
kbj-fragment17,1521,"I 've L_put the , I L_thought it was L_er L_okay ."
kbj-fragment17,1522,Six .
kbj-fragment17,1523,And M_division is M_shared by .
kbj-fragment17,1524,So you L_got to do eighteen M_shared by six is three and eighteen
kbj-fragment17,1525,Have you L_got
kbj-fragment17,1526,M_shared by three is six .
kbj-fragment17,1527,"So like , you M_go one , two , three , four , five , six six L_times you M_swap"
kbj-fragment17,1528,Three .
kbj-fragment17,1529,six L_times three
kbj-fragment17,1530,L_times three is eighteen
kbj-fragment17,1531,is three L_times six .
kbj-fragment17,1532,Six .
kbj-fragment17,1533,"Yeah , and and you L_got"
kbj-fragment17,1534,Six L_times three and three L_times six .
kbj-fragment17,1535,"and M_division is eighteen M_shared by three is six , and eighteen M_shared by six is three !"
kbj-fragment17,1536,Yeah ?
kbj-fragment17,1537,M_Got it ?
kbj-fragment17,1538,I can not L_read .
kbj-fragment17,1539,Three L_sixes are eighteen !
kbj-fragment17,1540,You M_got it ?

kbj-fragment17,1545,That 's what I do n't M_get .
kbj-fragment17,1546,Why do L_multiplication L_equation for this L_similar M_line I do n't M_get how you do that ?
kbj-fragment17,1547,"Is it , would you L_like us to L_put"
kbj-fragment17,1548,It 's L_fours L_int it ?

kbj-fragment17,1566,"And on that one is L_er , L_sixty three M_shared by nine six L_time sixty three M_divided by nine"
kbj-fragment17,1567,four .
kbj-fragment17,1568,No !
kbj-fragment17,1569,Sixty three M_divided by nine is six !
kbj-fragment17,1570,L_Write six through it .

kbw-fragment11,4154,M_Bit of a M_body !

kbw-fragment11,4157,L_Right .
kbw-fragment11,4158,And L_even L_people who L_write about
kbw-fragment11,4159,"If it was not , it ca n't be again , they 're L_always L_going in there !"
kbw-fragment11,4160,L_Well that 's M_fine .
kbw-fragment11,4161,It was some L_country L_mansion in L_Oxfordshire you L_know ?
kbw-fragment11,4162,L_Mm .
kbw-fragment11,4163,It 's as you L_come off the
kbw-fragment11,4164,And how did
kbw-fragment11,4165,and
kbw-fragment11,4166,they M_get L_permission then ?
kbw-fragment11,4167,"They L_somehow M_managed to L_persuade the L_owners , L_apparently it was and it was and L_nobody L_else had L_ever been L_allowed in this L_place not L_even L_erm L_historians who L_write about L_famous L_buildings , L_even they had been L_refused L_access !"
kbw-fragment11,4168,Where is it ?
kbw-fragment11,4169,L_Somewhere in L_Oxfordshire .
kbw-fragment11,4170,Oh !
kbw-fragment11,4171,They do n't L_know where ?
kbw-fragment11,4172,Oh .
kbw-fragment11,4173,So
kbw-fragment11,4174,this was about L_last L_week 's L_episode ?
kbw-fragment11,4175,"I L_think it was about L_last L_week 's , but they L_seem to L_imply that it was L_last L_week 's L_episode that would"
kbw-fragment11,4176,Oh .
kbw-fragment11,4177,do it .
kbw-fragment11,4178,We L_seem to have L_got one L_spare L_video if we do n't L_get it L_watched before L_Wednesday .
kbw-fragment11,4179,L_Alright .
kbw-fragment11,4180,L_Well that 's the only L_chance .
kbw-fragment11,4181,Oh yeah cos we 're L_going to L_Maryland L_tomorrow .
kbw-fragment11,4182,your L_dad .
kbw-fragment11,4183,L_Mm .
kbw-fragment11,4184,"L_Erm not it was n't about your L_dad , it was about my L_birthday L_cos"
kbw-fragment11,4185,L_Cos
kbw-fragment11,4186,"he 'd L_realized that it was my L_birthday , and , what did I L_want ?"
kbw-fragment11,4187,So I L_said L_send me a L_cheque and I 'll L_go and L_shop .
kbw-fragment11,4188,And ?
kbw-fragment11,4189,And L_last L_week L_cos she 's L_quite L_generous is n't she ?
kbw-fragment11,4190,She is a L_bit but it 's .
kbw-fragment11,4191,"No , I did n't L_say L_anything ."
kbw-fragment11,4192,I L_think that 's the M_thing .
kbw-fragment11,4193,So your L_dad L_sent a L_cheque .
kbw-fragment11,4194,"L_Anyway I L_asked her if she 'd L_heard from your L_dad , and she has L_heard from your L_dad L_apparently on L_Friday he L_went to the L_consultant"
kbw-fragment11,4195,L_Mm .
kbw-fragment11,4196,and M_next L_week he 's M_got his L_first L_well she did n't L_know whether it was L_radiotherapy or L_chemotherapy .
kbw-fragment11,4197,And she L_said he has to L_go M_trotting to L_Exeter two or three L_times a L_week now .
kbw-fragment11,4198,L_Mm .
kbw-fragment11,4199,"I do n't L_know how L_long it 's L_going to M_go on for , or what it is L_exactly but I L_thought it would be a L_good L_idea to L_ring your L_dad up and M_see ."
kbw-fragment11,4200,L_Mm .
kbw-fragment11,4201,"But at L_least M_things have M_moved , and at L_least they 've L_gone L_round ."
kbw-fragment11,4202,"So I 'm L_pleased L_really , are you ?"
kbw-fragment11,4203,L_Interesting that they 've done it so M_quickly is n't it ?
kbw-fragment11,4204,"After L_seeing him , because he L_thought that once he 'd L_seen the L_consultant it would then M_take some L_time to L_get the L_treatment L_started , but they must have M_got themselves over that ."
kbw-fragment11,4205,Yeah .
kbw-fragment11,4206,L_Well I L_mean L_everyone .
kbw-fragment11,4207,Yeah .
kbw-fragment11,4208,I L_think .
kbw-fragment11,4209,L_Got L_ta M_get M_moving .
kbw-fragment11,4210,"And L_presumably whatever it was the L_GP had L_give him has had , M_upset that L_thrombosis again ."
kbw-fragment11,4211,"I do n't L_know whether to L_ring him L_tonight , oh it 's too L_late L_tonight now ."
kbw-fragment11,4212,It 's L_much too L_late .
kbw-fragment11,4213,L_Perhaps we could L_ring L_tomorrow L_afternoon when the L_children are up ?
kbw-fragment11,4214,L_Well they L_love L_talking to them on the L_phone do n't they ?
kbw-fragment11,4215,I L_know they do .
kbw-fragment11,4216,We could can M_prime them up on what to L_say and L_types of M_things to L_talk about so they do n't L_get L_moaned down or L_something !
kbw-fragment11,4217,M_Bogged down !
kbw-fragment11,4218,"So he 's had to L_go in , what did you L_say ?"
kbw-fragment11,4219,Three L_times a L_week ?
kbw-fragment11,4220,I do n't L_know she just L_said
kbw-fragment11,4221,L_Something like that
kbw-fragment11,4222,a few L_times a L_week and I L_think it L_sounded like three L_cos she was L_wondering how he would L_cope with L_driving and L_everything .
kbw-fragment11,4223,L_Mm a L_trial !
kbw-fragment11,4224,L_Well I L_hope not I L_mean no he wo n't be L_able to L_drive
kbw-fragment11,4225,"but L_presumably your L_mum can do that for , they 've M_got L_hundreds of L_people there , he 's L_always L_driving L_people L_everywhere"
kbw-fragment11,4226,That 's L_right .
kbw-fragment11,4227,so I do n't M_see why they ca n't L_drive him !
kbw-fragment11,4228,I 'm L_sure they will
kbw-fragment11,4229,Yes .
kbw-fragment11,4230,cos they 're very L_good are n't they ?
kbw-fragment11,4231,I L_mean M_look at that L_woman doing her L_er from the from the L_church .
kbw-fragment11,4232,At L_times like this it would be L_nice if we L_lived nearer could L_help out .
kbw-fragment11,4233,It would L_nice if we L_lived there but we ca n't so
kbw-fragment11,4234,It 's about .
kbw-fragment11,4235,And L_write as L_well .
kbw-fragment11,4236,Yes .
kbw-fragment11,4237,L_Double L_dose .
kbw-fragment11,4238,Yes .
kbw-fragment11,4239,And L_pulled out .
kbw-fragment11,4240,"L_Well it 's L_sort of L_pulled out , but at L_least it 's ."
kbw-fragment11,4241,We 'll be L_paying for it as L_well .
kbw-fragment11,4242,And it 's M_hard as L_well .
kbw-fragment11,4243,"We 've been L_paying L_anyway , so it must of you L_know ."
kbw-fragment11,4244,What does L_erm you M_see er L_Eileen 's and she 's having L_chemotherapy is n't she ?
kbw-fragment11,4245,"By , by L_medication , is"
kbw-fragment11,4246,that L_right ?
kbw-fragment11,4247,L_Well she L_takes all these L_tablet L_things .
kbw-fragment11,4248,That 's L_right she has a L_sort of M_massive L_dose every now and then .
kbw-fragment11,4249,And that M_makes her M_feel what ?
kbw-fragment11,4250,She 's not in L_pain is she ?
kbw-fragment11,4251,More L_sort of L_dopey .
kbw-fragment11,4252,I would n't L_care if they M_made me L_dazed
kbw-fragment11,4253,Yeah .
kbw-fragment11,4254,!
kbw-fragment11,4255,Yeah .
kbw-fragment11,4256,I L_du n no .
kbw-fragment11,4257,Not L_gon na
kbw-fragment11,4258,L_Difficult to L_know .
kbw-fragment11,4259,"Oh yes , that was it !"
kbw-fragment11,4260,"I L_wonder how L_bad it is , that L_feeling 's L_like , we do n't L_really L_know how L_bad it is do we ?"
kbw-fragment11,4261,No .
kbw-fragment11,4262,"L_Perhaps he will be L_able to L_say , you L_know ?"
kbw-fragment11,4263,"But whether he 'd L_tell us over the L_telephone , you L_think L_ask ."
kbw-fragment11,4264,I L_think he would would n't he ?
kbw-fragment11,4265,I L_think so .
kbw-fragment17,5989,L_Cos we 've M_got the L_AGM in two L_weeks L_time
kbw-fragment17,5990,L_Mm .
kbw-fragment17,5991,and we L_voted all these L_people that are here

a1e-fragment01,2,By L_FRANK L_KANE
a1e-fragment01,3,"IT L_SEEMS that L_Roland L_Franklin , the L_latest L_unbundler to L_appear in the L_UK , has M_made a M_fatal L_error in the L_preparation of his £697m L_break-up L_bid for L_stationery and L_packaging L_group L_DRG ."
a1e-fragment01,4,He has not L_properly L_investigated the M_target 's L_dining L_facilities .
a1e-fragment01,5,"The 63-year-old M_head of L_Pembridge L_Investments , through which the L_bid is being M_mounted L_says , ‘ M_rule L_number one in this L_business is : the more L_luxurious the L_luncheon L_rooms at M_headquarters , the more L_inefficient the L_business ’ ."
a1e-fragment01,6,"If he had M_taken his own L_rule L_seriously , he would have L_found out that L_DRG has a very M_modest L_self-service L_canteen at its L_Bristol M_head L_office ."
a1e-fragment01,7,"There are other M_things he has , on his own M_admission , not L_fully L_investigated , like the L_value of the L_DRG L_properties , or which M_part of the L_DRG L_business he would M_keep after the L_break up ."
a1e-fragment01,8,"When the L_bid was M_launched L_last L_week , L_Mr L_Franklin M_faced some L_criticism from L_City L_commentators on both those M_counts ."
a1e-fragment01,9,He M_regards the M_charges as L_unfounded .
a1e-fragment01,10,"On L_property , he is M_blunt ."
a1e-fragment01,11,‘ I do not M_regard L_property L_profits as L_earnings .
a1e-fragment01,12,"We have M_made a L_bid of L_nearly £700m for a L_company with a L_book L_value of £200m — we 've L_acknowledged there is some L_extra L_worth there , but I can not M_see the L_sort of L_value they are L_talking about in L_property ."
a1e-fragment01,13,"If they can L_prove it is there , we might L_pay for it , ’"
a1e-fragment01,14,On the other L_criticism he is L_equally L_dismissive .
a1e-fragment01,15,"‘ That M_point about the L_core L_business is very L_unfair , ’ he L_says ."
a1e-fragment01,16,It is L_difficult to L_decide when you are an L_outsider what the L_business is L_like .
a1e-fragment01,17,"We would L_eventually L_like to do it along with the L_management , within the L_philosophy we will L_impose . ’"
a1e-fragment01,18,The L_Franklin L_philosophy was L_learnt in the L_US L_leveraged L_buyout L_business at the M_side of L_Sir L_James L_Goldsmith .
a1e-fragment01,19,"L_Mr L_Franklin L_went there at the M_end of the 1970s , after the M_collapse of L_Keyser L_Ullman , the L_merchant L_bank where he was a L_director that was L_rescued by the L_Bank of L_England ."
a1e-fragment01,20,He M_feels that L_Keyser 's L_problems were L_hastened by an L_unwise L_acquisition .
a1e-fragment01,21,He L_went to the L_US because ‘ L_Goldsmith L_decided that if you L_wanted to be a L_capitalist the L_UK and L_France were not the L_places to be ’ .
a1e-fragment01,22,"Along with L_Sir L_James he M_found the L_US L_much more M_attractive , L_taking over and M_breaking up some L_fairly M_hefty L_US L_corporations ."
a1e-fragment01,23,He L_rejects M_charges that he was L_partly L_responsible for the ‘ M_casino M_atmosphere ’ that M_gripped L_US L_corporate M_life in the L_early 1980s .
a1e-fragment01,24,"‘ We M_stirred it up , yes , but we L_never M_lost any L_money for L_anybody and we L_never M_added to the L_unemployment L_figures . ’"
a1e-fragment01,25,What he has L_learned from L_Goldsmith ( ‘ the only L_genius I have L_ever M_come across ’ ) is that the L_holding L_company is not the most L_important L_unit of L_corporate L_organisation .
a1e-fragment01,26,‘ The L_concept of the L_company does not L_interest me - it 's the L_businesses that are L_important .
a1e-fragment01,27,It does not L_matter whether or not L_DRG M_makes L_sellotape or L_Basildon L_Bond — it 's of no L_consequence to L_anybody if L_somebody L_else L_makes them . ’
a1e-fragment01,28,And there is L_always the L_ultimate L_unbundler 's M_defence — that he will M_make L_money for his L_backers .
a1e-fragment01,29,"In a L_takeover L_campaign that has L_already M_seen L_vitriolic L_language , he L_responds to the M_charge that he is M_mounting the L_bid to L_enrich himself and his L_friends by L_saying : ‘ L_Nobody could M_take that as a L_criticism — this is an L_investor L_group ."
a1e-fragment01,30,It would be a L_criticism if I was doing it to L_impoverish myself ’ .

a1f-fragment07,148,"L_Sir : Despite a L_significant M_gap in the L_Labour L_Party 's L_education and L_training L_proposals , their L_objective to L_double the L_number of 16-18year-olds in L_full-time L_education must be M_welcomed ( 28 L_September ) ."
a1f-fragment07,149,L_England 's L_full-time staying-on L_rate M_stands at 28 per L_cent L_according to the L_latest L_statistics L_available .
a1f-fragment07,150,"This L_compares with 79 per L_cent in the L_US , 86 per L_cent in L_Sweden , 45 per L_cent in L_West L_Germany and 69 per L_cent in L_Japan ."
a1f-fragment07,151,To M_add the L_part-time L_education and L_training L_statistics to those L_figures does not L_improve our L_relative M_position .
a1f-fragment07,152,L_Labour M_hopes to L_transform the M_situation by L_increasing the L_number of M_A-levels to five for the M_brighter L_youngsters and L_providing L_grants for L_four-year L_training M_courses ( two L_years in a Further L_Education L_college M_followed by two with an L_employer ) for the L_rest .
a1f-fragment07,153,These L_reforms will only M_achieve their L_objective if M_accompanied by the L_implementation of the 1944 L_Education L_Act L_provision for L_compulsory L_part- or L_full-time L_education or L_training up to the L_age of 18 .
a1f-fragment07,154,This L_clause has L_never L_yet been M_activated .
a1f-fragment07,155,The L_sharply L_reduced L_number of 16-18-year-olds will L_inevitably M_lead L_employers to L_bid up the L_wages of that L_age M_group to L_entice L_young L_people M_away from L_education and into M_unskilled or M_semi-skilled L_jobs .
a1f-fragment07,156,L_Employers must be L_required to M_release 16-18-year-olds for L_education and L_training for at L_least two L_days per L_week .
a1f-fragment07,157,"Only then will two L_vitally L_important and L_complementary M_goals be L_achieved : to L_improve L_Britain 's L_general L_educational and M_vocational L_competence , and L_hence our M_productive L_capacity ; and to M_reduce our L_gross L_educational L_inequalities between the L_elite who L_receive a M_narrow L_education to a very M_high M_standard , and the L_rest ."
a1f-fragment08,158,L_Letter : L_Policy and L_politics at the L_Labour L_Party L_Conference
a1f-fragment08,159,From L_MR L_JOHN L_PERTWEE
a1f-fragment08,160,L_Sir : L_Labour does not M_need a L_commitment to L_proportional L_representation in L_order to M_scoop most of the M_centre M_ground at the M_next L_general L_election .
a1f-fragment08,161,"All it M_needs is to L_promise a L_high-powered L_investigation , such as a L_Royal L_Commission , into the L_practicalities of an L_alternative L_voting M_system ( L_surely L_justified by the L_intense L_public L_interest now L_abounding ) ."
a1f-fragment08,162,Such a L_promise would be the only L_hope of a L_breakthrough for the L_disenfranchised L_voters and would have them L_flocking to the L_polls for L_Mr L_Kinnock .

a1f-fragment09,164,L_Letter : L_Policy and L_politics at the L_Labour L_Party L_Conference
a1f-fragment09,165,From L_MR L_DENIS L_MacSHANE
a1f-fragment09,166,"L_Sir : If L_Labour is to L_suggest the M_setting up of a L_specialist L_labour L_court ( 30 L_September ) , then such a L_momentous L_change in the L_industrial L_relations M_system M_deserves more L_discussion , and M_needs to be M_taken out of the M_hot-house of L_Labour L_Party L_conference L_politics ."
a1f-fragment09,167,For three L_reasons such a M_move should be M_welcomed .
a1f-fragment09,168,"L_First , it would M_bring L_Britain into L_line with the L_best L_European L_practice , L_notably in L_Germany where L_local , L_regional and L_federal L_labour L_courts M_handle L_problems in a M_fair , L_dispassionate M_way M_based on L_law , L_precedent and L_judicial L_expertise in the L_labour M_field ."
a1f-fragment09,169,"L_Second , it would L_ensure that L_workers M_enjoyed L_positive M_rights under L_law and M_reduce the M_emphasis of L_union M_immunities ."
a1f-fragment09,170,"L_Labour L_law will L_always M_reflect the M_balance of M_power in L_society , and a M_fully M_fledged L_labour L_court M_system will not M_remove L_class and L_fundamental L_employer-employee L_differences ."
a1f-fragment09,171,But it should be L_possible to L_create and L_enforce L_enough L_common L_rules to L_prevent the L_absurd M_see-sawing of L_industrial L_relations L_legislation we have M_seen since 1969 .
a1f-fragment09,172,"L_Third , a L_labour L_division of the M_High L_Court would L_contribute to the L_process of M_constitutional L_reform in L_Britain which L_surely is to be a L_key L_political L_issue in the 1990s ."
a1f-fragment09,173,The ‘ L_trade L_union L_question ’ would L_cease to M_haunt the L_Labour L_Party and while that might M_upset some L_Conservatives it would be L_good for the L_country .

a1f-fragment10,178,The L_supposedly L_jokey L_answers are M_illustrated by L_photographs of L_people L_sleeping outside L_covered by L_copies of The L_Independent : they L_look like some of the M_hundreds of M_visitors who M_come to M_St M_Botolph 's M_Crypt M_Centre for M_homeless M_people every M_day .

a1f-fragment11,184,L_Sir : The M_contents of L_Sarah L_Helm 's L_article ‘ L_Immigration L_checks to be M_made on L_trains ’ ( 25 L_September ) are L_extremely L_worrying .
a1f-fragment11,185,During the L_recent L_European L_Community L_elections the L_representatives of L_EC L_governments M_promoted the L_ideal of a L_border-free L_Europe by 1992 .
a1f-fragment11,186,"Now , it would M_appear from this L_article , that this L_ideal is M_shattered and a two-tiered L_Europe is on the M_cards ."
a1f-fragment11,187,One for those who L_travel by L_aircraft and one for those who L_travel by L_train between L_London and L_Paris .
a1f-fragment11,188,The L_presence of L_immigration L_officials and L_police on L_board L_trains is L_comparable to the M_scenes of 1930s L_America where L_migrant L_labourers were L_turned L_back at L_state L_boundaries .
a1f-fragment11,189,What L_criteria would L_police and L_immigration L_officials L_use in their L_search for ‘ L_potential L_terrorists ’ on a L_train that they could not L_use at a L_static L_checkpoint or L_airport ?
a1f-fragment11,190,Do L_terrorists or L_illegal L_persons L_travel L_exclusively by L_train ?
a1f-fragment11,191,"This is a M_clear L_example of the M_extension of the L_Prevention of L_Terrorism L_Act where L_criteria for L_stopping , L_questioning and L_searching are L_purely L_subjective to the L_official L_involved ."
a1f-fragment11,192,"Will a L_person 's L_accent , L_dress or L_skin L_colour L_indicate the L_potential L_terrorist or , for that L_matter , L_football L_hooligan or L_drug L_pusher ?"
a1f-fragment11,193,This is a M_recipe for L_fear and L_anxiety .

a1g-fragment27,425,"In his L_minute , L_inaccessible L_capital , which L_today has only 15,000 L_inhabitants , L_Nicholas L_erected a L_miniature L_European L_court and an L_exquisitely L_furnished L_Victorian L_palace ."
a1g-fragment27,426,He L_even L_persuaded 12 L_European M_powers to M_turn L_cottages into L_full L_embassies .
a1g-fragment27,427,It was a M_fair L_achievement in a L_town which an L_earlier L_observer L_described as ‘ 44 L_hovels ’ .

a1h-fragment05,69,L_Obituary : L_Virgil L_Thomson
a1h-fragment05,70,By L_PETER L_DICKINSON
a1h-fragment05,71,"L_VIRGIL L_THOMSON was a L_composer and L_writer of L_originality , L_courage and L_wit M_formed by a L_unique M_mixture of L_American and L_French L_influences ."
a1h-fragment05,72,"L_Thomson was L_born in L_Kansas L_City in 1896 , M_studied at L_Harvard , and then L_mostly L_lived in L_Paris until 1940 ."
a1h-fragment05,73,"His L_Missouri L_childhood M_gave him M_access to L_Baptist L_hymns and L_church L_music , but at L_Harvard he was M_introduced to the L_writings of L_Gertrude L_Stein and the L_music of L_Erik L_Satie ."
a1h-fragment05,74,These L_influences M_laid the M_foundations for the M_blend of the L_naive and the L_sophisticated which is the M_hallmark of L_Thomson 's L_maturity .
a1h-fragment05,75,"Like L_many L_young L_American L_composers he M_studied with L_Nadia L_Boulanger , but after 1925 M_set out to L_achieve the ‘ L_discipline of L_spontaneity ’ which he M_found in L_Stein 's L_writings ."
a1h-fragment05,76,When he L_collaborated M_directly with her in L_opera the L_result was of M_historical L_significance .
a1h-fragment05,77,"L_First M_came L_Four L_Saints in L_Three L_Acts , L_produced in 1934 , and then The L_Mother of L_Us All ( 1947 ) , which M_demonstrated a L_new L_kind of M_plotless L_opera only now M_reaching a M_wider M_currency through the L_stage L_works of L_Philip L_Glass ."
a1h-fragment05,78,"In L_Four L_Saints L_Thomson 's L_informality was M_given M_free M_reign since he L_first of all L_improvised the L_music at the L_piano then , when it M_stuck , L_wrote it down to a M_figured L_bass ."
a1h-fragment05,79,He L_said : ‘ I had L_wondered whether a M_piece so M_drenched in L_Anglican L_chant ( M_running from L_Gilbert and L_Sullivan to L_Morning L_Prayer and M_back ) could M_rise and M_sail . ’
a1h-fragment05,80,"But the L_resulting M_mixture of L_hymns , L_folksy L_tunes and L_recitatives — at L_times of M_intoxicating L_banality — was a M_sensation ."
a1h-fragment05,81,"The L_opera , like L_Gershwin 's L_Porgy and Bess the L_following L_year , M_used an L_all-Black M_cast and the L_staging and L_choreography M_gave it a L_British M_connection since it was by L_Frederick L_Ashton ."
a1h-fragment05,82,"The L_Mother of L_Us All M_shows more L_continuity , but again L_much L_depends upon L_production in what is L_still a L_largely L_non-narrative L_opera ."
a1h-fragment05,83,"In 1936 , three L_years before L_Aaron L_Copland , L_Thomson L_started L_writing L_film M_scores which were a M_model of L_unobtrusive M_clarity and L_pertinence , L_combining L_American M_materials to M_suit L_documentaries such as The L_Plow that M_Broke the L_Plains and The L_River with the musique d'ameublement M_approach of L_Satie ."
a1h-fragment05,84,His M_score for the L_film L_Louisiana L_Story was M_awarded the L_Pulitzer L_Prize in 1948 .
a1h-fragment05,85,Another L_response to a L_visual L_stimulus was L_Thomson 's L_series of L_musical M_portraits of L_people such as L_Picasso and L_Aaron L_Copland .
a1h-fragment05,86,The L_first of these was L_written in 1928 and they L_number about 150 .
a1h-fragment05,87,"Just as L_Thomson M_transferred L_Stein 's L_literary L_abstraction to L_music , so these M_portraits L_unusually M_employ the M_painter 's M_technique of M_drawing the M_sitter from L_life : an L_ideal L_combination of L_Thomson 's M_habit of M_immediate L_response with an L_actual M_subject ."
a1h-fragment05,88,"The L_results are M_terse and L_sharply M_etched , like the L_best M_line M_drawings ."
a1h-fragment05,89,L_Thomson could M_control L_words with the same L_fastidiousness as L_notes .
a1h-fragment05,90,"He L_always M_felt that L_effective L_musical L_criticism M_began by being L_well L_written , and he L_never M_lost his L_liveliness ."
a1h-fragment05,91,One L_never L_quite L_knew what he was L_going to L_say L_next .
a1h-fragment05,92,"He L_started by L_writing L_occasional L_articles but in 1939 he L_wrote The L_State of L_Music , a L_trenchant and L_provocative M_assessment of the M_machinery of the L_musical L_profession at the L_time ."
a1h-fragment05,93,From 1940 to 1954 he L_wrote L_regularly for the L_New L_York L_Herald L_Tribune and four L_volumes of his M_notices have M_appeared in L_book M_form .
a1h-fragment05,94,"He L_wrote a L_fulsome 400-page L_autobiography , L_characteristically L_entitled L_Virgil L_Thomson on L_Virgil L_Thomson , and a L_personal L_survey , L_American L_Music since 1910 , M_appeared in 1972 , M_followed L_recently by a L_selected L_edition of his L_letters ."
a1h-fragment05,95,As both L_composer and L_critic he M_touched both M_sides of the M_coin : A M_climate of L_receptivity is what the L_artist most L_desires .
a1h-fragment05,96,It is L_also a M_thing that L_even the most L_experienced L_reviewer can not L_always L_offer .
a1h-fragment05,97,L_Thomson 's L_judgements about L_music were not L_always as L_accurate as his L_confident L_expression L_implied : he M_invited L_discussion .
a1h-fragment05,98,Above all he M_restored the M_focus of L_music L_criticism onto the L_music itself .
a1h-fragment05,99,"He M_made no L_secret of his L_Francophile L_enthusiasms , in M_reaction to the L_earlier L_domination of L_American L_music by L_Germans , and he was one of the L_first L_writers to M_register the L_importance of L_jazz ."
a1h-fragment05,100,"He L_fearlessly M_attacked L_convention , which L_caused L_problems when he M_pitched into L_established L_reputations ."
a1h-fragment05,101,It has L_become L_increasingly L_apparent that L_Thomson M_belonged to the L_American L_experimental L_tradition .
a1h-fragment05,102,"He L_anticipated some of the L_enthusiasms of L_John L_Cage , whom he L_first L_met in 1941 ."
a1h-fragment05,103,"A few L_years L_later L_Thomson M_recognised L_Cage as ‘ the most L_original L_composer in L_America , if not the L_world … ’ and L_Cage M_repaid the L_compliment by L_writing the L_works M_section of a L_monograph on L_Thomson ."
a1h-fragment05,104,"But L_finally , in L_spite of their L_common M_roots in L_Satie and L_Stein , L_Thomson M_felt that L_Cage 's L_aesthetic was M_destructive ."
a1h-fragment05,105,L_Thomson 's L_songs M_contain some of his M_finest L_work .
a1h-fragment05,106,"There are L_Stein M_settings , such as ‘ M_Portrait of L_FB ’ , but L_also M_cycles such as Five L_Songs from L_William L_Blake , L_Prayers and L_Praises and a L_cantata M_based on L_poems by L_Edward L_Lear ."
a1h-fragment05,107,L_Thomson was L_also M_prolific in L_instrumental L_music on both L_chamber and L_solo M_scale .
a1h-fragment05,108,For L_many L_years L_Thomson L_lived in L_New L_York in his L_apartment at the L_Chelsea L_Hotel .
a1h-fragment05,109,"From there , like a M_buzzard in its M_eyrie , he would M_make M_forays L_round the L_US and L_abroad in L_spite of his M_advanced L_age ."
a1h-fragment05,110,"He L_seemed a L_genial and M_indestructible M_landmark in the L_history of L_American L_music , in L_spite of L_defective L_hearing which had M_bothered him since the L_late L_Seventies ."
a1h-fragment05,111,He had a L_photograph of himself on his L_postcards and he L_signed his L_letters M_following the L_original L_tailpiece ‘ L_everbest ’ .
a1h-fragment05,112,L_Thomson M_came from a L_generation of L_American L_composers which had to M_find its own M_way without L_benefit of L_university L_patronage .
a1h-fragment05,113,In that L_kind of M_free M_market he L_thrived and L_survived — and so will the L_best of his L_work .
a1h-fragment06,114,L_Obituary : L_Thomas L_Keller
a1h-fragment06,115,By L_HUGH L_MATHESON
a1h-fragment06,116,L_THOMI L_KELLER is the M_outstanding L_figure in the L_history of L_international L_rowing .
a1h-fragment06,117,"He was L_President of L_FISA ( L_Federation L_Internationale des Societes d'Aviron ) , the L_world L_governing M_body , for 30 L_years ; and most of this M_body 's M_attitudes and M_practices M_reflect the M_force of his L_strict , but L_genial L_personality ."
a1h-fragment06,118,"Most L_athletes L_first L_encountered him as a L_voice , M_bellowing in L_multi-lingual L_fury at L_officials who had M_broken L_rules or M_arrangements M_designed to M_make L_racing L_safer or more M_fair ."
a1h-fragment06,119,He was L_elected to L_succeed L_Gaston L_Mullegg as L_President of L_FISA when he was 33 and L_still L_competing in the L_Swiss L_rowing L_team .
a1h-fragment06,120,He did not M_loosen his M_links with the L_athletes when M_projected M_upwards into the L_Presidency .
a1h-fragment06,121,"L_Provided their L_behaviour was L_sportsmanlike and L_safe , L_oarsmen M_found only L_encouragement and L_humour from a L_President who was L_always among them ."
a1h-fragment06,122,"L_Keller 's L_Zurich L_upbringing M_made him into a L_skiier and L_sculler , and he L_raced for the L_Grasshopper L_club ."
a1h-fragment06,123,He L_competed for the L_Swiss L_cross-country and L_ski-jumping L_team at the L_Student L_Winter L_Games and L_later L_concentrated on L_single L_sculls .
a1h-fragment06,124,"In 1950 , he was L_Swiss L_sculls L_champion and L_finished L_third in the L_European L_championships before L_moving to L_Manila to L_work for his L_family 's L_private L_multinational L_company , L_Eduard L_Keller L_Ltd , for four L_years ."
a1h-fragment06,125,"On his L_return , L_Keller was L_Swiss L_champion again in 1955 and was L_bitterly L_disappointed when the L_Swiss L_chose to L_boycott the 1956 L_Olympics after the L_Russian L_intervention in L_Hungary ."
a1h-fragment06,126,L_FISA was then a L_relatively L_unimportant M_body which M_organised L_European and other L_championships and M_participated in the M_running of L_Olympic L_regattas .
a1h-fragment06,127,"As a L_rich , L_forceful L_young L_man , L_Keller had been M_earmarked as a L_likely L_future L_president , L_even before L_Mullegg was L_killed in an L_aircrash in 1958 ."
a1h-fragment06,128,L_Rowing was L_transformed in the M_breadth and M_depth of L_participation over the 30 L_years of his L_term .
a1h-fragment06,129,He M_sat on the L_appropriate M_boards of the L_International L_Olympic L_Committee and was L_President of the L_General L_Assembly of L_International L_Sports L_Federations for 17 L_years .
a1h-fragment06,130,These M_positions were not M_held for his own M_status but to L_promote the M_cause of L_rowing where it M_needed L_clout .
a1h-fragment06,131,"He L_successfully M_defended L_rowing as an L_Olympic L_sport and in 1976 M_introduced L_women 's L_events , which have now M_expanded to six L_classes ."
a1h-fragment06,132,His L_personal L_preference for L_sculling over L_rowing M_assisted the L_introduction of L_quadruple L_sculls to L_world L_championship and L_Olympic L_competition .
a1h-fragment06,133,"L_Keller was M_made a L_Steward of L_Henley L_Royal L_Regatta in 1976 , a L_time when the L_proliferation of L_new six-lane , L_still-water M_courses around the L_world , which had M_emerged under his M_guidance , L_seemed a M_threat to the L_regatta L_founded in 1829 ."
a1h-fragment06,134,"But it was the M_spirit of L_Henley , with L_huge L_crowds L_enjoying L_amateur L_sport , M_presented with L_administrative L_finesse , which L_Keller M_took as the M_yardstick for the L_international M_circuit ."
a1h-fragment06,135,He L_loved the L_place and he L_returned every L_year to M_play an L_often L_small M_part as M_umpire of L_races between L_undistinguished L_clubs M_far below the L_Olympic M_standard he was L_obliged to L_administer .
a1h-fragment06,136,"He L_said this L_summer that as he L_gradually L_wound down his L_involvement in L_sport , L_Henley would be the L_last M_thing he would L_give up ."
a1h-fragment06,137,During his L_term as L_President of L_FISA he L_gradually M_reduced his M_role in L_Eduard L_Keller L_Ltd and L_used the L_company L_offices to L_provide a L_world M_headquarters for L_rowing .
a1h-fragment06,138,"The L_sport is now M_obliged to M_find L_income from the more L_normal M_sources of L_television and L_sponsorship , to M_replace his L_largely L_unacknowledged L_private L_patronage ."
a1h-fragment06,139,"In L_spite of his L_gift to the L_sport , L_Keller was L_anxious not to M_abuse his L_status as L_President and L_never L_went to a L_rowing L_event unless L_invited ."
a1h-fragment06,140,"Because of this , he had L_never L_seen the L_Oxford and L_Cambridge L_boat L_race until this L_year ."
a1h-fragment06,141,He was L_enthralled by the L_entire L_proceeding and L_remarked that only the L_English could M_make a L_contest between two L_crews which would not M_rank in the L_World 's M_top 10 into a M_bigger L_spectacle than the L_Olympic L_final .
a1h-fragment06,142,"The L_final L_task he M_set himself for his L_Presidency , which was L_due to L_end L_next L_year , was to M_weed out of the L_Regatta L_calendar all the L_rowing M_courses which could be M_made M_unfair by the L_wind ."
a1h-fragment06,143,"He had L_recently L_travelled from L_Tasmania to L_Norway in L_search of the L_perfect 2,000 L_metres of L_flat L_water ."
a1h-fragment06,144,"It was a L_blessing that , in L_response to L_congratulations on the L_superb L_World L_Championship L_Regatta at L_Bled in L_Yugoslavia three L_weeks L_ago , he was L_able to L_reply , ‘ L_Yes … and L_best of all , the L_conditions were M_fair throughout ’ ."
a1j-fragment34,533,The L_Labour L_Party L_Conference : L_Cook L_appeals for L_Labour to M_accept L_electoral L_reform
a1j-fragment34,534,By L_COLIN L_HUGHES and L_COLIN L_BROWN
a1j-fragment34,535,AN L_IMPASSIONED L_appeal for L_Labour to M_back L_electoral L_reform was M_made by a M_leading M_Shadow L_Cabinet M_member L_yesterday after the L_national L_executive M_decided L_overwhelmingly to M_oppose a L_proportional L_representation L_motion .
a1j-fragment34,536,"L_Robin L_Cook , a M_member of the L_national L_executive and the L_health L_spokesman , L_said that a L_Labour L_government which M_sought to M_force its L_programme on an L_unwilling L_nation would be L_unsocialist ."
a1j-fragment34,537,He L_told a L_Labour M_Co-ordinating L_Committee L_rally that it was not L_enough for L_Labour to L_win the L_next L_election .
a1j-fragment34,538,"It would L_also be L_necessary ‘ to M_smash the M_decrepit , M_effete M_constitution that M_allows a L_minority to M_capture M_power , and then M_use it L_ruthlessly in the M_interests of the L_privileged few ’ ."
a1j-fragment34,539,"L_Mr L_Cook L_argued that 10 L_years of L_Thatcherism had been M_forced on most L_people , who had L_never L_voted L_Conservative , and that L_many of those who L_opposed L_PR in the L_Labour L_Party L_wanted to L_use the same L_undemocratic M_power ‘ to M_ram L_socialism down the M_throats of a L_majority who did n't L_vote for it ’ ."
a1j-fragment34,540,"L_Advocates of the L_first-past-the-post M_system L_argued that it was the only M_way of M_delivering M_strong L_government , L_Mr L_Cook L_said ."
a1j-fragment34,541,"But after 10 L_years of L_Tory L_rule , he had had M_enough of that M_approach to L_politics ."
a1j-fragment34,542,"L_Labour would be M_acquiescing in a ‘ L_democratic L_outrage ’ if it L_continued M_arguing that , because the L_Conservatives had M_got L_away with being L_undemocratic for so M_long , it was now L_Labour 's M_turn ."
a1j-fragment34,543,"L_Mr L_Cook L_also L_countered the L_argument that L_PR would M_build in a M_pull towards the M_centre M_ground , L_preventing L_Labour from L_implementing a M_radical L_programme ."
a1j-fragment34,544,"It L_seemed L_strange to M_make that L_argument , L_Mr L_Cook L_said , when it was M_clear the M_whole L_policy L_review L_process was M_designed to L_placate the M_centre M_ground ."
a1j-fragment34,545,‘ I can not L_honestly M_see that a M_system which would L_require us to L_compromise the L_morning after the L_election is L_really so L_morally M_inferior to a M_system which has L_already M_obliged us to L_compromise our L_policies two L_years before L_polling L_day . ’
a1j-fragment34,546,"His L_speech , L_however , M_came L_aftera 24-4 L_vote in the L_national L_executive to L_oppose a L_proportional L_representation L_motion which will be L_debated on L_Thursday ."
a1j-fragment34,547,"The four were L_Mr L_Cook , L_Ken L_Livingstone , L_John L_Evans and L_Clare L_Short ."
a1j-fragment34,548,"L_Mr L_Livingstone L_said he was against L_pacts , but 10 L_years of L_Thatcherism had M_demonstrated the L_dangers of M_giving M_power to L_elites ."
a1j-fragment34,549,"L_However , L_Neil L_Kinnock , the L_Labour L_leader , and L_Roy L_Hattersley , his L_deputy , both L_opposed the L_motion ."
a1j-fragment34,550,"L_Mr L_Hattersley L_said M_giving L_disproportionate M_power to L_small , L_minority M_centre L_parties would not L_improve L_democracy ."
a1j-fragment34,551,L_Mr L_Kinnock L_said it was L_wrong to L_propose a L_fundamental L_change in the L_voting M_system for a L_short-term M_tactical L_vote to M_get M_rid of the L_Thatcher L_Government .
a1j-fragment34,552,The only M_way to M_remove the L_Government was for L_Labour to L_win the L_next L_general L_election .
a1j-fragment34,553,L_Mr L_Kinnock L_intends to M_reinforce his M_conviction that L_Labour is in a M_position to L_win in his L_keynote L_speech L_tomorrow .
a1j-fragment34,554,"L_Party L_organisers L_want the L_conference to M_show that the L_party is L_united as L_never before , M_leaving L_Mr L_Kinnock M_free for the L_first L_time to M_sell the L_policy M_package to L_voters without L_worrying about M_splits ."
a1j-fragment34,555,"There is L_expected to be a M_close L_vote on L_defence , but L_Mr L_Kinnock is L_confident the L_new L_policy will be L_affirmed L_today ."
a1j-fragment34,556,The L_executive is M_recommending L_rejection of a L_motion M_calling for L_unilateral L_disarmament .
a1j-fragment34,557,"It is L_also M_urging the L_conference to M_oppose a L_motion , M_supported by the L_National L_Union of L_Mineworkers , to M_commit a L_Labour L_government to L_abolishing all L_nuclear M_power within 15 L_years ."
a1j-fragment34,558,There could L_also be L_controversy over the L_executive 's M_rejection of L_demands for the L_age of L_consent for L_homosexuals to be M_reduced to 16 L_years .

a1k-fragment02,29,By L_JIM L_WHITE
a1k-fragment02,30,L_GENERAL L_TIPS A L_general M_rule for L_pub L_rock L_patrons is that the L_quality of L_music will be in L_inverse L_proportion to the L_quality of the L_beer ( except at L_Finsbury L_Park 's L_Sir L_George L_Robey where an L_excellent L_music L_policy M_comes M_complete with a M_decent L_pint of L_Guinness ) .
a1k-fragment02,31,"Another M_rule of M_thumb is that if the L_act is M_obliged to M_rest their L_microphone L_stand and L_amplifiers on L_beer L_crates L_instead of the L_stage , it will be a L_good L_evening ."
a1k-fragment02,32,"There are two L_types of L_pub L_rock L_occasions : those , like the one L_described above , where the L_band is L_likely to L_suffer from L_agrophobia ; and those where the L_pub is so L_crowded , L_death through L_asphixiation L_seems to be the only M_way to L_get out ."

a1k-fragment02,36,"WHO TO L_WATCH While the L_best that L_chart L_music can M_manage in the M_way of L_band L_names is L_Black L_Box , the L_pub M_circuit has L_always been M_ripe with L_imaginative M_handles ."

a1l-fragment01,9,They L_win their L_parents over with a M_rose-tinted L_vision of the L_world which is L_decidedly M_reassuring .
a1l-fragment01,10,Their L_books are L_usually M_set L_nostalgically in the L_past — the L_Thirties and L_Forties are L_favourite L_periods — and L_often L_feature the M_perennial M_characters of L_fairy L_tales and L_nursery L_rhymes .

a1m-fragment01,4,The only L_computers in L_many L_villages are those owned by the L_teenage L_boys of the L_affluent to L_play their L_wham-bam L_games .
a1m-fragment01,5,"L_Ashley L_Dobbs , an L_engaging L_young L_entrepreneur , is M_setting out to M_change that by L_creating a L_nationwide L_network of ‘ L_telecottages ’ ."
a1m-fragment01,6,"This M_clever L_name , with its M_neat L_evocation of L_new and L_old , M_describes a L_concept which was L_developed in L_Sweden and is M_spreading to L_rural L_areas across the L_world ."
a1m-fragment01,7,"In L_Mr L_Dobbs 's L_words , a L_telecottage is ‘ a L_room in a L_village L_filled with L_computer L_communications that can be L_used by L_local L_people to L_learn and L_work ’ ."
a1m-fragment01,8,"The L_equipment L_consists of , L_perhaps , four L_word L_processors , a L_modem , a L_laser L_printer L_able to L_produce L_artwork-quality L_output , a L_fax and a L_photocopier ."
a1m-fragment01,9,"L_Software L_programmes for L_desk-top L_publishing , L_word L_processing , L_accounting and L_business L_planning are L_also L_essential ."
a1m-fragment01,10,"L_Mr L_Dobbs , who is L_chairman of L_Telecottages L_UK , L_warns L_possible L_users not to L_get M_bogged down with the L_technology : ‘ The L_equipment is a L_tool to M_overcome what L_needs to be done ."
a1m-fragment01,11,"L_People must n't L_think that because there 's a L_computer , they 've L_got to L_think of a L_use for it . ’"
a1m-fragment01,12,"He M_reckons there are no L_shortages of L_possible L_uses — L_farmers can L_use it to do their L_accounts , L_women with L_child-care L_responsibilities can L_work in their own L_time on the L_word L_processors , L_publicity M_material for L_local L_craftsmen can be M_produced and so on ."
a1m-fragment01,13,"This may L_sound L_utopian , but it has been L_borne out by the L_experience of L_existing L_telecottages ."
a1m-fragment01,14,"So M_far about 100 have been L_established , L_mainly in L_Scandinavia but L_also in L_Japan and L_several L_third M_world L_countries ."
a1m-fragment01,15,"As the L_network M_expands , so do the L_uses ."
a1m-fragment01,16,The L_first was M_opened in the L_village of L_Vemdalen in the L_remote L_forests of L_Sweden in L_September 1985 .
a1m-fragment01,17,"The M_impact , L_according to L_Henning L_Albrechsten , L_president of L_Telecottages L_International who has been L_involved in their L_development since the L_outset , was M_immediate ."
a1m-fragment01,18,"‘ By M_holding M_open L_meetings for L_children and having the L_telecottage above the L_local L_store , L_people of all M_walks of L_life L_came in - L_small-scale L_entrepreneurs and their L_spouses , L_shop L_assistants , L_craftspeople and L_children ."
a1m-fragment01,19,"Now , 15 per L_cent of the L_village M_regularly M_uses L_telecottage and at L_least 20 per L_cent has M_taken M_courses there . ’"
a1m-fragment01,20,L_Britain is M_lagging M_behind .
a1m-fragment01,21,"No L_telecottages have been L_established , but there are L_several L_initiatives in the L_offing ."
a1m-fragment01,22,The most L_advanced is a M_plan for five in the L_north of L_Scotland which will be L_funded by the L_Highlands and L_Islands L_Development L_Board and L_British L_Telecom .
a1m-fragment01,23,L_Colin L_Pavey of L_British L_Telecom L_hopes that they will be M_running by the M_end of the L_year .
a1m-fragment01,24,‘ Two would be M_business-orientated and three would be L_community-orientated and L_located in L_schools .
a1m-fragment01,25,"We are most L_interested in the L_idea of L_networking , M_sharing L_skills such as L_translation and L_using them for L_distance L_learning . ’"
a1m-fragment01,26,L_Telephone L_cables in the L_region are being L_upgraded to L_ensure they are M_capable of M_handling L_faxes .
a1m-fragment01,27,L_Mr L_Dobbs 's more L_unlikely M_allies are the L_Women 's L_Institutes .
a1m-fragment01,28,Most of the L_workers in L_telecottages and L_many of the L_users are L_women .
a1m-fragment01,29,He L_says : ‘ In L_villages there are L_many L_women with L_skills who are n't L_using them because of L_child-care L_problems .
a1m-fragment01,30,But they are L_interested in L_working .
a1m-fragment01,31,"L_Users of L_telecottages are L_given the L_key and L_people can L_use them at any L_time , which L_means that L_women can L_come in during the L_evening , L_early in the L_morning or whatever . ’"
a1m-fragment01,32,"He is L_working on a L_scheme with the L_National L_Federation of L_WI to L_organise a L_competition to L_celebrate L_next L_year 's 75th L_anniversary by L_offering 10 L_telecottages as L_prizes for its 9,000 M_branches and he is L_hoping the L_WI will L_establish a L_pilot L_telecottage near its L_college in L_Denman , L_Oxfordshire ."
a1m-fragment01,33,"While L_telecottages should L_become L_self-financing once L_established , they do L_need L_initial L_subsidy ."
a1m-fragment01,34,"The L_cost of L_providing the L_start-up L_equipment is in the L_order of £10,000 and L_Mr L_Dobbs L_thinks L_space is not L_much of a L_problem : ‘ There 's L_usually the L_village L_hall or an L_empty L_shop . ’"
a1m-fragment01,35,L_Henning L_Albrechsten M_reckons that it M_takes three L_years for a L_telecottage to be M_able to L_function without L_subsidy .
a1m-fragment01,36,"In L_Scandinavia , with their M_mixed L_economies , L_money is L_always L_available , after a M_bit of L_persuasion , from both L_local and M_central L_government ."
a1m-fragment01,37,"In L_Britain , the M_tight L_financial L_regime L_imposed on L_local L_councils and the M_reluctance of M_central L_government to M_take on any L_new L_expenditure M_makes it L_necessary to L_seek L_funds from the L_private M_sector ."
a1m-fragment01,38,"The only L_government M_support so M_far has been a L_recommendation by the L_Rural L_Development L_Commission , M_part of the L_Department of the L_Environment , to L_establish a L_pilot L_scheme ."

a1n-fragment09,204,The L_selectors L_knew they were M_playing with M_fire when they L_decided to M_arrange a M_couple of L_club M_fixtures and they have L_duly been M_consumed in a M_conflagration of their own M_making .
a1n-fragment09,205,"The L_New L_Zealanders , L_appropriately L_garbed in L_funereal L_black , L_arrive L_next L_week to M_scatter the M_ashes ."
a1n-fragment09,206,On and off the L_field the L_national L_game of the L_Land of L_Song is in a M_discordant M_mess .
a1n-fragment09,207,M_Losing was one M_thing but to M_lose as M_spinelessly as the L_Welsh L_XV did to L_Bridgend on L_Saturday was to M_add L_insult to L_severely M_injured L_pride .
a1n-fragment09,208,"‘ In all L_honesty we should have L_won by at L_least 15 M_points , ’ L_Brian L_Nicholas , the L_Bridgend M_coach , L_said ."
a1n-fragment09,209,"As if 24-17 and L_derisive M_chants of ‘ L_Easy , L_easy ’ were not L_bad L_enough , this L_humiliation was against a M_side who have M_made a M_wretched L_start to the L_season — a L_week L_earlier L_Pontypool had M_given them a 35-6 M_going-over — and were M_short of at L_least M_half-a-dozen L_first-choice L_players ."
a1n-fragment09,210,Four of the L_absentees L_suffered the M_squirming M_discomfort of being among the L_Welsh M_squad .
a1n-fragment09,211,"‘ It 's not that I do n't L_want to L_say L_anything but I just do n't L_know what to L_say , ’ L_John L_Ryan , the L_Welsh M_coach , L_sighed ."

a1n-fragment09,213,"At L_Bridgend he L_looked in L_despair , and he L_almost M_admitted as L_much : ‘ I L_hope we can L_pull it L_together but L_sometimes I have my L_doubts . ’"
a1n-fragment09,214,L_Nicholas was L_sympathetic : ‘ He is only as L_good as the L_players we M_give him . ’
a1n-fragment09,215,"But another L_selector L_confided the L_truth that L_Wales should be M_giving L_club L_opposition a M_hammering — and at M_half-time , M_building on their L_win over L_Newbridge , it M_looked as if they would ."
a1n-fragment09,216,"They had M_weathered L_Bridgend 's L_early M_fury , M_conceding a L_try before M_coming M_back with some L_confidence to M_score three of their own ."
a1n-fragment09,217,But L_Wales were having us on .
a1n-fragment09,218,From the L_comparative L_opulence of 17-6 they then M_slipped into M_penury by L_conceding 18 M_unanswered M_points .
a1n-fragment09,219,L_Bridgend M_raised their L_game against L_Wales ; now L_Wales must do L_precisely the same against L_New L_Zealand .
a1n-fragment09,220,No L_one who was at the L_Brewery L_Field ( L_perhaps not L_even the L_selectors ) would M_give M_twopence for their L_ability to do so .
a1n-fragment09,221,The M_backs were L_mainly M_pedestrian but the L_fundamental L_problem M_lay M_elsewhere .
a1n-fragment09,222,"L_Apart from L_Kevin L_Moseley 's M_steady M_supply from the L_line-out , there was L_nothing L_much to M_commend in a L_Welsh L_forward L_effort which M_reverted to the very L_worst L_Eighties L_stereotype of L_static , L_cumbersome M_donkeys only too L_willing to L_slow the L_game to L_walking L_pace ."
a1n-fragment09,223,"‘ When the M_pressure M_comes on , L_players L_revert to L_bad M_habits , ’ L_Ryan L_said ."
a1n-fragment09,224,"The All L_Blacks would L_treat such an L_outmoded M_approach with the L_scorn it M_deserves , although on the other M_hand they might have been L_impressed with L_Bridgend 's L_contrasting M_mobility and M_aggression ."
a1n-fragment09,225,"The L_back L_row were M_swifter to the M_loose L_ball , had a M_clearer L_idea of what to do with it when they L_got there , and their L_impressive L_half-backs were M_given every L_opportunity — which they L_eagerly M_took — to M_control the L_game ."
a1n-fragment09,226,This was L_conveniently M_encapsulated in the L_first L_try .
a1n-fragment09,227,"L_Wales , L_characteristically , M_delayed the L_heel at a L_scrum , M_putting L_Robert L_Jones in L_trouble when the L_ball L_finally L_emerged ."
a1n-fragment09,228,"He was L_scragged by L_Mike L_Budd , L_Jeremy L_Cooper L_came L_away with the L_ball , L_Owain L_Williams L_acted as the M_link , and L_Kevin L_Ellis M_scored : three L_back-row L_forwards and their M_scrum-half in L_perfect M_harmony ."
a1n-fragment09,229,"L_Wales 's L_instant M_reaction , a L_try by L_Arthur L_Emyr , and L_subsequent M_steady L_improvement , M_bringing M_well-crafted L_tries for L_Emyr and L_Robert L_Jones , M_promised more than was L_later L_fulfilled ."
a1n-fragment09,230,"In the L_third M_quarter L_Bridgend had L_little L_difficulty in M_wiping out an 11-point L_deficit , L_Huw L_Bevan M_supporting L_Aled L_Williams 's M_break for their L_second L_try ."
a1n-fragment09,231,It was a L_magnificent L_fightback and such was L_Welsh M_distress that they L_never L_looked like L_preventing it .
a1n-fragment09,232,"‘ We have M_taken a M_step M_backward , ’ L_Ryan L_said — and on this M_sorry L_evidence it M_looks as if it will be M_backwards all the M_way when the L_Test M_takes M_place at L_Cardiff L_Arms L_Park on 4 L_November ."

a1n-fragment18,336,By L_PATRICK L_BARCLAY
a1n-fragment18,337,HOW TO L_describe L_Saturday 's L_match between L_Chelsea and L_Arsenal ?
a1n-fragment18,338,"L_Well , I L_seem to M_recall a L_London L_gallery M_exhibiting a L_pile of L_rubbish , which was M_considered M_valid L_art by the L_proprietors and M_drew a M_large L_attendance ."
a1n-fragment18,339,"The only M_redeeming L_feature of a L_goalless , L_worthless L_event at L_Stamford L_Bridge was that it did not L_require a L_grant ."
a1n-fragment18,340,"L_Yet the L_Chelsea L_manager , L_Bobby L_Campbell , and L_Arsenal L_assistant , L_Theo L_Foley , L_agreed it had been a L_good L_match , and the L_spectators ' L_complaints were M_muted ."
a1n-fragment18,341,Some L_even L_applauded the L_players at the M_end .
a1n-fragment18,342,It M_takes all L_sorts .
a1n-fragment18,343,"L_Bobby L_Robson was there to M_assess L_World L_Cup L_candidates , but L_nothing L_positive M_emerged from 90 L_minutes of M_scuffling that M_made one L_almost L_yearn for the more L_measured L_boredom of L_Rangers ' L_European L_Cup M_exit in L_Munich three L_days L_earlier ."
a1n-fragment18,344,At L_least the L_outcome was L_appropriate .
a1n-fragment18,345,"Had either of the L_teams M_won , they would have M_taken the L_League M_leadership ."
a1n-fragment18,346,L_Instead L_Liverpool M_stayed M_top without L_kicking a L_ball .
a1n-fragment18,347,"L_Television had M_postponed L_Manchester L_United 's L_scheduled M_visit to L_Anfield so it could be L_shown M_live on 22 L_December , the M_longest L_night ."
a1n-fragment18,348,"L_London 's M_leading L_pair , as if M_piqued by this , M_turned 30 L_September into the M_longest L_afternoon ."
a1n-fragment18,349,On and on it M_dragged .
a1n-fragment18,350,"L_Lacking a L_goal that might have L_altered its M_chemistry , it L_remained a L_matter of M_dull M_physics ."
a1n-fragment18,351,"L_Yet L_many of the L_crowd were M_kept L_interested by the L_possibility of L_victory , which is , I L_suppose , what L_derbies are about ."
a1n-fragment18,352,"They are so L_frequent these L_days in L_London , which has eight of 20 L_First L_Division L_clubs , that we must L_expect L_aesthetic L_considerations to be L_overridden ."
a1n-fragment18,353,"Why , L_though , could these L_supposed L_championship L_contenders not have L_tried to L_emulate the M_fine M_passing that had M_sprinkled the L_previous L_weekend 's L_Merseyside M_joust ?"
a1n-fragment18,354,"The M_simple M_answer is that L_Chelsea are in a L_false M_position and L_Arsenal , on this L_evidence , L_slightly L_jaded L_champions ."
a1n-fragment18,355,"They ought to have M_pocketed three M_points in the L_first M_half-hour but L_Tony L_Adams , a more L_threatening L_centre-forward on his M_forays than the L_current L_Alan L_Smith , L_missed the L_target with two L_headers and L_David L_Rocastle L_let L_Dave L_Beasant M_save a L_penalty , L_much as the M_stretch-version M_keeper had done for L_Wimbledon in the 1988 L_FA L_Cup L_final ."
a1n-fragment18,356,Now an L_Arsenal L_team in M_peak M_health would have M_kept a M_grip on the L_match .
a1n-fragment18,357,This L_one could not .
a1n-fragment18,358,"As L_George L_Graham M_indicated upon his M_side 's M_accession to the M_title , they would L_need more L_composure and L_sophistication to L_match L_Liverpool in the M_longer L_term ."
a1n-fragment18,359,He L_chose not to L_hasten the L_process by L_buying .
a1n-fragment18,360,"After all , he had just the L_man on his L_staff ."
a1n-fragment18,361,But L_Paul L_Davis L_remains L_unfit .
a1n-fragment18,362,"His L_absence is L_increasingly L_conspicuous and L_Liverpool , for the L_moment , in a L_super L_league of one ."
a1n-fragment18,363,"L_Davis , of L_course , would have M_walked into L_England 's L_team in L_Poland a L_week on L_Wednesday ; until L_last L_season 's L_prolonged M_suspension , M_followed by L_injury , L_Bobby L_Robson had him M_firmly L_pencilled in as L_Bryan L_Robson 's L_replacement ."
a1n-fragment18,364,"L_Michael L_Thomas , L_several L_years L_younger , is not L_quite in the same M_class L_yet but may have to L_play in L_Chorzow ."
a1n-fragment18,365,"If so , it will be a L_gamble , because he M_flopped on his only L_previous L_international L_appearance in L_Saudi L_Arabia ."
a1n-fragment18,366,"The L_odds are L_favourable L_enough L_according to L_Chelsea 's L_Mike L_Hazard , who L_said of his L_adversary : ‘ He could L_cope in L_Poland , not just because of his L_ability to M_close L_people down and L_use the L_ball L_well , but L_temperament — you M_saw when he L_scored the L_goal that M_won L_Arsenal the L_League . ’"
a1n-fragment18,367,"Very L_kind , but L_international L_players are L_supposed to be L_habitually L_influential , and it was L_Hazard who in the L_second M_half , with a few L_incisive L_passes , M_gifts from the M_heavens on a L_day like this , M_left a M_greater M_mark ."
a1n-fragment18,368,L_Chelsea might have M_won had the L_ball not M_kept M_turning into a L_Mexican M_bean at L_Kerry L_Dixon 's L_feet .
a1n-fragment18,369,"L_Campbell 's M_hard-working M_side are L_still M_trying to M_sort out their M_system , which L_involves a M_spare L_defender and , as M_far as one can M_see , a L_good M_deal of L_improvisation ."
a1n-fragment18,370,"It should M_suit L_Tony L_Dorigo , the L_unblooded L_England M_left-back , though L_oddly his L_rival , L_Nigel L_Winterburn , did more L_rampaging on L_Saturday ; neither , in L_truth , M_made the M_heart M_pound ."
a1n-fragment18,371,L_Dorigo at L_least had the L_satisfaction of L_seeing his M_direct L_opponent and L_England L_colleague L_David L_Rocastle M_withdrawn .
a1n-fragment18,372,"All in all , L_Bobby L_Robson must have M_found it about as M_fruitful as a L_day L_trying to M_get in L_touch with L_Brian L_Clough ."
a1n-fragment18,373,"There was , L_however , one M_aspect that M_deserves L_commendation ."
a1n-fragment18,374,"After 16 L_minutes L_Graham L_Roberts was L_injured by a L_tackle for which L_Perry L_Groves was L_booked ( L_Steve L_Clarke L_took over as M_sweeper , and is L_likely to have L_several L_weeks in which to M_build on a L_promising M_display ) ."
a1n-fragment18,375,"L_Roberts 's L_ankle L_appeared L_broken , but the L_Chelsea L_players were not L_interested in L_retribution and the L_club , as L_soon as they M_knew the L_injury was L_less M_serious , M_put a L_message on the L_electronic L_scoreboard : an L_example of L_public L_relations from which L_others could L_learn ."

a1p-fragment01,2,"From L_ANDREW L_BROWN , L_Religious L_Affairs L_Correspondent , in L_Rome"
a1p-fragment01,3,"THE L_ARCHBISHOP of L_Canterbury , L_Dr L_Robert L_Runcie , M_exchanged a L_symbolic L_kiss of L_peace with L_Pope L_John L_Paul L_II L_yesterday at a L_mass L_attended by L_thousands in L_St L_Peter 's L_Square , L_Rome ."
a1p-fragment01,4,"But L_Dr L_Runcie 's L_ideas of a L_limited L_primacy — L_recognising the L_Pope as a M_central L_figure in the L_Christian L_Church , who would M_exercise ‘ a L_primacy for the L_sake of L_unity and L_mission ’ — have been L_rejected as L_insufficient by the L_Pope ."
a1p-fragment01,5,"They have L_also M_aroused L_Protestant L_anger against L_Dr L_Runcie , at the same L_time as he has L_become L_involved in a L_row over his M_attack on the ‘ M_Pharisees ’ of L_British L_society ."
a1p-fragment01,6,"Though Dr Runcie and his L_party could not M_take L_Holy L_Communion at the L_papal L_mass , he had L_earlier L_celebrated the L_eucharist at the L_Anglican L_church in L_Rome after three L_demonstrators L_rose from the L_congregation as he L_ascended the L_pulpit ; the L_visit has been M_dogged by L_protests from L_supporters of the L_Rev L_Ian L_Paisley ."
a1p-fragment01,7,"In his L_sermon , L_Dr L_Runcie L_said : ‘ We should L_ever L_recognise the L_scandal that L_Anglicans and L_Roman L_Catholics must L_celebrate two L_eucharists to M_make one L_memorial of our L_redemption on the L_day of our M_Lord . ’"
a1p-fragment01,8,L_Dr L_Runcie has M_gone out of his M_way on this L_visit to L_concede L_many of the L_doctrinal M_points and L_practices which M_large M_elements of the L_Church of L_England have L_traditionally M_found L_offensive in L_Roman L_Catholicism .
a1p-fragment01,9,"The L_Pope , too , has L_spoken M_warmly of L_unity ."
a1p-fragment01,10,"On L_Saturday the two L_prelates L_attended a M_service of L_vespers at the L_Church of L_San L_Gregorio , which M_stands on the L_site where L_Pope L_Gregory L_sent L_St L_Augustine of L_Canterbury off to L_become the L_first L_Archbishop of L_Canterbury in 597 ."
a1p-fragment01,11,But in their L_prepared L_homilies the L_Pope and the L_Archbishop M_addressed L_quite L_different L_problems .
a1p-fragment01,12,"L_Dr L_Runcie L_repeated his L_offer of a L_limited L_primacy , L_involving the L_limited M_powers M_exercised by the L_popes in the L_first few L_centuries of the L_Christian L_Church ."
a1p-fragment01,13,"L_However , the L_Pope 's M_account of the M_role of the L_papacy M_went a L_great L_deal M_farther than that : L_Christian L_unity , he L_said , must be M_founded on the L_faith in L_Christ that was M_handed on by the L_Apostles ; what this L_faith is must be L_determined by the L_Roman L_Catholic L_Church ."
a1p-fragment01,14,He L_quoted the L_Second L_Vatican L_Council : ‘ The L_task of M_giving an L_authentic L_interpretation of the L_Word of L_God … has been L_entrusted to the L_living M_teachting L_office of the L_Church M_alone .
a1p-fragment01,15,"The L_specific M_role of L_bishops which is to be M_exercised in M_communion with the M_see of L_Peter in L_ensuring the L_unity and L_continuity of the L_faith is M_vital if we are to M_hand on the L_faith of L_Peter , L_Gregory and L_Augustine ."
a1p-fragment01,16,All our L_efforts to M_restore L_unity among L_Christians will be in L_vain if they are not L_carried out in L_total L_fidelity to the L_faith in L_Christ … M_handed on by the L_Apostles . ’
a1p-fragment01,17,In a L_statement L_afterwards L_Dr L_Runcie M_stressed that he was not L_proposing any M_change in the L_British M_constitution .
a1p-fragment01,18,‘ The L_phrase ‘ L_universal L_primacy ’ has a L_spiritual L_meaning .
a1p-fragment01,19,"It does not L_imply L_political L_supremacy , and does not L_suggest that the L_Pope should L_administer the L_affairs of the L_Church of L_England , ’ he L_said ."
a1p-fragment01,20,Both L_prelates L_referred to the L_consecration in L_February of the L_Rt L_Rev L_Barbara L_Harris as the L_Anglican L_Assistant L_Bishop of L_Massachussetts .
a1p-fragment01,21,L_Bishop L_Harris is L_quite L_unacceptable to the L_Vatican .
a1p-fragment01,22,The L_Pope L_said : ‘ L_Events in L_recent L_years have L_seriously M_aggravated the L_differences between us . ’
a1p-fragment01,23,"The L_Independent has M_learnt that 1,800 L_American L_Roman L_Catholic L_nuns L_wrote L_last L_winter to L_Dr L_Runcie , L_urging him to L_defy the L_Pope over the L_ordination of L_women ."
a1p-fragment01,24,"M_Sister L_Margaret L_Traxler , of the L_National L_Coalition of L_American L_Nuns , L_said that she had L_told L_Dr L_Runcie : ‘ The L_Roman L_Catholic L_Church M_says this is a L_deterrent to L_unity ; but we L_say , how can this be a L_deterrent to L_unity when L_discrimination against L_women is M_evil ? ’"

a3c-fragment05,189,L_THANK L_God it 's L_Saturday .
a3c-fragment05,190,"I L_know that L_today is L_Saturday because L_already I am L_thirsty for a M_dry , L_hoppy L_pint of L_bitter at the M_end of the L_afternoon : an L_aperitif to M_sharpen my L_appetite for this L_evening 's L_Indian L_meal ."
a3c-fragment05,191,How did you M_feel as you M_came to the M_end of your L_working L_week L_yesterday L_afternoon ?
a3c-fragment05,192,"L_Boy , I had a L_thirst ."
a3c-fragment05,193,"We L_say we are L_thirsty when we L_mean that we L_fancy a L_glass of L_wine , a L_pint of L_beer , a L_gin and L_tonic or a M_shot of L_whisky — the L_pleasure of L_naming our M_poison — at the M_end of a M_busy L_day or L_tiresome L_week ."
a3c-fragment05,194,That is not L_thirst .
a3c-fragment05,195,"To L_enjoy it , we do not L_need to be M_dry : just in L_need of a L_restorative or L_relaxant , or L_maybe a M_focus for a L_social L_moment or M_brief L_encounter ."
a3c-fragment05,196,We L_call it ‘ L_thirst ’ in L_lieu of a more M_accurate L_description .
a3c-fragment05,197,"No , not more M_accurate : ‘ L_thirst ’ is not M_accurate at all as a L_description for this L_apparently L_indescribable L_condition ."
a3c-fragment05,198,"It is a L_desire L_millions of us L_know and M_share , L_yet for which we have no L_name ."
a3c-fragment05,199,"This L_desire that can not M_find its L_name ( though it would M_dare M_speak it , if it could ) is L_pleasurable ."
a3c-fragment05,200,It is as L_enjoyable as M_feeling M_gently L_hungry or M_amorous .
a3c-fragment05,201,"No , not L_amorous : randy — we have a L_word for that ."
a3c-fragment05,202,Any of these L_conditions is L_pleasurable so L_long as there is a L_good L_likelihood of L_satisfaction in L_reasonably M_short M_order .
a3c-fragment05,203,"L_Let M_puritans and L_pessimists L_damn , L_disapprove or M_dismiss these M_appetites ; that is their M_loss ."

a3c-fragment05,206,"L_Peckishness and L_lust , L_perhaps ?"
a3c-fragment05,207,Or does that L_sound like a M_firm of M_country M_solicitors ?
a3c-fragment05,208,This is to L_digress .
a3c-fragment05,209,What of this L_thirst that can be M_satisfied by an M_unquenching L_drink ?
a3c-fragment05,210,"L_Wine is not M_quenching , but no L_less in L_demand for that ."
a3c-fragment05,211,"L_Try to M_quench your L_thirst with a M_light , L_fresh L_white and you will L_drink L_enough to M_put you on your M_back ."
a3c-fragment05,212,"L_Beer is , L_quite L_rightly , L_Britain 's L_favourite L_Friday L_night L_drink ."
a3c-fragment05,213,"It can L_momentarily M_blunt a L_thirst , but not L_altogether M_cut it ."
a3c-fragment05,214,The M_nearest to being M_quenching is the ‘ L_white ’ L_beer of L_Berlin .
a3c-fragment05,215,L_Anything with L_even a M_modest M_smack of L_hops M_dries the L_palate M_ready for the M_next one .
a3c-fragment05,216,"So , of L_course , does L_alcohol itself ."
a3c-fragment05,217,"It may for a L_moment L_seem to M_quench but it L_dehydrates , as L_purportedly L_healthy L_abstainers are L_forever L_telling me ."
a3c-fragment05,218,"To M_quench is more than to L_refresh although our M_lying , M_lascivious L_eyes M_tell us the two are the same ."
a3c-fragment05,219,"Does any L_drink L_look more M_quenching than one of those L_Italian or L_French L_patent L_aperitifs , M_swirling in a L_refractive L_pink or L_russet M_oiliness , M_clothing the L_melting L_ice : a L_Campari , L_Dubonnet , L_Lillet or ( too L_rare in this L_country ) a L_Picon ?"
a3c-fragment05,220,Are they M_quenching ?
a3c-fragment05,221,"No , L_refreshing ."
a3c-fragment05,222,"In L_Strasburg , they have been L_known to M_lace L_beer with L_Picon , L_thereby L_ruining both L_drinks ( as L_Queen L_Victoria L_reputedly did with L_claret and L_malt L_whisky ) , but L_still the L_result is not L_especially M_quenching ."
a3c-fragment05,223,"L_Perhaps a L_shimmering M_dry L_Martini L_cocktail ( L_minimum L_dilution , L_stirred , not L_shaken ; and L_served M_straight up ) L_looks L_even more L_refreshing , though its L_effect is that of a M_silver M_mallet ."
a3c-fragment05,224,"In the L_right L_place ( L_possibly L_New L_York , but L_San L_Francisco is L_better ) , the L_Martini is the L_ultimate ‘ L_Thank L_God it 's L_Friday ’ L_drink ."
a3c-fragment05,225,"The L_requirement for such L_pleasures is a L_matter of L_time and L_place , and it does not have to be L_Friday , L_Berlin or L_Strasburg , L_New L_York or L_San L_Francisco ."
a3c-fragment05,226,"Not L_feeling L_thirsty , but L_fancying a L_drink , has a M_world of L_moments ."
a3c-fragment05,227,Some L_Frenchmen L_start the L_day with a L_coffee and L_calvados .
a3c-fragment05,228,The L_people of L_Munich L_call their L_version of L_Weissbier ‘ L_breakfast L_beer ’ and have it with a L_pair of L_coddled L_veal L_sausages .

a3c-fragment05,231,"If it is at an L_elegant L_dinner L_table , there is a L_choice between a L_fino L_sherry ( or a L_manzanilla ) or L_champagne ."
a3c-fragment05,232,L_None of these L_requires L_anything L_even M_approaching a L_thirst .
a3c-fragment05,233,Do we L_really ‘ M_wash down ’ a L_good L_meal with L_claret ?
a3c-fragment05,234,L_Port is L_immediately M_suggested by L_Stilton ; L_cognac by L_coffee .
a3c-fragment05,235,"I do not L_fully L_appreciate the L_experience of an L_American L_late-night L_movie without a L_bourbon , or a L_book at L_bedtime without a L_single L_malt ."
a3c-fragment05,236,These are not L_moments of L_thirst … but nor are they L_causes of L_drunkenness ( unless L_one L_tries to M_pack all such L_experiences into one L_day ) .
a3c-fragment05,237,We do not L_drink because we are L_thirsty .
a3c-fragment05,238,"Nor , if we are in L_civilised M_cast of L_mind , because we L_wish to L_become L_drunk ."

a3c-fragment05,241,"If it were only a L_matter of L_alcohol , would a L_body M_care ?"
a3c-fragment05,242,L_People will L_nevertheless L_say that the L_desire is for L_nothing more than L_alcohol .

a3e-fragment03,24,By L_ANNA L_PAVORD
a3e-fragment03,25,L_PLANTS should M_come a M_long M_way down the M_list of L_priorities for the M_novice L_gardener .
a3e-fragment03,26,There are L_many M_things to L_think about before L_even the L_first L_tentative L_daffodil L_bulb is M_sunk into the L_ground .
a3e-fragment03,27,The L_first and most L_important L_question to L_mull over as you L_gaze at your L_patch is : What is this L_garden for ?
a3e-fragment03,28,"If you L_start L_writing down some of the L_responses to that L_question , you will M_find you have along the M_way L_acquired a M_ragbag of M_elements that will have an L_important M_bearing on the L_design ."
a3e-fragment03,29,"If there are L_small L_children in the M_equation , there will L_need to be a L_flat , L_soft L_area where they can L_fall off L_swings and L_climbing L_frames ."
a3e-fragment03,30,"If you L_like L_hanging out L_washing L_rather than L_drying it in the M_bowels of an L_expensive L_machine , you will L_need to L_tuck L_away a L_line and L_make a L_dry L_path to L_get to and from it ."
a3e-fragment03,31,"Some M_novice L_gardeners may not L_want to do L_much L_actual L_gardening at all , but L_conversely , do not L_want to L_look out every L_day over a L_scene of M_threadbare L_grass and L_rotting L_fence ."
a3e-fragment03,32,Their L_ideal L_garden will L_look L_good and M_demand L_little L_attention .
a3e-fragment03,33,"If you are a L_dedicated L_sun-worshipper , you L_need to M_mark out the L_part of the L_garden where the L_sun M_lingers L_longest ."
a3e-fragment03,34,"It may not be the L_part nearest the L_house , though this is where L_sitting out L_areas L_always L_tend to be L_made ."
a3e-fragment03,35,"You may , L_even as a M_novice , L_care so L_passionately about L_plants that all you L_want is the L_maximum L_space to L_grow them in ."
a3e-fragment03,36,L_Raised M_beds L_built down an L_unpromising L_alley could L_provide L_extra L_gardening L_space .
a3e-fragment03,37,L_Privacy is an L_important L_consideration .
a3e-fragment03,38,A L_first L_time L_garden is L_usually L_small and L_certainly the L_typical one I am L_imagining for this L_series is no more than 40ft x 20ft and L_surrounded on all L_sides by other L_houses .
a3e-fragment03,39,L_Privacy is a M_ticklish L_business where M_close L_neighbours are L_concerned .
a3e-fragment03,40,To L_throw up an L_impenetrable M_Berlin M_Wall between you and them could be L_tactless .
a3e-fragment03,41,L_Trellis is a L_useful L_compromise and you can L_always L_pretend it was M_forced on you by the L_speed of L_growth of your M_climbing L_rose .
a3e-fragment03,42,L_Aesthetes among the M_novices will by now be L_thoroughly L_irritable and L_complaining that L_gardens should have as L_much to do with the L_soul as with the L_necessity or not of a L_washing L_line or a L_barbecue L_pit .
a3e-fragment03,43,"So they should , and when the L_list of L_necessities is L_securely L_written down , you can L_ask the L_second L_question : How do I L_want this L_garden to M_feel ?"
a3e-fragment03,44,This L_question M_produces as L_varied a L_response as the L_first .
a3e-fragment03,45,"Some L_urban L_gardeners , as M_short of L_space L_inside as they are out , L_want their L_gardens to be L_extensions of their L_homes , with a M_great M_deal of L_hard L_paving , L_good L_furniture and L_lighting ."
a3e-fragment03,46,"The L_garden for them should M_feel like an L_extra L_sitting L_room , L_gnat-ridden L_perhaps , L_damp L_occasionally , but an L_important M_overflow of L_living L_space ."
a3e-fragment03,47,L_Closet L_countrysiders may L_want to L_pretend their L_patch is L_actually a L_corner of some L_Sussex L_meadow and M_picture it M_swagged with L_honeysuckle and M_waving with M_ox-eye L_daisies and L_scabious .
a3e-fragment03,48,This is a L_difficult L_trick to L_bring off with L_suburban L_trains L_hurtling by on one L_side and L_lorries M_grinding through their L_gears on the other .
a3e-fragment03,49,"A L_leafy M_retreat is an L_excellent M_goal for a L_small L_town L_garden , but it is L_best L_made L_acknowledging the L_urban L_setting , L_using L_un-wild L_plants such as L_bamboo , L_acanthus , L_fig , L_vine , L_alchemilla , L_euphorbia , L_wisteria ."
a3e-fragment03,50,"While you are L_working through this L_process , M_take M_note of the L_features in the L_garden that you would L_like to L_keep ."
a3e-fragment03,51,"On a L_new L_estate , there may be L_nothing ."
a3e-fragment03,52,"In an M_old L_garden , there may be a L_fruit L_tree , or a L_good L_bulwark of L_evergreen L_laurel or L_box that , L_tidied up , could M_add a L_dash of M_venerability to the L_new L_garden that will M_emerge around it ."
a3e-fragment03,53,"If you do not L_know what a L_tree or L_shrub is , M_exercise L_clemency and M_give it a L_year 's L_grace to L_demonstrate its M_worth before you M_turn it over to the L_axeman ."
a3e-fragment03,54,The M_mood of the L_garden will M_dictate its L_eventual L_style .
a3e-fragment03,55,"It may be L_clipped L_classical , L_random L_cottage , L_modern L_high-tech , or some L_intensely L_personal M_vision of L_Byzantium , that no L_one has L_ever L_imagined before , but which L_exists in your L_head and M_wants to M_get out ."
a3e-fragment03,56,"Do not L_let L_anybody , L_particularly L_gardening L_writers , M_tread on your M_dreams ."
a3e-fragment03,57,"All this L_thinking and L_doodling will have done L_nothing L_physically to L_change the L_view outside the L_window , but it is a M_vital M_part of the L_gardening L_process ."
a3e-fragment03,58,"Before you can L_make , you have to L_know what it is you are L_making ."
a3k-fragment11,109,"L_Property : L_Houses that are M_going , M_going , M_gone : L_Fed up with L_trying to L_sell , more L_people are L_auctioning their L_home L_instead ."

a3k-fragment11,112,"IN THE L_small L_Devon L_town of L_South L_Molton , L_Julie L_Widlake is L_waiting with L_anticipation for L_Friday 20 L_October ."
a3k-fragment11,113,"She and her L_boyfriend have had their L_future M_planned for some L_time : they L_want to L_start L_farming in a L_nearby L_village , where they L_also L_intend to L_build a L_bungalow ."

a3k-fragment11,121,"L_Bristol and L_West M_claims these L_auctions will M_help to M_bring some M_action to an L_otherwise M_slow M_market , and M_says it was M_overwhelmed by the M_response from L_people L_wanting to L_sell in this M_way ."

a3k-fragment11,127,"‘ L_Many L_people have L_suffered from L_sales L_falling through and from L_house-buying M_chains , and some of our L_vendors M_feel that now 's as L_good a L_time as any to L_sell . ’"

a3k-fragment11,129,"The L_problem is that L_normally L_potential L_purchasers have to L_incur the L_expense of L_undertaking M_surveys and M_arranging L_mortgage L_finance , without any L_idea whether they will be L_able to L_afford the L_final L_selling L_price ."
a3k-fragment11,130,"Not L_surprisingly , L_several L_estate L_agents L_report L_difficulties at the L_moment in M_attracting L_enough L_serious L_bidders ."
a3k-fragment11,131,"‘ With an L_auction , you 've L_got to be L_certain that at L_least two L_buyers are there who can M_commit themselves , and the L_difficulty is that L_buyers who can M_proceed are few and M_far between , ’ L_said L_David L_Phillip , a L_director of L_Yorkshire L_estate L_agents L_Dacre L_Son and L_Hartley ."
a3k-fragment11,132,L_Bristol and L_West M_hopes that by M_arranging L_collective L_auctions it will be M_able to L_overcome this L_problem .

a3p-fragment09,164,The L_tourists are L_right .
a3p-fragment09,165,L_East L_Anglia on a L_sunny L_weekend is a L_place of L_matchless L_beauty .
a3p-fragment09,166,Its L_villages L_look too L_good to be L_true .
a3p-fragment09,167,"L_Lavenham and L_Long L_Melford , for L_example , have no L_telegraph L_poles , to M_preserve the L_timeless M_air that M_pervades them ."
a3p-fragment09,168,"Yet you only have to L_read L_Ronald L_Blythe 's L_Akenfield to L_realise that these L_picturesque , L_half-timbered L_cottages , L_often L_painted the L_characteristic L_Essex L_pink ( L_pale L_salmon ) , L_ochre or L_spring-leaf L_green , are more L_prosperous now than L_ever in the ‘ L_real ’ L_past ."
a3p-fragment09,169,"L_Many are L_still L_elaborately L_decorated with L_pargeting , an L_ornate , L_patterned L_plasterwork L_practised in this L_area since the L_early L_thirteenth L_century ."
a3p-fragment09,170,"Most of L_East L_Anglia 's L_prosperity L_today is L_due to L_City L_commuters , the L_second-homes M_market and L_tourism ."
a3p-fragment09,171,"The L_ideal L_hotel from which to L_explore is L_Dedham L_Hall , L_set among L_tall L_trees in the L_Vale of L_Dedham , M_looking L_directly across towards L_Dedham L_church on one L_side and L_Flatford L_Mill on the other : both L_painted by L_Constable ."
a3p-fragment09,172,"The L_hotel M_lies in five L_acres of L_fields and L_garden , and the L_Slingos , who own it , M_make the most of their L_beautiful L_surroundings by M_running L_painting M_courses for about £200 a L_week ( M_including L_breakfast and L_dinner ) , or £90 for a M_long L_weekend ."
a3p-fragment09,173,These are so L_popular that you will L_need to L_book at L_least a M_couple of L_months in M_advance .
a3p-fragment09,174,The other M_great L_joy of L_Dedham L_Hall is the L_food .
a3p-fragment09,175,"The L_Slingos have their own L_vegetable L_garden , L_chickens , L_ducks , L_sheep and L_cows ."
a3p-fragment09,176,"L_Everything is L_home-grown , L_home-made and L_fresh : it L_tastes like L_forgotten L_food ."
a3p-fragment09,177,"If L_Dedham L_Hall is L_fully L_booked — and it may L_well be — L_try the L_best L_bed-and-breakfast we have L_ever L_found , just a few L_miles L_away at the L_Old L_Vicarage , L_Higham , near L_Colchester ."
a3p-fragment09,178,"It is a L_rambling L_Tudor L_house M_run by L_John and L_Margaret L_Parker , whose L_breakfast L_room and L_drawing L_room M_look out over a L_wonderful L_walled L_garden , beyond which L_fields of L_grazing L_cows M_stretch down to the L_river ."
a3p-fragment09,179,Another L_hotel that would M_make a L_good M_starting M_point for a L_weekend — or L_longer — in L_East L_Anglia is the L_Black L_Lion at L_Long L_Melford .
a3p-fragment09,180,It M_changed M_hands L_recently and is now M_run by L_Stephen and L_Janet L_Errington .
a3p-fragment09,181,"After L_dinner there , when the L_moon was M_full and L_low and M_deep L_orange , we L_walked up the L_road from the L_hotel to L_Long L_Melford L_church ."
a3p-fragment09,182,"Its L_vast L_walls of L_flint and L_glass and L_Gothic L_tracery were L_brilliantly L_floodlit and the L_churchyard L_cat , L_sleek and L_black as L_tar , M_greeted us M_querulously and M_led us L_right L_round the L_church and through the L_gravestones at the M_back , L_glimmering and M_pale in the L_moonlight ."
a3p-fragment09,183,"We were L_quite L_alone and the L_great L_church , the L_size of a L_cathedral , was L_unearthly in its L_floodlit , L_moonlit L_beauty ."

a3p-fragment09,185,"Another is at L_Lavenham , 10 L_minutes ' L_drive up the L_road ."
a3p-fragment09,186,"Just inside the L_front L_porch , a L_handwritten L_book is L_prefaced with the L_words ‘ This L_book has been L_compiled that L_something , more than their L_mere L_names , may be L_known of the L_Lavenham L_men who M_gave their L_lives for their L_country in the M_Great L_War . ’"
a3p-fragment09,187,"This is M_followed by 50 or so L_names , each with a L_description ."
a3p-fragment09,188,"The L_much-thumbed L_book is M_deeply M_moving , and M_sets the M_tone for a L_walk L_round this L_glorious L_building , which has M_seen the L_christenings , L_marriages and L_burials of the L_folk of the L_village for more than 600 L_years ."
a3p-fragment09,189,L_East L_Anglia is L_exceptionally M_rich in L_churches and L_cathedrals .
a3p-fragment09,190,There are L_several L_splendid L_houses near L_Long L_Melford that would M_make for a M_gentle L_afternoon 's L_potter through the L_rooms and L_possessions of the L_rich of a few L_centuries L_ago .
a3p-fragment09,191,"The L_loveliest , to my L_mind , is L_Melford L_Hall , whose L_charming , L_octagonal L_Jacobean L_gatehouse is L_reached along an L_avenue of L_clipped L_yew L_trees and , with its L_high L_windows M_flooding the L_octagon with L_light , is my L_fantasy of the L_ideal L_study ."
a3p-fragment09,192,L_Lavenham is L_often L_called the M_finest L_medieval L_village in L_England .
a3p-fragment09,193,"It is an M_image of the L_world we have M_lost , its M_gently L_sloping L_streets L_converging upon the L_market L_place ."
a3p-fragment09,194,"Here M_stand the L_early L_sixteenth-century L_timbered L_Guildhall , now a L_museum to 700 L_years of the L_cloth L_industry ."
a3p-fragment09,195,"L_Next to it is The L_Little L_Hall , L_dating from the L_fourteenth L_century , with its L_floorboards L_gleaming with the L_patina of L_age , L_low-beamed L_ceilings and a L_tiny , M_unruly , L_charming L_walled L_garden ."

a3p-fragment09,198,The L_wine L_list is M_small but L_perfectly L_chosen .
a3p-fragment09,199,The L_service is L_impeccable .
a3p-fragment09,200,L_East L_Anglia has L_bookshops L_filled with L_titles like 101 L_Things For A L_Boy To Do …

a4d-fragment02,72,By L_GAVIN L_STAMP
a4d-fragment02,73,"FROM the L_top of the L_dome of L_St L_Paul 's L_Cathedral the L_view is no L_longer M_dominated by L_City L_church L_steeples but by an L_intrusive M_cacophony of L_drab , L_characterless L_Sixties L_boxes ."
a4d-fragment02,74,One L_building L_stands out in this L_dispiriting L_panorama of L_post-war L_mediocrity : a M_dark M_powerful L_mass of L_brickwork with a L_tall L_central L_tower that M_stands L_right across the L_Thames from L_Wren 's L_dome .
a4d-fragment02,75,"This is not an L_office L_block , nor a L_church — although its L_sublime L_form might M_suggest that its L_architect was L_adept at L_designing L_cathedrals ."
a4d-fragment02,76,"It is , in L_fact , the now L_redundant L_oil-fired L_electric L_power L_station that M_sits on L_Bankside L_next to the L_site of L_Sam L_Wanamaker 's L_new L_Globe L_Theatre ."
a4d-fragment02,77,L_Bankside L_Power L_Station should L_never have been L_built .
a4d-fragment02,78,"Its L_architect had M_spent the L_war L_years with L_fellow L_Royal L_Academicians L_planning the L_orderly and L_spacious L_London of the L_future , M_free of L_smoke and L_industry ."
a4d-fragment02,79,"But , when L_asked in 1947 to L_replace an L_old L_dirty L_power L_station that had been on the L_site since 1891 , he L_soon M_forgot such L_idealism and , like any L_architect , was L_glad to have the L_job ."
a4d-fragment02,80,The L_project was L_controversial and the L_power L_station was only L_permitted L_providing the L_smoke was L_clean and the L_building did not M_challenge the L_visual L_dominance of L_St L_Paul 's .
a4d-fragment02,81,"So the L_single L_chimney M_rose only to 325ft , some 45ft below the L_height of the L_cross above the L_cathedral ."
a4d-fragment02,82,"The L_irony is that had the L_tower been L_higher and had the L_teak ‘ L_scrubbers ’ been L_less L_efficient , the L_smoke would have M_gone L_straight up into the L_air ."
a4d-fragment02,83,"As it was , the ‘ L_smokeless L_shimmer of L_vapour ’ was so L_cooled by L_cleaning that it L_drifted across the L_river to L_cause M_mischief with the L_leadwork on L_Wren 's L_great L_dome ."
a4d-fragment02,84,L_Bankside L_Power L_Station should not have been L_built .
a4d-fragment02,85,"But , as it was L_built , it should not now be L_demolished ."
a4d-fragment02,86,"That is because it is a L_magnificent L_structure , the L_supreme L_architectural L_expression of the M_heroic , M_monumental L_phase of L_power L_station L_design and the M_creation of a M_great L_architect ."
a4d-fragment02,87,"L_Bankside was the L_work of L_Sir L_Giles L_Gilbert L_Scott , L_OM , the L_architect of L_Liverpool 's L_Anglican L_Cathedral , the L_rebuilt L_House of L_Commons and some of the L_last M_vital L_products of the L_Gothic L_Revival ."
a4d-fragment02,88,"He was a L_designer of L_extraordinary L_versatility , being L_responsible for the L_standard ‘ L_traditional ’ L_red L_telephone L_kiosk , L_Waterloo L_Bridge and L_several L_power L_stations ."
a4d-fragment02,89,L_Bankside L_represents the M_fullest L_realisation of his L_industrial L_aesthetic .
a4d-fragment02,90,"L_Scott 's L_first L_venture into this L_unlikely M_field of L_design was at L_Battersea where , in 1930 , he was M_wheeled in as a L_famous L_knighted L_architect by the L_London M_Power L_Company to L_try to M_make L_acceptable the L_coal-fired L_monster L_power L_station to which the L_residents of L_Chelsea and L_Westminster were M_taking M_strong L_exception ."
a4d-fragment02,91,This was a M_brilliant M_move .
a4d-fragment02,92,"L_Scott was so L_successful in L_styling the L_building in L_fine L_brickwork with ‘ L_jazz-modern ’ L_fluting ( as L_John L_Betjeman L_called it ) that , when the L_Battersea ‘ A ’ L_station was M_opened in 1934 it was L_widely L_acclaimed as a L_supremely L_successful L_modern L_treatment of a L_building L_type that L_seemed L_quintessentially L_twentieth L_century ."
a4d-fragment02,93,"When , in 1939 , The L_Architects ' L_Journal M_conducted a M_survey to M_find what were M_considered the L_best L_modern L_buildings in L_Britain , L_Battersea was M_placed L_second — and was the L_favourite of such L_unlikely L_celebrities as L_Sir L_Kenneth L_Clark , L_Rebecca L_West and L_Charles L_Laughton ."
a4d-fragment02,94,"L_Scott was so L_pleased with the L_style he had M_evolved at L_Battersea , a L_treatment that M_humanised L_industrial L_forms without L_denying their L_function , that he L_also L_used it on the L_Guinness L_Factory at L_Park L_Royal , L_west L_London ."
a4d-fragment02,95,"At L_Battersea , L_Scott could not L_alter the L_basic L_design of the L_building and he L_much L_disliked the ‘ M_upturned M_table ’ L_appearance L_created by the four L_corner L_chimneys ."
a4d-fragment02,96,"At L_Bankside , L_however , he was L_able to L_persuade the L_engineers , L_Mott , L_Hay & L_Anderson , to M_gather all the L_flues into a L_single ‘ M_slender L_tower or L_campanile ’ ."
a4d-fragment02,97,"As a L_result , he was L_able to L_create a L_symmetrical , L_monumental L_composition of M_great M_power ."
a4d-fragment02,98,"As at all his L_power L_stations , L_Scott M_faced the L_building in a L_fine L_Worcestershire L_brick that has L_weathered to a L_lovely L_pinky-brown ."
a4d-fragment02,99,But there is L_nothing L_homely about the L_general L_effect .
a4d-fragment02,100,L_Vast L_overlapping L_planes of L_brickwork are L_modelled with L_careful L_set-backs and L_subtle L_bands of L_detail .
a4d-fragment02,101,"The L_result is an L_expression of the M_monumental L_aesthetic of the L_early L_twentieth L_century , with M_strong L_American L_overtones ."

a4d-fragment02,103,Not for L_nothing were such L_power L_stations L_described as ‘ L_brick M_cathedrals ’ ; L_Bankside is the L_finest L_manifestation of this L_tradition .

a4d-fragment02,107,"Such L_re-use is , of L_course , L_much M_encouraged by a L_building being L_listed , L_something which , until L_recently , was not L_possible with L_architecture of so L_recent a L_date ."

a6u-fragment02,166,The 1990s have M_witnessed a L_shift in the L_art L_establishment 's M_attitudes towards L_art L_produced M_outside of its L_traditional L_parameters .
a6u-fragment02,167,The L_work of L_previously L_marginalised L_artists has L_become an M_area of M_rich L_speculation among L_art L_dealers L_priced out of the ‘ L_modern L_masters ’ M_market .
a6u-fragment02,168,"L_Almost every L_year has M_witnessed the L_discovery of L_new L_artistic M_terrain — graffiti L_art , L_Soviet L_art , L_Australian L_art , the L_art of L_Latin L_America ."
a6u-fragment02,169,The L_major L_auction L_houses have M_moved with the L_times and have M_found L_new M_ways of L_selling L_works which in both L_form and M_content would have L_proved an M_unstable L_investment a L_decade L_ago .
a6u-fragment02,170,The L_current M_status of the L_work of the L_Mexican L_painter L_Frida L_Kahlo is a M_dramatic L_example of this L_change .
a6u-fragment02,171,"Once L_known L_primarily as the L_wife of L_Diego L_Rivera , her L_reputation outside of L_Mexico now M_far L_supercedes his : since 1919 , L_sale L_room L_estimates of her L_work have M_risen from $40,000 to over $1 million , and in 1990 a L_work by L_Kahlo M_broke all L_records at L_Sotheby 's L_New L_York for a L_Latin L_American L_artist ."
a6u-fragment02,172,The M_enormous M_rise in the L_economic L_value of her L_work has L_developed in M_tandem with the M_increased L_critical and L_popular M_response to her L_particular M_blend of M_naive L_style and L_incisive M_content .
a6u-fragment02,173,"While the L_first M_wave of L_popular L_interest M_arose with the 1982 L_Whitechapel L_exhibition L_instigated by L_Laura L_Mulvey and L_Peter L_Wollen , it was the L_publication of L_Hayden L_Herrera 's L_biography of L_Kahlo in 1983 which has M_led to her L_current L_cult L_status ."
a6u-fragment02,174,"Since that L_date she has been the L_subject of L_TV L_documentaries , a L_feature L_film ( ‘ L_Frida ’ by L_Paul L_Leduc ) , a L_stage L_play , L_numerous L_publications and the L_inspiration for L_designer L_clothing ."

a6u-fragment02,176,"L_Almost as a L_logical L_outcome of this L_media M_blitz , it M_emerged in the L_summer of 1990 that L_Madonna , L_already a M_devotee of L_Kahlo 's L_work , was L_commissioning a L_screenplay M_based on L_Kahlo 's L_life ."

a6u-fragment02,179,"As with most L_artists who have L_become M_mythical L_personalities in the L_popular L_imagination , such L_attention has M_focused L_primarily on the L_anecdotal and M_tragic L_details of L_Kahlo 's L_admittedly L_fascinating L_life ."
a6u-fragment02,180,"The L_passionate L_obsession with her L_husband L_Diego L_Rivera , her L_flamboyant L_appearance , but most of all her L_physical and L_emotional L_pain have M_come to M_dominate M_responses to her L_work ."
a6u-fragment02,181,"While L_Kahlo 's L_art M_helped her to M_deal with the L_vicissitudes of her L_life , for most M_audiences it is her L_life L_story which M_allows M_access to her L_art ."

a6u-fragment02,183,The L_archetypal dropout/spiritualist L_became an L_appropriate M_icon for the L_sixties L_revival of 1990 's M_long L_hot L_summer .
a6u-fragment02,184,"L_Yet despite the L_iconic M_status of L_Van L_Gogh 's ‘ M_tragic ’ L_life , it is the L_appearance of his L_work by which he is L_ultimately L_signified , his L_thick L_impasto L_brush-stroke , his M_vibrant L_yellows , the L_urgency of his L_creative M_drive ."
a6u-fragment02,185,"In the L_case of L_Kahlo the L_popular M_image is of the L_artist herself , the L_characteristic L_brows , the L_elaborate L_hair , the L_Mexican L_costume ( Fig. 3 ) ."
a6u-fragment02,186,"It is L_primarily her L_appearance , not the M_formal M_language of her L_art , that has M_graced the L_pages of L_Elle and L_Vogue L_magazines ."
a6u-fragment02,187,The L_Elle L_feature M_transposed the ‘ L_Kahlo L_style ’ to L_Kahlo L_lookalikes in L_contemporary L_clothing M_balanced around M_segments of L_Herrera 's L_biography of the L_artist .
a6u-fragment02,188,"In the L_later L_Vogue M_piece only the L_style L_remained as the M_far more L_overtly L_sexual , L_Kahloesque M_models L_lounged and L_pouted in their ‘ L_Mexican ’ L_interiors ."
a6u-fragment02,189,"There is a L_poignant L_irony in the M_way L_clothing , which on one M_level M_served to L_hide L_Kahlo 's M_broken L_body , L_falls or is L_lifted by the M_model to L_reveal a L_luxuriantly L_perfect L_physique ( Fig. 4 ) ."
a6u-fragment02,190,The L_visual L_references in the two L_magazines are as L_much from L_photos of the L_artist as from her L_work .
a6u-fragment02,191,"In both L_features she is L_also M_seen to L_embody a M_wider M_set of L_assumptions about L_Mexico itself ; L_exotic , L_passionate , yet L_constantly M_struggling against L_pain and L_deceit ."
a6u-fragment02,192,"While L_Elle , L_Vogue and L_subsequently The L_Independent ( Fig. 5 ) , M_stressed L_different M_facets of L_Kahlo 's L_public L_persona , they all M_shared the M_emphasis on ‘ her ’ , as an M_encapsulisation of M_stereotypical M_images of Mexico , L_rather than her L_work ."

a6u-fragment02,200,The L_majority of her L_work is L_self L_portraiture ; her L_aesthetic L_concerns M_grew from her L_fascination with the L_falsity of L_appearance .

a6u-fragment02,203,"More L_disturbingly , in The Mask ( 1945 ) ( Fig. 7 ) , she M_throws L_doubt on too L_straightforward a M_reading of her L_self-portraits as M_revealing of her M_inner L_emotions ."
a6u-fragment02,204,Where does the M_mask M_fall : Does not the M_ritual L_repetition of those L_familiar M_features ‘ M_mask ’ L_far more than it M_uncovers ?
a6u-fragment02,205,"There is , L_however , an L_inevitable L_logic to the M_appropriation of her L_meticulously M_constructed M_image , a L_process which the L_artist was L_mocking as L_early as 1933 : ‘ … some of the L_gringa L_women are L_imitating me and L_trying to L_dress ‘ a L_la L_Mexicana ’ , but the M_poor L_souls only L_look like M_cabbages and to L_tell you the M_naked L_truth they L_look L_absolutely L_impossible . '"
a6u-fragment02,206,"The ‘ M_impossibility ’ M_stemmed from the L_failure of such L_followers to M_recognise the L_symbolic L_importance of L_Kahlo 's L_choice of L_clothing , a L_failure L_also L_intrinsic to her L_recent L_magazine L_appearances ."
a6u-fragment02,207,"The L_particularities of L_post-revolutionary L_Mexico are L_frequently L_subsumed by the L_decorativeness of the L_ethnic , by the L_generalised M_attractiveness of the L_radical L_avant-garde ."
a6u-fragment02,208,"For L_Kahlo , L_however , M_choosing to don the L_costume of the L_Tehuana , as for L_example in L_Tree of L_Hope ( 1946 ) ( Fig. 8 ) , was to L_embody a M_powerful M_icon of L_cultural L_identity ."

a6u-fragment02,211,It is the L_mythology M_surrounding the L_women L_wearers of the L_costume which M_directed L_Kahlo 's L_choice .
a6u-fragment02,212,"The L_ostensibly L_matriarchal L_society of L_Tehuantepec M_led to the M_adoption of the L_Tehuana , in L_post-revolutionary L_Mexico , as the M_image of the L_strong L_Indian L_woman ; the L_undefeated L_counterpart to the L_despised ‘ L_Chingada ’ , who , L_conversely is the L_female L_embodiment of L_Mexico 's M_hybrid L_post-conquest L_culture ."
a6u-fragment02,213,"In a L_culture where L_sexual L_metaphors are L_frequently L_used to M_convey L_racial and L_political L_conflict , the L_Tehuana M_represents that M_aspect of L_Mexico 's M_indigenous L_tradition M_unbowed by L_centuries of L_colonial and L_male M_rule ."
a6u-fragment02,214,"L_Kahlo 's M_adoption of L_Tehuana L_dress , while being an M_attractive M_disguise of what she M_saw as a L_less than L_perfect L_body , M_asserted both a L_feminist and an L_anti-colonialist M_position ."

a7s-fragment03,40,By L_Hugh L_Hebert
a7s-fragment03,41,THERE was one M_point when the L_hair on the M_back of my L_head L_began to L_lift .
a7s-fragment03,42,"Not at L_Paul L_Hill 's L_remembrance of L_beatings M_past , when he could L_hear the L_sound of L_steel-tipped L_boots M_running to M_take M_part in the L_fun , and once L_heard a L_principal L_medical L_officer , no L_less , L_telling L_colleagues : ‘ Do n't L_walk his L_face , do n't L_walk his L_face . ’"
a7s-fragment03,43,"Not L_even the L_time he was L_dunked L_head L_first in a L_tub of L_dubious L_liquid , and L_brought up L_gasping for L_breath : ‘ Make him L_sing L_God L_Save the L_Queen ! ’ they L_shouted ."
a7s-fragment03,44,"L_Brutality , as L_Hill L_describes and M_felt it , was a M_bitter M_part of his L_prison L_life ; you just L_learnt to L_get down on the L_floor as L_fast as you could and L_cover up as L_best you could ."
a7s-fragment03,45,But it was L_Gerry L_Conlon 's M_account of being L_interrogated after the L_Guildford L_bombings that M_made the L_scalp M_crawl .
a7s-fragment03,46,"We L_know your L_mother L_works at the L_Royal L_Victoria L_Hospital , they L_told him , we L_know where your L_sister L_works , and there are L_sectarian L_killings down there ."
a7s-fragment03,47,‘ They L_told me they could M_arrange an ‘ L_accident ’ .
a7s-fragment03,48,"And I L_believed they were L_capable of L_murdering my L_mother , I L_honestly L_believe they would have L_murdered my L_mother — that 's why I L_signed the L_statement . ’"
a7s-fragment03,49,The M_account he M_gave just after his L_release was that the L_threat had been that a L_British L_soldier might ‘ L_accidentally ’ L_shoot one of the L_women .
a7s-fragment03,50,"A few L_months L_ago L_even , this would have L_seemed L_improbable ."
a7s-fragment03,51,You might have M_assumed this was the L_police M_bluffing and M_bullying .
a7s-fragment03,52,"L_Yet L_given what we have L_learned about M_links between the L_security L_services and the L_Loyalist L_paramilitaries in L_Northern L_Ireland , and the M_deep L_suspicion about L_surrogate L_murders , you ca n't M_shrug off the L_shiver L_Conlon 's L_words M_bring ."
a7s-fragment03,53,"There were L_daunting L_moments in L_last L_night 's L_First L_Tuesday ( L_Yorkshire ) , but few of them M_matched that M_hint of a M_jackboot under the M_blue M_serge ."
a7s-fragment03,54,"It 's L_right that the L_Guildford L_Four have L_told their L_stories now to L_Grant L_McKee and L_Ros L_Franey and L_First L_Tuesday , the L_programme and the L_producers who M_dug M_away , and did L_much to M_keep the M_case M_alive ."
a7s-fragment03,55,"And they L_told it without L_on-screen L_questioning , though the L_programme is L_skilfully L_structured to M_give it a L_coherence it might have L_lacked ."
a7s-fragment03,56,L_Carole L_Richardson 's is the most L_haunting L_face .
a7s-fragment03,57,You have to L_hope that its M_blankness will L_slowly M_dissolve and M_let L_life in .
a7s-fragment03,58,Just once a L_couple of L_tears L_rolled down .
a7s-fragment03,59,"It was when she L_described L_seeing L_film of the L_results of the L_bombing on L_television , and L_thinking : ‘ They L_think I did that ! ’"
a7s-fragment03,60,L_Armstrong L_seems the L_least L_permanently M_damaged on the M_surface .
a7s-fragment03,61,"He M_pays M_tribute to his L_treatment at L_Gartree L_prison , he L_apologises to the L_bomb L_victims ' L_families that they have had to L_keep L_reminding them of their M_loss : ‘ But we had to M_fight for our L_freedom . ’"
a7s-fragment03,62,"L_Hill M_expresses the M_way L_time has M_cheated them : his L_daughter was L_born while he was L_remanded in L_custody , and is now 14 : ‘ She would M_change M_dramatically and I did n't M_feel a M_change in myself L_mentally ."
a7s-fragment03,63,I 'm L_still 20 in my L_head .
a7s-fragment03,64,L_Nothing 's L_happened to me .
a7s-fragment03,65,I have n't L_lived . ’
a7s-fragment03,66,"But again it was L_Conlon , the L_slightly L_wild-eyed L_Irish L_poet of the L_quartet , L_articulate , L_flamboyant — L_remember that L_extraordinary L_exit through the L_front L_door of the L_Old L_Bailey — who M_cut M_deep into the L_collective M_conscience ."
a7s-fragment03,67,"He L_described being L_taken over the L_years to L_see his L_sick , and L_finally L_dying and L_almost L_certainly L_innocent L_father in another L_prison ."
a7s-fragment03,68,He was L_convicted with the L_Maguires in the M_parallel L_case of a ‘ L_bomb L_factory ’ .
a7s-fragment03,69,And he L_tells how L_none of the L_assembled L_guards and L_officials could L_look his L_father in the L_eye as he L_protested his L_innocence .
a7s-fragment03,70,Only the L_nurses could do that .
a7s-fragment03,71,"And at the M_end , L_Conlon M_drew the one L_hopeful L_conclusion : ‘ If this L_stops L_capital L_punishment L_ever M_coming M_back , the L_time I 've M_spent in L_prison will be L_well M_worth it ."
a7s-fragment03,72,"If this L_stops another L_innocent L_person L_going to L_prison , it 'll be L_well M_worth it …"
a7s-fragment03,73,"‘ I 've had L_numerous L_prison L_governors L_say to me , L_Yes , L_Conlon , we L_know you 're L_innocent , but there 's L_nothing we can do about it ."
a7s-fragment03,74,"We M_get a L_custody L_order , and that 's it ."
a7s-fragment03,75,What L_sort of M_system of L_justice is that ? ’
a7s-fragment03,76,IT was n't the only L_programme L_last L_night to M_shine M_light into M_dirty M_corners .
a7s-fragment03,77,"Inside The L_Brotherhood ( L_Granada ) , L_produced by L_Claudia L_Milne and L_Martin L_Short , M_dug into the most L_notorious M_area of L_Masonic L_influence , L_local L_government ."
a7s-fragment03,78,"In L_Southend , where 3,000 of the 50,000 L_adult L_males are M_reckoned to be L_Masons , it M_went into the L_case of what you might L_call L_Preferential L_Allocation of L_Council L_Property , and the M_battle of one L_councillor , L_Christopher L_Hudson , to M_break the M_grip of the L_men on the L_Square : ‘ We ca n't have a L_secret L_society M_operating within the M_framework of a L_democracy , ’ he L_said ."
a7s-fragment03,79,"‘ It 's a L_paradox , it 's a L_nonsense . ’"
a7s-fragment03,80,"Though over the L_years , from L_Southend to L_Tyneside and the L_Government 's own L_Property L_Services L_Agency , there 's all too L_much L_evidence that this is L_exactly what we do have ."

a7y-fragment03,173,The L_tenant is not L_obliged to L_ensure that the L_landlord is L_aware of the L_defects in the L_premises or to M_give the L_landlord an L_opportunity to L_remedy the L_defects before L_commencing L_legal L_proceedings .
a7y-fragment03,174,"Although that is the M_position in L_law , the L_court M_emphasised that as a L_matter of commonsense a L_tenant should L_first L_complain to the L_landlord before M_exercising the L_right to L_prosecute ."
a7y-fragment03,175,The L_facts .
a7y-fragment03,176,L_Mrs L_Bujok and her L_family L_occupied a L_house as L_council L_tenants .
a7y-fragment03,177,In L_September 1988 L_Mrs L_Bujok M_laid an L_information against the L_council L_alleging the L_existence and L_continuance of a L_statutory L_nuisance under M_section 92(1) of the L_Public L_Health L_Act 1936 .
a7y-fragment03,178,"It was L_alleged that the L_council , being the L_owners of the L_premises , were the L_persons by whose L_act , L_default or L_sufferance the L_nuisance M_arose ."
a7y-fragment03,179,L_Prior to M_laying the L_information L_Mrs L_Bujok had not M_served an L_abatement L_notice upon the L_council or L_informed them of the L_alleged L_defects in the L_premises .
a7y-fragment03,180,The L_justices M_held L_Mrs L_Bujok was not L_required to L_ensure that the L_council were L_aware of the L_defective L_state of the L_property L_prior to M_laying the L_information .
a7y-fragment03,181,The L_council M_appealed by L_case L_stated .
a7y-fragment03,182,The L_legislation .
a7y-fragment03,183,M_Section 92(1) of the 1936 L_Act M_defines ‘ L_statutory L_nuisances ’ as ‘ any L_premises in such a L_state as to be L_prejudicial to L_health or a L_nuisance ’ .
a7y-fragment03,184,The L_decision .
a7y-fragment03,185,L_Mr L_Justice L_Hutchison L_said the 1936 L_Act L_primarily M_envisages a M_system where the L_local L_authority has a M_power and a L_duty to M_try to M_secure that L_premises are not in a L_state which L_constitutes a L_statutory L_nuisance .
a7y-fragment03,186,M_Action is M_initiated by the M_service of an L_abatement L_notice L_requiring M_remedial L_work .
a7y-fragment03,187,If the L_person in L_default L_fails to L_comply with an L_abatement L_notice the L_local L_authority is M_obliged to M_make a L_complaint to the L_magistrates .
a7y-fragment03,188,"If the L_complaint is L_proved , a L_nuisance L_order is M_made L_requiring the L_defendant to M_get the L_necessary L_work done ."
a7y-fragment03,189,L_Effectively the L_sequence is that the L_person in L_default is L_told what is L_wrong and is L_required to M_put it L_right .
a7y-fragment03,190,"He is M_given an L_opportunity to do so , and if he does not , he is L_subject to L_sanctions by the L_court to L_compel him to do so ."
a7y-fragment03,191,The L_problem M_arises in L_connection with M_section 99 which M_adapts or M_applies the L_provisions to L_cases where an L_individual L_rather than the L_local L_authority L_wishes to M_make the L_complaint .
a7y-fragment03,192,L_Need he M_serve an L_abatement L_notice ?
a7y-fragment03,193,The L_authorities M_plainly L_establish that he L_need not and can not do so .
a7y-fragment03,194,Does that M_mean he may M_lay an L_information and M_bring the L_matter before the L_magistrates without L_first M_putting the L_person L_alleged to be in L_default on L_notice of what is L_alleged ?
a7y-fragment03,195,"The L_council M_argued that a L_landlord , L_particularly one such as a L_local L_authority , can not L_realistically be L_expected to have a M_system of L_inspection of all its L_premises and in L_practice is M_entitled to L_depend upon L_notification by its L_tenants ."
a7y-fragment03,196,For L_Mrs L_Bujok it was L_argued that the 1936 L_Act was M_designed to M_secure in the M_interests of the M_community at L_large that L_statutory L_nuisances did not L_exist .
a7y-fragment03,197,"It was L_submitted that an L_owner can not M_turn his M_back on his L_property because when he L_purchases and L_takes on the L_responsibility of L_letting , he L_knows the L_property will in the M_course of L_time L_deteriorate ."
a7y-fragment03,198,He must L_therefore L_satisfy himself on a M_regular L_basis that it does not L_constitute a L_statutory L_nuisance .
a7y-fragment03,199,"In L_Warner v L_Lambeth L_London L_Borough L_Council ( 1985 ) 15 L_HLR 45 , 50 , L_Lord L_Justice L_Glidewell L_said a L_private L_person could M_lay an L_information L_alleging the L_failure to L_abate a L_statutory L_nuisance without L_first M_giving L_notice L_requiring L_abatement ."
a7y-fragment03,200,L_Therefore in the L_present L_case the L_justices M_came to the L_correct L_conclusion .
a7y-fragment03,201,"His L_Lordship M_reached that L_decision without L_enthusiasm because it L_seemed that as a L_matter of L_common M_sense , L_notice should be M_given in such L_circumstances before L_criminal L_proceedings were M_launched ."
a7y-fragment03,202,L_Lord L_Justice L_Watkins L_said he L_agreed with L_reluctance .
a7y-fragment03,203,It was L_surely L_repugnant to commonsense that in this M_area of L_legal L_activity a L_local L_authority should be L_prosecuted by one of its L_tenants without L_first being M_given the L_opportunity by that L_tenant to L_remedy the L_consequences of a L_neglect to L_repair the L_dwelling that the L_tenant L_occupied .
a7y-fragment03,204,In L_law there was no L_doubt that L_Mrs L_Bujok was M_entitled to L_commence L_proceedings without M_giving L_notice of the L_state of the L_dwelling to the L_council .
a7y-fragment03,205,But in every other L_conceivable M_way that M_action was L_entirely L_wrong .
a7y-fragment03,206,L_Endless L_trouble to L_many L_people in L_courts and L_council M_offices and L_much L_money could be M_saved by the M_giving of L_notice of L_disrepair .
a7y-fragment03,207,"If the L_council did not M_react to that L_notice , then would be the L_time for the L_tenant to M_exercise the L_right to L_prosecute ."
a7y-fragment03,208,L_Parliament should M_give M_fresh L_thought to M_enacting a L_provision M_placing an L_obligation upon a L_council L_tenant to M_give L_notice to the L_council before being L_permitted to L_commence L_proceedings .

a8r-fragment02,23,If you do n't L_know what the L_system is L_required to do ; you do n't L_know L_anything .
a8r-fragment02,24,But L_many L_system L_developers are L_unable to M_assess L_requirements L_properly .
a8r-fragment02,25,They L_seem to L_think that you can L_ask a L_businessman what his L_requirements are and M_get an L_answer that M_amounts to a L_draft L_system L_specification .
a8r-fragment02,26,A M_doctor does n't M_ask his M_patient what M_treatment to M_prescribe .
a8r-fragment02,27,The M_patient can M_explain only what the M_problem is .
a8r-fragment02,28,It is the M_doctor that M_provides the M_remedy .
a8r-fragment02,29,If you L_ask a L_user what L_sort of L_system he L_wants you will be M_met with a M_blank L_look .
a8r-fragment02,30,"A L_user may have a M_deep L_knowledge of L_business L_problems , but L_knowing L_little about L_computers , has no L_idea how they should be M_tackled ."
a8r-fragment02,31,"L_Yet , L_analysts are L_heard L_asking L_time and again , ‘ L_Tell me what you L_want ."

a8r-fragment02,33,"But of L_course the L_users do n't L_know what they L_want , so they L_end up L_getting another L_duff L_system ."
a8r-fragment02,34,An L_effective L_analyst L_provides the same M_service to the L_business as the M_doctor M_provides to the M_patient .
a8r-fragment02,35,"He L_finds out what the M_needs of the L_business are , and M_prescribes the M_cure ."
a8r-fragment02,36,"The L_user L_tells the L_analyst what the L_problems are , and the L_analyst L_decides , at L_least in M_broad M_terms , what the L_user L_requires ."
a8r-fragment02,37,But the L_analyst has one M_great L_advantage over the L_doctor .
a8r-fragment02,38,"Once the L_user L_becomes M_familiar with the L_proposed L_system , M_helpful L_comments M_come M_thick and M_fast ."
a8r-fragment02,39,"‘ Oh , this will be of M_great L_help in L_ordering M_raw L_materials , but L_sometimes we L_get L_part L_deliveries , could we have an L_extra M_facility to M_deal with those ?"

a8r-fragment02,41,And what about L_orders not L_delivered on L_time ?
a8r-fragment02,42,If we could L_list those we 'd have L_advance L_warning of L_shortage L_problems on the L_assembly L_lines two L_months before they L_occur .
a8r-fragment02,43,Now that would be a M_great M_leap M_forward . ’
a8r-fragment02,44,L_Unfortunately you can not M_reach this M_stage until you have L_developed a L_prototype L_system .
a8r-fragment02,45,And you ca n't L_develop a L_prototype L_system because the L_users have n't M_got a M_clue what they L_want .
a8r-fragment02,46,"Most of them are L_probably L_muttering , ‘ I 'm too L_busy to L_get L_involved in this L_sort of M_thing ."
a8r-fragment02,47,What 's L_wrong with the L_old L_system L_anyway ? ’
a8r-fragment02,48,"The only M_way to L_develop a L_prototype is for the L_analyst to M_get inside the L_head of the L_user and , L_thinking like a L_user , L_decide what L_sort of L_system is L_required ."
a8r-fragment02,49,"Of L_course , the L_initial L_system will not be L_perfect ."
a8r-fragment02,50,The L_analyst can not L_hope to L_understand the L_business as L_well in a few L_weeks as the L_user does after L_many L_years .
a8r-fragment02,51,"But once the L_user M_sees the L_system , M_channels of L_communication will M_open ."
a8r-fragment02,52,"L_Instead of L_persuading the L_user to L_specify L_requirements , the L_analyst will be M_driven by the L_user to M_meet L_key L_needs ."
a8r-fragment02,53,L_Good L_system L_development M_goes through two M_distinct M_phases .
a8r-fragment02,54,"L_Initially the L_analyst does all the L_work , M_leading the L_user towards a L_system he L_thinks is L_right for the L_business ."
a8r-fragment02,55,"But once the L_user M_sees the L_potential of the L_system , a M_change in M_attitude M_takes M_place ."
a8r-fragment02,56,The L_process L_becomes L_demand L_driven by the L_user .
a8r-fragment02,57,"The L_analyst is then M_forced on the M_defensive , L_explaining why M_new M_features can not be L_included because they are L_technically L_difficult or M_prohibitively L_expensive ."
a8r-fragment02,58,"L_Traditionally , L_systems were L_validated by L_users L_agreeing L_functional L_specifications ."
a8r-fragment02,59,"In L_theory , L_validation M_meant that the L_user had L_read the L_specification , L_imagined how the L_system would M_work in L_practice , and L_agreed the M_design ."
a8r-fragment02,60,"It was only when L_using a ‘ L_test ’ L_version of the L_system ( L_available just before the M_planned L_implementation L_date ) that L_difficulties would M_come to M_light , and a L_host of M_change L_requests be L_issued ."
a8r-fragment02,61,The L_advent of L_fourth M_generation M_languages ( 4GLs ) has M_made L_system L_development L_much L_easier .
a8r-fragment02,62,With a 4GL an L_initial L_prototype can be M_put M_together L_quickly .
a8r-fragment02,63,"This M_means M_feedback is L_obtained L_early in the L_development L_process , and the L_system can M_grow around the L_user 's L_requirements ."
a8r-fragment02,64,L_Crucial to the L_development L_process is the L_relationship M_built up between the L_analyst and the L_user .
a8r-fragment02,65,The L_best L_systems M_arise when both have a M_deep L_understanding of each other 's L_jobs .
a8r-fragment02,66,L_Many L_developers M_use L_business L_analysts to L_ensure that the L_development M_team M_maintain a L_proper M_focus on L_business L_requirements .
a8r-fragment02,67,"But this can be L_counter-productive , as it M_cuts off L_communication between the L_systems L_analyst and the L_user ."
a8r-fragment02,68,Too L_much L_specialisation is L_bad for L_systems L_development ; it M_feeds the L_temptation to L_get L_engrossed in L_technical L_difficulties and L_forget about the M_underlying L_business L_needs .
a8r-fragment02,69,"If you should L_stroll into a L_pub and L_meet an L_analyst and a L_user L_talking about L_work , and you can not M_tell one from the other , they have L_probably L_developed a M_successful L_system M_together ."
