a1j-fragment33,494,The L_Labour L_Party L_Conference : L_Policy L_review M_throws a M_spanner in the L_Whitehall M_machinery
a1j-fragment33,495,"By L_COLIN L_HUGHES , L_Political L_Correspondent"
a1j-fragment33,496,AN M_INCOMING L_Labour L_government would M_turn L_large L_areas of L_Whitehall M_upside down — but the L_party 's L_policy L_review L_barely M_considers the L_implications of its M_plans for L_restructuring L_government L_departments .
a1j-fragment33,497,"M_Scattered through the L_policy L_review are L_proposals to : L_Drastically L_alter the M_status and L_organisation of the L_Department of L_Trade and L_Industry ; L_Create two L_departments — a L_Department of L_Consumer L_Affairs , and a L_Department for L_Legal L_Administration ; L_Create a L_Department of L_Environmental L_Protection within the L_existing L_Department of the L_Environment ; M_Set up a L_plethora of L_new L_commissions and L_executive L_agencies ; M_Set up a L_Women 's L_Ministry ."
a1j-fragment33,498,Those are only the most L_overt L_changes L_advocated in the L_review L_papers .
a1j-fragment33,499,The only L_department which L_explicitly M_escapes L_unscathed is the one which L_Conservatives would most L_like to L_abolish : the L_Department of L_Energy .
a1j-fragment33,500,"In L_virtually every L_case the M_aim of L_causing L_upheaval is L_explicitly L_declared , because L_Labour 's M_aim would be to M_upset the L_bureaucratic M_order it M_inherits ."
a1j-fragment33,501,"L_New L_departments and L_quangos would , L_according to the L_review , be M_designed to M_act as M_irritants and L_antagonists within the L_Civil L_Service M_system ."
a1j-fragment33,502,"But the L_policy L_review M_nowhere M_considers the L_overall L_effect of the L_individual L_changes L_proposed , or how they might be M_co-ordinated ."
a1j-fragment33,503,Nor does it M_contemplate the L_knock-on L_consequences for L_Labour L_ministers of L_attempting to L_implement their L_programme while M_rebuilding the L_governmental M_machine .
a1j-fragment33,504,"The ‘ L_medium L_term L_industrial L_strategy ’ which would L_form the M_centrepiece of L_Labour 's L_economic L_policy would , L_according to the L_Productive and L_Competitive L_Economy L_review L_group , be ‘ L_administered by a L_transformed L_Department of L_Trade and L_Industry ’ ."
a1j-fragment33,505,"The L_review M_adds : ‘ What we now M_seek is a L_DTI which will have an L_equal , if not L_superior M_status , to that of the L_Treasury . ’"
a1j-fragment33,506,That M_approach would M_seek to M_knock out a M_keystone of L_Civil L_Service L_tradition .
a1j-fragment33,507,L_Labour L_policy has L_long M_sought to M_challenge the L_Treasury 's L_dominance in L_government .
a1j-fragment33,508,"But its L_last L_effort — the L_Department of L_Economic L_Affairs , M_set up by L_Harold L_Wilson and M_headed by L_George L_Brown — L_ended in L_futile L_departmental and L_ministerial L_infighting ."
a1j-fragment33,509,"There would in L_addition be a L_minister for L_Science and L_Technology at the L_newly M_supreme L_DTI , with L_responsibility for M_determing L_investment in L_research ."
a1j-fragment33,510,There is no M_mention in the L_education L_policy of how that might L_affect the L_Department of L_Education and L_Science .
a1j-fragment33,511,"But while the L_DTI would M_override the L_Treasury , a L_new ‘ M_powerful L_Department of L_Consumer L_Affairs ’ would M_antagonise the L_DTI ."
a1j-fragment33,512,It would be M_headed by ‘ a L_minister of L_Cabinet M_rank ’ and M_act as ‘ the L_consumers ’ M_voice with other L_government L_departments ' .
a1j-fragment33,513,"Its L_remit for L_inter-departmental M_intrusion would be M_wide , with ‘ a M_watching M_brief over L_government L_action ’ and the M_ability to L_initiate L_consumer L_legislation ."
a1j-fragment33,514,Only the L_Women 's L_Ministry would be M_given L_equal L_license .
