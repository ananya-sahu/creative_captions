"a1e-fragment01","1","Latest corporate unbundler reveals_-0.273 laid-back approach_0.03 : Roland Franklin , who is leading_-0.03 a 697m pound break-up bid for DRG , talks to Frank Kane"
"a1e-fragment01","2","By FRANK KANE"
"a1e-fragment01","3","IT SEEMS that Roland Franklin , the latest unbundler to appear in the UK , has made_-0.242 a fatal_0.182 error in the preparation of his £697m break-up bid for stationery and packaging group DRG ."
"a1e-fragment01","4","He has not properly investigated the target_-0.031 's dining facilities ."
"a1e-fragment01","5","The 63-year-old head_0.091 of Pembridge Investments , through which the bid is being mounted_0.161 says , ‘ rule_-0.257 number one in this business is : the more luxurious the luncheon rooms at headquarters_0.182 , the more inefficient the business ’ ."
"a1e-fragment01","6","If he had taken_-0.353 his own rule seriously , he would have found out that DRG has a very modest_0.485 self-service canteen at its Bristol head_-0.118 office ."
"a1e-fragment01","7","There are other things_-0.324 he has , on his own admission_0.125 , not fully investigated , like the value of the DRG properties , or which part_-0.265 of the DRG business he would keep_-0.212 after the break up ."
"a1e-fragment01","8","When the bid was launched_0.212 last week , Mr Franklin faced_-0.182 some criticism from City commentators on both those counts_0.029 ."
"a1e-fragment01","9","He regards_-0.03 the charges_-0.029 as unfounded ."
"a1e-fragment01","10","On property , he is blunt_0.229 ."
"a1e-fragment01","11","‘ I do not regard_0.257 property profits as earnings ."
"a1e-fragment01","12","We have made_-0.258 a bid of nearly £700m for a company with a book value of £200m — we 've acknowledged there is some extra worth there_-0.375 , but I can not see_-0.5 the sort of value they are talking about in property ."
"a1e-fragment01","13","If they can prove it is there_-0.2 , we might pay for it , ’"
"a1e-fragment01","14","On the other criticism he is equally dismissive ."
"a1e-fragment01","15","‘ That point_-0.176 about the core business is very unfair , ’ he says ."
"a1e-fragment01","16","It is difficult to decide when you are an outsider what the business is like ."
"a1e-fragment01","17","We would eventually like to do it along with the management , within the philosophy we will impose . ’"
"a1e-fragment01","18","The Franklin philosophy was learnt in the US leveraged buyout business at the side_0.219 of Sir James Goldsmith ."
"a1e-fragment01","19","Mr Franklin went there at the end_-0.588 of the 1970s , after the collapse_0.143 of Keyser Ullman , the merchant bank where he was a director that was rescued by the Bank of England ."
"a1e-fragment01","20","He feels_-0.212 that Keyser 's problems were hastened by an unwise acquisition ."
"a1e-fragment01","21","He went to the US because ‘ Goldsmith decided that if you wanted to be a capitalist the UK and France were not the places to be ’ ."
"a1e-fragment01","22","Along with Sir James he found_0.03 the US much more attractive_-0.059 , taking over and breaking_0 up some fairly hefty_0.379 US corporations ."
"a1e-fragment01","23","He rejects charges_0 that he was partly responsible for the ‘ casino_0.25 atmosphere_0.324 ’ that gripped_0.545 US corporate life_-0.229 in the early 1980s ."
"a1e-fragment01","24","‘ We stirred_0.059 it up , yes , but we never lost_-0.176 any money for anybody and we never added_-0.161 to the unemployment figures . ’"
"a1e-fragment01","25","What he has learned from Goldsmith ( ‘ the only genius I have ever come_-0.485 across_-0.065 ’ ) is that the holding company is not the most important unit of corporate organisation ."
"a1e-fragment01","26","‘ The concept of the company does not interest me - it 's the businesses that are important ."
"a1e-fragment01","27","It does not matter whether or not DRG makes_-0.143 sellotape or Basildon Bond — it 's of no consequence to anybody if somebody else makes them . ’"
"a1e-fragment01","28","And there is always the ultimate unbundler 's defence_0.176 — that he will make_-0.471 money for his backers ."
"a1e-fragment01","29","In a takeover campaign that has already seen_-0.457 vitriolic language , he responds to the charge_-0.031 that he is mounting_0.412 the bid to enrich himself and his friends by saying : ‘ Nobody could take_-0.235 that as a criticism — this is an investor group ."
"a1e-fragment01","30","It would be a criticism if I was doing it to impoverish myself ’ ."
"a1f-fragment06","142","Letter : Policy and politics at the Labour Party Conference"
"a1f-fragment06","143","From MR DAVID SOSKIN"
"a1f-fragment06","144","Sir : I was interested by your juxtaposition of ‘ Poll predicts_-0.083 42-seat majority for Labour ’ with ‘ Tories hold_-0.206 on ’ ( 30 September ) , the latter referring , of course , to the Conservative victory in Wandsworth , the significance of which appears_-0.121 to have been almost totally ignored by the media ."
"a1f-fragment06","145","Electors are always prepared_0.062 to criticise the Government in answer to pollsters ' questions , but when the same individuals arrive at the polling booth they simply can not bring_-0.406 themselves to vote Labour into power_-0.059 ."
"a1f-fragment07","146","Letter : Policy and politics at the Labour Party Conference"
"a1f-fragment07","147","From MS MOLLY MEACHER"
"a1f-fragment07","148","Sir : Despite a significant gap_0.088 in the Labour Party 's education and training proposals , their objective to double the number of 16-18year-olds in full-time education must be welcomed_0.265 ( 28 September ) ."
"a1f-fragment07","149","England 's full-time staying-on_-0.353 rate stands_0.029 at 28 per cent according to the latest statistics available ."
"a1f-fragment07","150","This compares with 79 per cent in the US , 86 per cent in Sweden , 45 per cent in West Germany and 69 per cent in Japan ."
"a1f-fragment07","151","To add_-0.125 the part-time education and training statistics to those figures does not improve our relative position_0.083 ."
"a1f-fragment07","152","Labour hopes_-0.061 to transform the situation_0 by increasing the number of A-levels_-0.062 to five for the brighter_0.212 youngsters and providing grants for four-year training courses_-0.059 ( two years in a Further_-0.125 Education college followed_0.088 by two with an employer ) for the rest ."
"a1f-fragment07","153","These reforms will only achieve_0.143 their objective if accompanied_0.176 by the implementation of the 1944 Education Act provision for compulsory part- or full-time education or training up to the age of 18 ."
"a1f-fragment07","154","This clause has never yet been activated_0.303 ."
"a1f-fragment07","155","The sharply reduced number of 16-18-year-olds will inevitably lead_-0.156 employers to bid up the wages of that age group_0 to entice young people away from education and into unskilled_-0.061 or semi-skilled_0.333 jobs ."
"a1f-fragment07","156","Employers must be required to release_0.094 16-18-year-olds for education and training for at least two days per week ."
"a1f-fragment07","157","Only then_-0.412 will two vitally important and complementary goals_-0.147 be achieved : to improve Britain 's general educational and vocational_0.303 competence , and hence our productive_0 capacity ; and to reduce_-0.152 our gross educational inequalities between the elite who receive a narrow_0.171 education to a very high_-0.353 standard_-0.129 , and the rest ."
"a1f-fragment08","158","Letter : Policy and politics at the Labour Party Conference"
"a1f-fragment08","159","From MR JOHN PERTWEE"
"a1f-fragment08","160","Sir : Labour does not need_-0.242 a commitment to proportional representation in order to scoop_0.486 most of the centre_0.257 ground_0.059 at the next general election ."
"a1f-fragment08","161","All it needs_-0.303 is to promise a high-powered investigation , such as a Royal Commission , into the practicalities of an alternative voting system_-0.088 ( surely justified by the intense public interest now abounding ) ."
"a1f-fragment08","162","Such a promise would be the only hope of a breakthrough for the disenfranchised voters and would have them flocking to the polls for Mr Kinnock ."
"a1f-fragment08","163","His problem will be that Mrs Thatcher might decide to do it first , and then she will garner the votes ."
"a1f-fragment09","164","Letter : Policy and politics at the Labour Party Conference"
"a1f-fragment09","165","From MR DENIS MacSHANE"
"a1f-fragment09","166","Sir : If Labour is to suggest the setting_-0.029 up of a specialist labour court ( 30 September ) , then such a momentous change in the industrial relations system_-0.094 deserves_0.121 more discussion , and needs_-0.324 to be taken_-0.281 out of the hot-house_0.656 of Labour Party conference politics ."
"a1f-fragment09","167","For three reasons such a move_-0.121 should be welcomed_-0.139 ."
"a1f-fragment09","168","First , it would bring_-0.355 Britain into line with the best European practice , notably in Germany where local , regional and federal labour courts handle_-0.156 problems in a fair_-0.229 , dispassionate way_-0.394 based_-0.188 on law , precedent and judicial expertise in the labour field_-0.029 ."
"a1f-fragment09","169","Second , it would ensure that workers enjoyed_0.152 positive rights_-0.219 under law and reduce_-0.242 the emphasis_0.171 of union immunities_0.438 ."
"a1f-fragment09","170","Labour law will always reflect_0.324 the balance_-0.188 of power_-0.125 in society , and a fully_-0.061 fledged_0.529 labour court system_0.027 will not remove_-0.147 class and fundamental employer-employee differences ."
"a1f-fragment09","171","But it should be possible to create and enforce enough common rules to prevent the absurd see-sawing_0.576 of industrial relations legislation we have seen_-0.485 since 1969 ."
"a1f-fragment09","172","Third , a labour division of the High_-0.25 Court would contribute to the process of constitutional_0.294 reform in Britain which surely is to be a key political issue in the 1990s ."
"a1f-fragment09","173","The ‘ trade union question ’ would cease to haunt_0.062 the Labour Party and while that might upset_-0.03 some Conservatives it would be good for the country ."

"a1f-fragment10","176","Sir : On Saturday you published an advertisement for the 10 extra pages of news and features that you , The Independent , will carry_0.171 from 2 October ."
"a1f-fragment10","177","‘ What do independent experts say about our 10 extra pages ? ’ asks_-0.212 the advertisement ."
"a1f-fragment10","178","The supposedly jokey answers are illustrated_0.188 by photographs of people sleeping outside covered by copies of The Independent : they look like some of the hundreds of visitors_-0.03 who come_-0.618 to St Botolph 's Crypt_0.412 Centre_0.265 for homeless_0.176 people_-0.419 every day_-0.441 ."
"a1f-fragment10","179","Given the already appalling and growing rate of homelessness and lack of hostel facilities in London , when more people than ever will not only have to endure the freezing nights of the coming winter on the streets , but perhaps permanent homelessness , it was terrible to see the situation_-0.059 being exploited_0.206 for a joke by your advertisement : ‘ Just the thing_-0.452 now the evenings are drawing_0.062 in ."

"a1f-fragment11","183","From The Rev J. GILMORE"
"a1f-fragment11","184","Sir : The contents_0.176 of Sarah Helm 's article ‘ Immigration checks to be made_-0.5 on trains ’ ( 25 September ) are extremely worrying ."
"a1f-fragment11","185","During the recent European Community elections the representatives of EC governments promoted_-0.242 the ideal of a border-free Europe by 1992 ."
"a1f-fragment11","186","Now , it would appear_0.029 from this article , that this ideal is shattered_0.394 and a two-tiered_0.412 Europe is on the cards_0.088 ."
"a1f-fragment11","187","One for those who travel by aircraft and one for those who travel by train between London and Paris ."
"a1f-fragment11","188","The presence of immigration officials and police on board trains is comparable to the scenes_0.147 of 1930s America where migrant labourers were turned back at state boundaries ."
"a1f-fragment11","189","What criteria would police and immigration officials use in their search for ‘ potential terrorists ’ on a train that they could not use at a static checkpoint or airport ?"
"a1f-fragment11","190","Do terrorists or illegal persons travel exclusively by train ?"
"a1f-fragment11","191","This is a clear_-0.412 example of the extension_0.364 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act where criteria for stopping , questioning and searching are purely subjective to the official involved ."
"a1f-fragment11","192","Will a person 's accent , dress or skin colour indicate the potential terrorist or , for that matter , football hooligan or drug pusher ?"
"a1f-fragment11","193","This is a recipe_0.364 for fear and anxiety ."
"a1f-fragment11","194","It may mean the detention of innocent people and indeed their imprisonment ."

"a1h-fragment05","69","Obituary : Virgil Thomson"
"a1h-fragment05","70","By PETER DICKINSON"
"a1h-fragment05","71","VIRGIL THOMSON was a composer and writer of originality , courage and wit formed_-0.094 by a unique mixture_0.086 of American and French influences ."
"a1h-fragment05","72","Thomson was born in Kansas City in 1896 , studied_0.091 at Harvard , and then mostly lived in Paris until 1940 ."
"a1h-fragment05","73","His Missouri childhood gave_-0.485 him access_-0.242 to Baptist hymns and church music , but at Harvard he was introduced_-0.139 to the writings of Gertrude Stein and the music of Erik Satie ."
"a1h-fragment05","74","These influences laid_0.206 the foundations_0.194 for the blend_0.114 of the naive and the sophisticated which is the hallmark_0.5 of Thomson 's maturity ."
"a1h-fragment05","75","Like many young American composers he studied_-0.057 with Nadia Boulanger , but after 1925 set_-0.125 out to achieve the ‘ discipline of spontaneity ’ which he found_-0.361 in Stein 's writings ."
"a1h-fragment05","76","When he collaborated directly_0.03 with her in opera the result was of historical_0.088 significance ."
"a1h-fragment05","77","First came_-0.303 Four Saints in Three Acts , produced in 1934 , and then The Mother of Us All ( 1947 ) , which demonstrated_0.118 a new kind of plotless_0.294 opera only now reaching_-0.2 a wider_-0.059 currency_0.061 through the stage works of Philip Glass ."
"a1h-fragment05","78","In Four Saints Thomson 's informality was given_-0.344 free_-0.176 reign_0.147 since he first of all improvised the music at the piano then , when it stuck_0.226 , wrote it down to a figured_0.429 bass ."
"a1h-fragment05","79","He said : ‘ I had wondered whether a piece_0.029 so drenched_0.156 in Anglican chant ( running_-0.065 from Gilbert and Sullivan to Morning Prayer and back_-0.333 ) could rise_-0.091 and sail_0.4 . ’"
"a1h-fragment05","80","But the resulting mixture_0.242 of hymns , folksy tunes and recitatives — at times of intoxicating_0.394 banality — was a sensation_0.242 ."
"a1h-fragment05","81","The opera , like Gershwin 's Porgy and Bess the following year , used_-0.294 an all-Black cast_0.097 and the staging and choreography gave_-0.143 it a British connection_0.216 since it was by Frederick Ashton ."
"a1h-fragment05","82","The Mother of Us All shows_0.029 more continuity , but again much depends upon production in what is still a largely non-narrative opera ."
"a1h-fragment05","83","In 1936 , three years before Aaron Copland , Thomson started writing film scores_0.171 which were a model_-0.059 of unobtrusive clarity_-0.062 and pertinence , combining American materials_0.032 to suit_0.286 documentaries such as The Plow that Broke_0.114 the Plains and The River with the musique d'ameublement approach_0.121 of Satie ."
"a1h-fragment05","84","His score_-0.129 for the film Louisiana Story was awarded_-0.091 the Pulitzer Prize in 1948 ."
"a1h-fragment05","85","Another response to a visual stimulus was Thomson 's series of musical portraits_0.235 of people such as Picasso and Aaron Copland ."
"a1h-fragment05","86","The first of these was written in 1928 and they number about_-0.375 150 ."
"a1h-fragment05","87","Just as Thomson transferred_0.2 Stein 's literary abstraction to music , so these portraits_0.147 unusually employ_0.235 the painter_-0.182 's technique_0.188 of drawing_-0.061 the sitter_0.406 from life : an ideal combination of Thomson 's habit_0 of immediate_0.121 response with an actual subject_-0.059 ."
"a1h-fragment05","88","The results are terse_0.515 and sharply etched_0.645 , like the best line_0.059 drawings_0.25 ."
"a1h-fragment05","89","Thomson could control_-0.033 words with the same fastidiousness as notes ."
"a1h-fragment05","90","He always felt_-0.206 that effective musical criticism began_-0.139 by being well written , and he never lost_-0.375 his liveliness ."
"a1h-fragment05","91","One never quite knew what he was going to say next ."

"a1h-fragment05","96","It is also a thing_-0.515 that even the most experienced reviewer can not always offer ."
"a1h-fragment05","97","Thomson 's judgements about music were not always as accurate as his confident expression implied : he invited_-0.143 discussion ."
"a1h-fragment05","98","Above all he restored_0.206 the focus_-0.118 of music criticism onto the music itself ."
"a1h-fragment05","99","He made_-0.273 no secret of his Francophile enthusiasms , in reaction_-0.111 to the earlier domination of American music by Germans , and he was one of the first writers to register_0.265 the importance of jazz ."
"a1h-fragment05","100","He fearlessly attacked_0.188 convention , which caused problems when he pitched_0.353 into established reputations ."
"a1h-fragment05","101","It has become increasingly apparent that Thomson belonged_0.364 to the American experimental tradition ."
"a1h-fragment05","102","He anticipated some of the enthusiasms of John Cage , whom he first met in 1941 ."
"a1h-fragment05","103","A few years later Thomson recognised_0.094 Cage as ‘ the most original composer in America , if not the world … ’ and Cage repaid_-0.129 the compliment by writing the works section_-0.235 of a monograph on Thomson ."

"a1h-fragment06","115","By HUGH MATHESON"
"a1h-fragment06","116","THOMI KELLER is the outstanding_0.25 figure in the history of international rowing ."
"a1h-fragment06","117","He was President of FISA ( Federation Internationale des Societes d'Aviron ) , the world governing body_-0.03 , for 30 years ; and most of this body_-0.114 's attitudes_0.057 and practices_0.147 reflect_0.129 the force_0.029 of his strict , but genial personality ."
"a1h-fragment06","118","Most athletes first encountered him as a voice , bellowing_0.182 in multi-lingual fury at officials who had broken_-0.065 rules or arrangements_0.111 designed_0 to make_-0.152 racing safer or more fair_-0.286 ."
"a1h-fragment06","119","He was elected to succeed Gaston Mullegg as President of FISA when he was 33 and still competing in the Swiss rowing team ."
"a1h-fragment06","120","He did not loosen_-0.032 his links_0.206 with the athletes when projected_0.353 upwards_0.118 into the Presidency ."
"a1h-fragment06","121","Provided their behaviour was sportsmanlike and safe , oarsmen found_-0.545 only encouragement and humour from a President who was always among them ."
"a1h-fragment06","122","Keller 's Zurich upbringing made_-0.182 him into a skiier and sculler , and he raced for the Grasshopper club ."
"a1h-fragment06","123","He competed for the Swiss cross-country and ski-jumping team at the Student Winter Games and later concentrated on single sculls ."
"a1h-fragment06","124","In 1950 , he was Swiss sculls champion and finished third in the European championships before moving to Manila to work for his family 's private multinational company , Eduard Keller Ltd , for four years ."
"a1h-fragment06","125","On his return , Keller was Swiss champion again in 1955 and was bitterly disappointed when the Swiss chose to boycott the 1956 Olympics after the Russian intervention in Hungary ."
"a1h-fragment06","126","FISA was then a relatively unimportant body_-0.242 which organised_0.091 European and other championships and participated_0.2 in the running_0.029 of Olympic regattas ."
"a1h-fragment06","127","As a rich , forceful young man , Keller had been earmarked_0.364 as a likely future president , even before Mullegg was killed in an aircrash in 1958 ."
"a1h-fragment06","128","Rowing was transformed in the breadth_0.265 and depth_0.147 of participation over the 30 years of his term ."
"a1h-fragment06","129","He sat_-0.5 on the appropriate boards_0.059 of the International Olympic Committee and was President of the General Assembly of International Sports Federations for 17 years ."
"a1h-fragment06","130","These positions_0.2 were not held_-0.143 for his own status_-0.097 but to promote the cause_0.088 of rowing where it needed_-0.094 clout ."
"a1h-fragment06","131","He successfully defended_-0.182 rowing as an Olympic sport and in 1976 introduced_0.118 women 's events , which have now expanded_0.059 to six classes ."
"a1h-fragment06","132","His personal preference for sculling over rowing assisted_0.188 the introduction of quadruple sculls to world championship and Olympic competition ."
"a1h-fragment06","133","Keller was made_-0.194 a Steward of Henley Royal Regatta in 1976 , a time when the proliferation of new six-lane_0.4 , still-water courses_0.206 around the world , which had emerged_0.091 under his guidance_0.176 , seemed a threat_0.057 to the regatta founded in 1829 ."
"a1h-fragment06","134","But it was the spirit_0.265 of Henley , with huge crowds enjoying amateur sport , presented_0.235 with administrative finesse , which Keller took_-0.281 as the yardstick_0.5 for the international circuit_0.344 ."
"a1h-fragment06","135","He loved the place and he returned every year to play_-0.25 an often small part_-0.471 as umpire_0.484 of races between undistinguished clubs far_-0.171 below the Olympic standard_0.314 he was obliged to administer ."
"a1h-fragment06","136","He said this summer that as he gradually wound down his involvement in sport , Henley would be the last thing_-0.176 he would give up ."
"a1h-fragment06","137","During his term as President of FISA he gradually reduced_0.219 his role_-0.371 in Eduard Keller Ltd and used the company offices to provide a world headquarters_0.469 for rowing ."
"a1h-fragment06","138","The sport is now obliged_0.355 to find_-0.471 income from the more normal sources_-0.125 of television and sponsorship , to replace_-0.118 his largely unacknowledged private patronage ."
"a1h-fragment06","139","In spite of his gift to the sport , Keller was anxious not to abuse_0.091 his status as President and never went to a rowing event unless invited ."
"a1h-fragment06","140","Because of this , he had never seen the Oxford and Cambridge boat race until this year ."
"a1h-fragment06","141","He was enthralled by the entire proceeding and remarked that only the English could make_-0.485 a contest between two crews which would not rank_0.061 in the World 's top_-0.281 10 into a bigger_0.031 spectacle than the Olympic final ."
"a1h-fragment06","142","The final task he set_-0.469 himself for his Presidency , which was due to end next year , was to weed_0.355 out of the Regatta calendar all the rowing courses_-0.091 which could be made_-0.152 unfair_0.133 by the wind ."
"a1h-fragment06","143","He had recently travelled from Tasmania to Norway in search of the perfect 2,000 metres of flat water ."
"a1h-fragment06","144","It was a blessing that , in response to congratulations on the superb World Championship Regatta at Bled in Yugoslavia three weeks ago , he was able to reply , ‘ Yes … and best of all , the conditions were fair_-0.324 throughout_0.219 ’ ."

"a1j-fragment33","495","By COLIN HUGHES , Political Correspondent"
"a1j-fragment33","496","AN INCOMING_-0.121 Labour government would turn_-0.182 large areas of Whitehall upside down_0.419 — but the party 's policy review barely considers_0.091 the implications of its plans_-0.031 for restructuring government departments ."
"a1j-fragment33","497","Scattered_0.057 through the policy review are proposals to : Drastically alter the status_0 and organisation of the Department of Trade and Industry ; Create two departments — a Department of Consumer Affairs , and a Department for Legal Administration ; Create a Department of Environmental Protection within the existing Department of the Environment ; Set_-0.147 up a plethora of new commissions and executive agencies ; Set_-0.306 up a Women 's Ministry ."
"a1j-fragment33","498","Those are only the most overt changes advocated in the review papers ."
"a1j-fragment33","499","The only department which explicitly escapes_0.303 unscathed is the one which Conservatives would most like to abolish : the Department of Energy ."
"a1j-fragment33","500","In virtually every case the aim_0.057 of causing upheaval is explicitly declared , because Labour 's aim_-0.03 would be to upset_-0.111 the bureaucratic order_-0.3 it inherits_0.182 ."
"a1j-fragment33","501","New departments and quangos would , according to the review , be designed_0.176 to act_-0.188 as irritants_0.033 and antagonists within the Civil Service system_0.161 ."
"a1j-fragment33","502","But the policy review nowhere_0.147 considers_-0.03 the overall effect of the individual changes proposed , or how they might be co-ordinated_0.086 ."
"a1j-fragment33","503","Nor does it contemplate_0.364 the knock-on consequences for Labour ministers of attempting to implement their programme while rebuilding_-0.031 the governmental machine_0.371 ."
"a1j-fragment33","504","The ‘ medium term industrial strategy ’ which would form the centrepiece_0.571 of Labour 's economic policy would , according to the Productive and Competitive Economy review group , be ‘ administered by a transformed Department of Trade and Industry ’ ."
"a1j-fragment33","505","The review adds_0.061 : ‘ What we now seek_-0.059 is a DTI which will have an equal , if not superior status_-0.029 , to that of the Treasury . ’"
"a1j-fragment33","506","That approach_0 would seek_0.029 to knock_0.235 out a keystone_0.559 of Civil Service tradition ."
"a1j-fragment33","507","Labour policy has long sought_0.152 to challenge_0.206 the Treasury 's dominance in government ."
"a1j-fragment33","508","But its last effort — the Department of Economic Affairs , set_-0.344 up by Harold Wilson and headed_-0.062 by George Brown — ended in futile departmental and ministerial infighting ."
"a1j-fragment33","509","There would in addition be a minister for Science and Technology at the newly supreme_0.257 DTI , with responsibility for determing_0 investment in research ."
"a1j-fragment33","510","There is no mention_-0.118 in the education policy of how that might affect the Department of Education and Science ."
"a1j-fragment33","511","But while the DTI would override_0.303 the Treasury , a new ‘ powerful_0.235 Department of Consumer Affairs ’ would antagonise_0.543 the DTI ."
"a1j-fragment33","512","It would be headed_-0.121 by ‘ a minister of Cabinet rank_-0.25 ’ and act_-0.097 as ‘ the consumers ’ voice_0.029 with other government departments ' ."
"a1j-fragment33","513","Its remit for inter-departmental intrusion_0.235 would be wide_0.059 , with ‘ a watching_0.176 brief_0.029 over government action ’ and the ability_-0.091 to initiate consumer legislation ."
"a1j-fragment33","514","Only the Women 's Ministry would be given_-0.194 equal license ."
"a1j-fragment33","515","It would be able_-0.25 to ‘ require_0 each government department to review its policies , practices , and existing and proposed legislation ’ ."
"a1j-fragment33","516","While new departments are born_0.129 and others extended_0.2 , one of the oldest_-0.147 — the Home Office — would become a shadow_0.161 of its present_0.056 self_0.03 ."
"a1j-fragment33","517","Labour 's proposed Department for Legal Administration would take_-0.273 over responsibility for courts and tribunals ; court procedures ; organisation , training and appointment of the legal profession , magistracy and judiciary ; legal aid ; legal services ; and the Sentencing Council ."
"a1j-fragment33","518","That would leave_-0.219 the Home Office with policing , penal policy and the criminal law ."
"a1j-fragment33","519","Responsibility for the Sex Discrimination Act , the Equal Pay Act and the Equal Opportunities Commission would be given_-0.394 to the Women 's Ministry ."
"a1j-fragment33","520","The concept of a minister having Cabinet rank_-0.118 — and therefore implicitly not being a member_0.324 of the Cabinet proper_0.242 — crops up again on environment ."
"a1j-fragment33","521","A ‘ new Minister of Environmental Protection ’ would operate_0.091 inside the DoE ."
"a1j-fragment33","522","That could work_-0.176 — though it is easy to imagine conflicts_-0.029 of interest_-0.303 with the housing and planning functions of the department ."
"a1j-fragment33","523","More problematic will be Labour 's plan_-0.324 for the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food ."
"a1j-fragment33","524","‘ The priority of MAFF must become food , not farming , ’ the policy review says_-0.344 ."
"a1j-fragment33","525","‘ Its main concerns_-0.25 would become food and the people who consume it , not farming and those who produce it . ’"
"a1j-fragment33","526","But the regulatory functions over the food industry , now split_0.029 between MAFF and the Department of Health , would transfer_0.114 to a new Food Standards_0.176 Agency ."
"a1j-fragment33","527","That is the first of many agencies , executives , commissions , and other quango-like bodies_0 recommended_-0.03 by the review ."
"a1j-fragment33","528","In some cases Labour 's quangos merge_-0.029 existing ones , or replace_-0.147 well-established bodies_0.303 ."
"a1j-fragment33","529","The funding of higher_0.147 education would become the responsibility of one body_-0.212 , rather than two ."
"a1j-fragment33","530","Labour 's Quality Commission would replace_-0.176 the Audit Commission ."
"a1j-fragment33","531","But there would be new regulatory commissions and consumer councils for every utility , along with ombudsmen , and public interest_0.229 commissioners appointed by the Secretary of State ."
"a1j-fragment33","532","There would be Skills UK — a locally structured training commission — a Fair_-0.273 Wages Commission , a Health Technology Commission , a Health Quality Commission , an Education Standards_0.133 Council , an Independent Sentencing Council , a Children 's Commissioner , an Environmental Protection Executive , and a Social Insurance Fund administered_-0.029 by … ‘ an independent commission ’ ."

"a1j-fragment34","534","By COLIN HUGHES and COLIN BROWN"
"a1j-fragment34","535","AN IMPASSIONED appeal for Labour to back_0.086 electoral reform was made_-0.303 by a leading_0.062 Shadow_0.152 Cabinet member_-0.088 yesterday after the national executive decided_-0.206 overwhelmingly to oppose_0.114 a proportional representation motion ."
"a1j-fragment34","536","Robin Cook , a member_0.061 of the national executive and the health spokesman , said that a Labour government which sought_0.03 to force_0 its programme on an unwilling nation would be unsocialist ."
"a1j-fragment34","537","He told a Labour Co-ordinating_0.094 Committee rally that it was not enough for Labour to win the next election ."
"a1j-fragment34","538","It would also be necessary ‘ to smash_0.5 the decrepit_0.281 , effete_0.5 constitution_0.235 that allows_-0.121 a minority to capture_-0.133 power_-0.031 , and then use_-0.5 it ruthlessly in the interests_0.171 of the privileged few ’ ."
"a1j-fragment34","539","Mr Cook argued that 10 years of Thatcherism had been forced_0.029 on most people , who had never voted Conservative , and that many of those who opposed PR in the Labour Party wanted to use the same undemocratic power_0.129 ‘ to ram_-0.125 socialism down the throats_0.679 of a majority who did n't vote for it ’ ."
"a1j-fragment34","540","Advocates of the first-past-the-post system_0.091 argued that it was the only way_-0.5 of delivering_0 strong_-0.484 government , Mr Cook said ."
"a1j-fragment34","541","But after 10 years of Tory rule , he had had enough of that approach_-0.057 to politics ."
"a1j-fragment34","542","Labour would be acquiescing_0.457 in a ‘ democratic outrage ’ if it continued arguing_-0.029 that , because the Conservatives had got_-0.6 away with being undemocratic for so long_-0.118 , it was now Labour 's turn_-0.219 ."
"a1j-fragment34","543","Mr Cook also countered the argument that PR would build_-0.031 in a pull_-0.086 towards the centre_0.188 ground_-0.059 , preventing Labour from implementing a radical_0.343 programme ."
"a1j-fragment34","544","It seemed strange to make_-0.529 that argument , Mr Cook said , when it was clear_-0.062 the whole_-0.314 policy review process was designed_-0.242 to placate the centre_0.235 ground_0 ."
"a1j-fragment34","545","‘ I can not honestly see_-0.375 that a system_0 which would require us to compromise the morning after the election is really so morally inferior_0.032 to a system_-0.029 which has already obliged_0.361 us to compromise our policies two years before polling day . ’"
"a1j-fragment34","546","His speech , however , came_-0.303 aftera 24-4 vote in the national executive to oppose a proportional representation motion which will be debated on Thursday ."
"a1j-fragment34","547","The four were Mr Cook , Ken Livingstone , John Evans and Clare Short ."
"a1j-fragment34","548","Mr Livingstone said he was against pacts , but 10 years of Thatcherism had demonstrated_0.206 the dangers of giving_-0.242 power_0.312 to elites ."
"a1j-fragment34","549","However , Neil Kinnock , the Labour leader , and Roy Hattersley , his deputy , both opposed the motion ."
"a1j-fragment34","550","Mr Hattersley said giving_-0.125 disproportionate power_0.062 to small , minority centre_0.265 parties would not improve democracy ."
"a1j-fragment34","551","Mr Kinnock said it was wrong to propose a fundamental change in the voting system_-0.206 for a short-term tactical_0.324 vote to get_-0.206 rid_0.029 of the Thatcher Government ."
"a1j-fragment34","552","The only way_-0.367 to remove_0.032 the Government was for Labour to win the next general election ."
"a1j-fragment34","553","Mr Kinnock intends to reinforce_0.257 his conviction_0.412 that Labour is in a position_-0.1 to win in his keynote speech tomorrow ."
"a1j-fragment34","554","Party organisers want the conference to show_-0.441 that the party is united as never before_-0.057 , leaving_-0.176 Mr Kinnock free_-0.031 for the first time to sell_-0.545 the policy package_0.088 to voters without worrying about splits_0.343 ."
"a1j-fragment34","555","There is expected to be a close_-0.212 vote on defence , but Mr Kinnock is confident the new policy will be affirmed today ."
"a1j-fragment34","556","The executive is recommending_0.029 rejection of a motion calling_-0.161 for unilateral disarmament ."
"a1j-fragment34","557","It is also urging_0.206 the conference to oppose_0.235 a motion , supported_0.03 by the National Union of Mineworkers , to commit_0 a Labour government to abolishing all nuclear power_0 within 15 years ."

"a1l-fragment01","9","They win their parents over with a rose-tinted_0.310 vision of the world which is decidedly reassuring_0.324 ."
"a1l-fragment01","10","Their books are usually set_-0.5 nostalgically in the past — the Thirties and Forties are favourite periods — and often feature the perennial_0.2 characters_0.121 of fairy tales and nursery rhymes ."
"a1l-fragment01","11","Yet they are saved_-0.031 from sentimentality by the wry humour of both text and pictures ."
"a1l-fragment01","12","The Ahlbergs have been accused of not facing up to the harsh_0.156 realities of life , of being too cosy and sweet_-0.125 , but their latest picture book , Bye Bye Baby , published today , breaks_-0.094 the mould_0.371 ."

"a1l-fragment01","17","The way_-0.176 to look_-0.344 at Bye Bye Baby , they insist , is as a ‘ light_-0.094 , surreal comedy ’ ."

"a1l-fragment01","20","The visual inspiration for the book was the famous advert for Start-rite shoes , showing_-0.156 a small boy and girl walking off down a tree-lined_0.156 avenue — an innocent_0.114 image if ever there was one ."
"a1l-fragment01","21","The Ahlberg version features a solitary figure ."
"a1l-fragment01","22","The advert gave_-0.265 the story its vaguely Thirties setting ."
"a1l-fragment01","23","The success of the Ahlbergs ' working relationship must have a lot to do with their long_-0.206 and happy_-0.314 marriage ."
"a1l-fragment01","24","In spite of apparently incompatible personalities — she is small and shy , he is large and does most of the talking — they have an empathy which is essential to the way_-0.156 they work , a persistent mutual pestering ."
"a1l-fragment01","25","The strength_-0.156 of the partnership is highlighted_0.242 for Allan , who also works with a number of other artists ."
"a1l-fragment01","26","The time-consuming nature_0.382 of Janet 's part_-0.485 in the process , combined_0 with a bad back which prevents her spending_-0.121 more than a couple of hours at the drawing board every day , means she can not keep up with her husband 's prolific_0.088 output ."
"a1l-fragment01","27","‘ With other illustrators , I work at a distance — we visit and phone , but there is a point_-0.324 at which I ca n't pester them any more , ’ Allan says ."
"a1l-fragment01","28","They see_-0.441 themselves not as author and illustrator , with separate roles_-0.031 , but as a partnership of ‘ book-makers ’ , contributing equally to the process ."
"a1l-fragment01","29","Allan Ahlberg says : ‘ In the past , a lot_-0.281 of children 's books seemed to be the work of talented illustrators whose pictures looked brilliant_0.545 framed in a gallery , but when you tried to read the book , there was nothing there_-0.455 , because the words started_0.059 as a coat-hanger_0.735 to hang_-0.2 pictures_0 on . ’"
"a1l-fragment01","30","Given the importance they place_-0.188 on the interrelationship of words and pictures , the couple 's working lives are surprisingly separate ."
"a1l-fragment01","31","They claim_0 to see each other less than couples who go out to work , meeting for the occasional cup of coffee in the kitchen ."
"a1l-fragment01","32","Their 10-year-old daughter , Jessica , who is likely to be seen with her head buried_0.182 in The Beano or a Roald Dahl novel , has provided the inspiration for many of her parents ' books ."
"a1l-fragment01","33","As a baby , she was fascinated by the Mothercare Catalogue , and so The Baby 's Catalogue , which documents the paraphernalia of the infant 's small world_-0.353 in minute detail , was born_-0.143 ."

"a1l-fragment01","42","These days , he writes the books intended to help children learn to read ."
"a1l-fragment01","43","‘ A lot_-0.324 of books used in schools are technically readable but rather drab stories ."

"a1l-fragment01","45","Writing books for children is becoming increasingly complex , as the arbiters of the modern child 's mores — librarians , teachers and publishers — lay_-0.029 down ever more stringent criteria ."
"a1l-fragment01","46","‘ The problem with children 's books increasingly is that there are armies_0.188 of people who are properly concerned with , for example , the way_-0.515 girls were always discriminated against in the past , ’ says Allan ."
"a1l-fragment01","47","‘ That is bad , and must be thought about ."
"a1l-fragment01","48","But people seem to think that stories are written to a prescription_0.467 , that you sit down and say , you do n't want it to be sexist , you do n't want it to be racist ."

"a1m-fragment01","2","By CHRISTIAN WOLMAR"
"a1m-fragment01","3","THE information technology revolution_-0.094 has left_-0.314 large swaths of rural Britain untouched_-0.031 ."
"a1m-fragment01","4","The only computers in many villages are those owned by the teenage boys of the affluent to play their wham-bam games ."
"a1m-fragment01","5","Ashley Dobbs , an engaging young entrepreneur , is setting_0 out to change_0.061 that by creating a nationwide network of ‘ telecottages ’ ."
"a1m-fragment01","6","This clever_0.1 name , with its neat_0.057 evocation of new and old , describes_-0.091 a concept which was developed in Sweden and is spreading_0.324 to rural areas across the world ."
"a1m-fragment01","7","In Mr Dobbs 's words , a telecottage is ‘ a room in a village filled with computer communications that can be used by local people to learn and work ’ ."
"a1m-fragment01","8","The equipment consists of , perhaps , four word processors , a modem , a laser printer able to produce artwork-quality output , a fax and a photocopier ."
"a1m-fragment01","9","Software programmes for desk-top publishing , word processing , accounting and business planning are also essential ."
"a1m-fragment01","10","Mr Dobbs , who is chairman of Telecottages UK , warns possible users not to get bogged_0.5 down with the technology : ‘ The equipment is a tool to overcome_0.206 what needs to be done ."
"a1m-fragment01","11","People must n't think that because there 's a computer , they 've got to think of a use for it . ’"
"a1m-fragment01","12","He reckons_0.028 there are no shortages of possible uses — farmers can use it to do their accounts , women with child-care responsibilities can work in their own time on the word processors , publicity material_0.094 for local craftsmen can be produced_0.029 and so on ."
"a1m-fragment01","13","This may sound utopian , but it has been borne out by the experience of existing telecottages ."
"a1m-fragment01","14","So far_-0.455 about_-0.206 100 have been established , mainly in Scandinavia but also in Japan and several third world_-0.061 countries ."
"a1m-fragment01","15","As the network expands_0 , so do the uses ."
"a1m-fragment01","16","The first was opened_-0.188 in the village of Vemdalen in the remote forests of Sweden in September 1985 ."
"a1m-fragment01","17","The impact_0.032 , according to Henning Albrechsten , president of Telecottages International who has been involved in their development since the outset , was immediate_0.194 ."
"a1m-fragment01","18","‘ By holding_-0.171 open_-0.5 meetings for children and having the telecottage above the local store , people of all walks_-0.118 of life came in - small-scale entrepreneurs and their spouses , shop assistants , craftspeople and children ."
"a1m-fragment01","19","Now , 15 per cent of the village regularly_0.125 uses_-0.294 telecottage and at least 20 per cent has taken_-0.312 courses_0.029 there . ’"
"a1m-fragment01","20","Britain is lagging_0.029 behind_-0.161 ."
"a1m-fragment01","21","No telecottages have been established , but there are several initiatives in the offing ."
"a1m-fragment01","22","The most advanced is a plan_0 for five in the north of Scotland which will be funded by the Highlands and Islands Development Board and British Telecom ."
"a1m-fragment01","23","Colin Pavey of British Telecom hopes that they will be running_-0.281 by the end_-0.273 of the year ."
"a1m-fragment01","24","‘ Two would be business-orientated_0.032 and three would be community-orientated and located in schools ."
"a1m-fragment01","25","We are most interested in the idea of networking , sharing_-0.235 skills such as translation and using them for distance learning . ’"
"a1m-fragment01","26","Telephone cables in the region are being upgraded to ensure they are capable_-0.088 of handling_-0.03 faxes ."
"a1m-fragment01","27","Mr Dobbs 's more unlikely allies_0.333 are the Women 's Institutes ."
"a1m-fragment01","28","Most of the workers in telecottages and many of the users are women ."
"a1m-fragment01","29","He says : ‘ In villages there are many women with skills who are n't using them because of child-care problems ."
"a1m-fragment01","30","But they are interested in working ."
"a1m-fragment01","31","Users of telecottages are given the key and people can use them at any time , which means that women can come in during the evening , early in the morning or whatever . ’"
"a1m-fragment01","32","He is working on a scheme with the National Federation of WI to organise a competition to celebrate next year 's 75th anniversary by offering 10 telecottages as prizes for its 9,000 branches_0.353 and he is hoping the WI will establish a pilot telecottage near its college in Denman , Oxfordshire ."
"a1m-fragment01","33","While telecottages should become self-financing once established , they do need initial subsidy ."
"a1m-fragment01","34","The cost of providing the start-up equipment is in the order of £10,000 and Mr Dobbs thinks space is not much of a problem : ‘ There 's usually the village hall or an empty shop . ’"
"a1m-fragment01","35","Henning Albrechsten reckons_0.353 that it takes_-0.29 three years for a telecottage to be able_-0.2 to function without subsidy ."
"a1m-fragment01","36","In Scandinavia , with their mixed_0.031 economies , money is always available , after a bit_-0.088 of persuasion , from both local and central_-0.156 government ."
"a1m-fragment01","37","In Britain , the tight_0.176 financial regime imposed on local councils and the reluctance_0.059 of central_0.152 government to take_-0.455 on any new expenditure makes_-0.429 it necessary to seek funds from the private sector_0.147 ."
"a1m-fragment01","38","The only government support_-0.147 so far_-0.129 has been a recommendation by the Rural Development Commission , part_-0.394 of the Department of the Environment , to establish a pilot scheme ."
"a1m-fragment01","39","Mr Dobbs sighs : ‘ This is a typically British bureaucratic response_-0.182 ."
"a1m-fragment01","40","It 's been proved elsewhere that they work_-0.4 ."
"a1m-fragment01","41","We do n't need pilots_0.147 , we need telecottages . ’"
"a1m-fragment01","42","As for the private sector_0 , while BT may be happy_-0.312 to provide pump_0.121 priming_0.265 for five telecottages in the north of Scotland , it is not about to bankroll_0 a nationwide network ."
"a1m-fragment01","43","Nor , it seems , is anyone else ."
"a1m-fragment01","44","There is more at stake_0.242 here_-0.355 than just bringing boxes of sophisticated_0.212 equipment to remote areas ."
"a1m-fragment01","45","As Mr Dobbs , who runs_-0.206 a country house restoration business_0 from his home in Micheldever , Hampshire , says : ‘ Villages are good places to live and work ."
"a1m-fragment01","46","The village is a fantastic_0.4 institution and they make_-0.344 people happier . ’"
"a1m-fragment01","47","But the villages are dying_0 , becoming suburbs or dormitories_0.5 where few people work but many sleep ."
"a1m-fragment01","48","Employment in agriculture , still the main rural industry , fell_-0.364 from over_-0.5 a million in the mid-Sixties to under_-0.242 100,000 now ."
"a1m-fragment01","49","The aim_-0.031 of telecottages is to create well-paid , flexible_0.147 employment which will provide new jobs and make_-0.382 existing rural industries more competitive ."
"a1m-fragment01","50","The emphasis_0 on high_-0.235 wages is important ."
"a1m-fragment01","51","Villages are expensive to live in and if they are to become vibrant communities again , local people must be able to earn enough to be able to continue living in them ."
"a1m-fragment01","52","There is a wider_-0.061 impact_0.059 , too ."
"a1m-fragment01","53","The abstract talk_0.086 of commuting by rail or road being replaced_-0.029 by information technology finds_-0.176 a concrete_0.333 expression in the idea of telecottages ."
"a1m-fragment01","54","Once people overcome_0.176 their fears about computers and begin to use them in telecottages , they acquire their own equipment ."
"a1m-fragment01","55","Many may eventually be able to work from home rather than commute to an office ."
"a1m-fragment01","56","Henning Albrechsten says : ‘ Modern information technology has given_-0.406 people in remote regions the opportunity to overcome_0.032 their worst handicap_0.258 ; their distance from the centres_0.094 of learning and development . ’"
"a1m-fragment01","57","He sees_-0.176 them as not only strengthening_-0.031 small communities , but also as actually beginning to reverse_0.242 the population flows_-0.061 from the countryside to the towns ."
"a1m-fragment01","58","Britain , with its growing_0.182 traffic problems , seems an ideal place for the onset of this revolution_0.382 ."
"a1m-fragment01","59","Despite Mr Dobbs 's tireless_0.419 efforts , this is another revolution_0 which Britain is likely to be viewing_-0.029 from the sidelines_0.029 ."

"a1n-fragment18","338","Well , I seem to recall_-0.029 a London gallery exhibiting_0.176 a pile of rubbish , which was considered_0.152 valid_0.121 art by the proprietors and drew_-0.324 a large_-0.273 attendance ."
"a1n-fragment18","339","The only redeeming_0.303 feature of a goalless , worthless event at Stamford Bridge was that it did not require a grant ."
"a1n-fragment18","340","Yet the Chelsea manager , Bobby Campbell , and Arsenal assistant , Theo Foley , agreed it had been a good match , and the spectators ' complaints were muted_0.118 ."
"a1n-fragment18","341","Some even applauded the players at the end_-0.353 ."
"a1n-fragment18","342","It takes_-0.452 all sorts ."
"a1n-fragment18","343","Bobby Robson was there to assess_0.118 World Cup candidates , but nothing positive emerged_0.424 from 90 minutes of scuffling_0.294 that made_-0.333 one almost yearn for the more measured boredom of Rangers ' European Cup exit_0.028 in Munich three days earlier ."
"a1n-fragment18","344","At least the outcome was appropriate ."
"a1n-fragment18","345","Had either of the teams won_-0.242 , they would have taken_-0.118 the League leadership_0.25 ."
"a1n-fragment18","346","Instead Liverpool stayed_-0.129 top_-0.219 without kicking a ball ."
"a1n-fragment18","347","Television had postponed_0.4 Manchester United 's scheduled visit_-0.194 to Anfield so it could be shown live_-0.278 on 22 December , the longest_-0.139 night ."
"a1n-fragment18","348","London 's leading_0.206 pair , as if piqued_0.543 by this , turned_-0.235 30 September into the longest_0.029 afternoon ."
"a1n-fragment18","349","On and on it dragged_0.133 ."
"a1n-fragment18","350","Lacking a goal that might have altered its chemistry_0.273 , it remained a matter of dull_0.029 physics_0.188 ."
"a1n-fragment18","351","Yet many of the crowd were kept_-0.182 interested by the possibility of victory , which is , I suppose , what derbies are about ."
"a1n-fragment18","352","They are so frequent these days in London , which has eight of 20 First Division clubs , that we must expect aesthetic considerations to be overridden ."

"a1n-fragment18","364","Michael Thomas , several years younger , is not quite in the same class_0 yet but may have to play in Chorzow ."

"a1p-fragment01","3","THE ARCHBISHOP of Canterbury , Dr Robert Runcie , exchanged_-0.029 a symbolic kiss of peace with Pope John Paul II yesterday at a mass attended by thousands in St Peter 's Square , Rome ."
"a1p-fragment01","4","But Dr Runcie 's ideas of a limited primacy — recognising the Pope as a central_-0.029 figure in the Christian Church , who would exercise_0.212 ‘ a primacy for the sake of unity and mission ’ — have been rejected as insufficient by the Pope ."
"a1p-fragment01","5","They have also aroused_0.265 Protestant anger against Dr Runcie , at the same time as he has become involved in a row over his attack_0.091 on the ‘ Pharisees_0.438 ’ of British society ."
"a1p-fragment01","6","Though Dr Runcie and his party could not take_-0.182 Holy Communion at the papal mass , he had earlier celebrated the eucharist at the Anglican church in Rome after three demonstrators rose from the congregation as he ascended the pulpit ; the visit has been dogged_0.273 by protests from supporters of the Rev Ian Paisley ."
"a1p-fragment01","7","In his sermon , Dr Runcie said : ‘ We should ever recognise the scandal that Anglicans and Roman Catholics must celebrate two eucharists to make_-0.152 one memorial of our redemption on the day of our Lord_0.143 . ’"
"a1p-fragment01","8","Dr Runcie has gone_-0.312 out of his way_-0.303 on this visit to concede many of the doctrinal points_-0.152 and practices which large_-0.152 elements_0.281 of the Church of England have traditionally found_-0.182 offensive in Roman Catholicism ."
"a1p-fragment01","9","The Pope , too , has spoken warmly_0.031 of unity ."
"a1p-fragment01","10","On Saturday the two prelates attended a service_0.029 of vespers at the Church of San Gregorio , which stands_-0.161 on the site where Pope Gregory sent St Augustine of Canterbury off to become the first Archbishop of Canterbury in 597 ."
"a1p-fragment01","11","But in their prepared homilies the Pope and the Archbishop addressed_0.333 quite different problems ."
"a1p-fragment01","12","Dr Runcie repeated his offer of a limited primacy , involving the limited powers_0.171 exercised_0.176 by the popes in the first few centuries of the Christian Church ."
"a1p-fragment01","13","However , the Pope 's account_0.147 of the role_0.032 of the papacy went_-0.412 a great deal farther_0.059 than that : Christian unity , he said , must be founded_-0.176 on the faith in Christ that was handed_0.441 on by the Apostles ; what this faith is must be determined by the Roman Catholic Church ."
"a1p-fragment01","14","He quoted the Second Vatican Council : ‘ The task of giving_-0.029 an authentic interpretation of the Word of God … has been entrusted to the living teachting_0.344 office of the Church alone_0.059 ."
"a1p-fragment01","15","The specific role_-0.294 of bishops which is to be exercised_0.235 in communion_0.412 with the see_-0.156 of Peter in ensuring the unity and continuity of the faith is vital_0.029 if we are to hand_-0.03 on the faith of Peter , Gregory and Augustine ."
"a1p-fragment01","16","All our efforts to restore_-0.2 unity among Christians will be in vain if they are not carried out in total fidelity to the faith in Christ … handed_0.129 on by the Apostles . ’"
"a1p-fragment01","17","In a statement afterwards Dr Runcie stressed_0.091 that he was not proposing any change_-0.294 in the British constitution_0.235 ."
"a1p-fragment01","18","‘ The phrase ‘ universal primacy ’ has a spiritual meaning ."
"a1p-fragment01","19","It does not imply political supremacy , and does not suggest that the Pope should administer the affairs of the Church of England , ’ he said ."
"a1p-fragment01","20","Both prelates referred to the consecration in February of the Rt Rev Barbara Harris as the Anglican Assistant Bishop of Massachussetts ."
"a1p-fragment01","21","Bishop Harris is quite unacceptable to the Vatican ."
"a1p-fragment01","22","The Pope said : ‘ Events in recent years have seriously aggravated_0.303 the differences between us . ’"
"a1p-fragment01","23","The Independent has learnt_0 that 1,800 American Roman Catholic nuns wrote last winter to Dr Runcie , urging him to defy the Pope over the ordination of women ."

"a1p-fragment03","59","JOHN SMITH , the shadow_0.4 Chancellor , yesterday set_-0.188 the overriding tone_0 for this week 's Labour Party conference with a warning that he would impose tough_-0.424 spending controls_0.059 if Labour won_-0.265 the next election ."
"a1p-fragment03","60","His warning casts_0.333 doubt on Labour 's commitment to increase spending on ‘ priority ’ programmes for the health service and pensions ."

"a1p-fragment03","62","He conceded that there would be disputes with colleagues , but said : ‘ There are no quick_-0.061 fixes_-0.029 , and I will not be indulging in any quick_-0.094 fix_-0.182 ."

"a1p-fragment03","64","There are realities that I can not change_-0.233 ."
"a1p-fragment03","65","There will be the reality of the economic situation_-0.086 which we inherit_0.206 , which will not be our fault , but it will be our responsibility ."
"a1p-fragment03","66","When we 've got_-0.303 an economic mess_0.091 , the first duty of a government is to clear_-0.143 up the economic mess_-0.059 ."
"a1p-fragment03","67","‘ Now if that means_-0.147 we have to postpone some of our social ambitions , then we may have to do so ."
"a1p-fragment03","68","But it will not mean_-0.086 that we are abandoning_0.212 them ."
"a1p-fragment03","69","We will tackle_0.545 putting_-0.147 our economy in order_-0.344 so that we can achieve that social ambition , so that the strong_-0.212 economy is used to finance and develop the fair_-0.1 society . ’"
"a1p-fragment03","70","As for his colleagues , Mr Smith said : ‘ We 're all agreed that we can not spend what we have not earned and we intend to earn it before we spend it ."
"a1p-fragment03","71","That will be the guiding_0.294 light_0.371 of the next Labour government ."
"a1p-fragment03","72","When I insist on that priority , as I can tell you I most certainly will — with the full_-0.265 support_-0.406 of the Prime Minister in doing so — then I 'm sure my colleagues will see_-0.515 the point_0 of that ."
"a1p-fragment03","73","‘ Now it is quite right of them , of course , to allow our social obligations not to be forgotten ; there 'll probably be an argument ."

"a1p-fragment03","76","Mr Smith 's warning coincided with a call by Ken Livingstone , the Labour MP for Brent East , who said on London Weekend Television 's The Walden Interview : ‘ You can be miles_0.125 ahead_-0.125 in the polls , but when you get_-0.559 to the last three weeks , people think , ‘ Can I afford_0.088 a Labour government ? ’"

"a1p-fragment03","80","The policy review 's top_-0.258 rate of income tax - 50 per cent — was too low_-0.2 , he said ."

"a36-fragment07","180","By MARTIN PACEY"
"a36-fragment07","181","IT WAS unfair of Auden to suggest_-0.121 , in his ‘ Letter to Lord Byron ’ , that a poet 's ‘ sense_0.156 of other people 's very hazy_0.457 ’ ."
"a36-fragment07","182","But the vaporous_0.333 presences_0.219 that float_0.312 through this slender_-0.034 and anaemic_0.618 first novel by a notable poet would appear to support_0.057 the claim ."
"a36-fragment07","183","The book — which opens_-0.206 a projected_0.156 sequence of novels that will cover_-0.057 the period from 1968 to the present_-0.03 day — aims_-0.091 to explore_-0.088 what the blurb describes_-0.059 as ‘ the painful_-0.029 transition from youth to adulthood ’ ."
"a36-fragment07","184","This , of course , is a popular subject_0.094 : it seems particularly attractive_-0.294 to the poet-turned-novelist because of the scope it offers for the tremulously_0.343 sensitive_0.219 probing_0.143 of feelings ."
"a36-fragment07","185","Sensitivity_0.156 , though , is not enough ."
"a36-fragment07","186","What Andrew Motion presents_0.484 us with here_-0.364 is a static and humourless_0.161 mood-piece_-0.118 filled_-0.029 with over-elaborate_0.118 imagery_0.229 ."
"a36-fragment07","187","The hero , Francis Mayne , is suffering from the adolescent 's emotional confusion and acute self-consciousness ."
"a36-fragment07","188","He finds_-0.324 it hard_-0.059 to communicate with people , not least his separated parents ."
"a36-fragment07","189","His father is a faceless figure : a retired brigadier , reserved_0.094 and taciturn ."
"a36-fragment07","190","His mother , by contrast_-0.061 , is the most vividly_0.594 realised character in the book : nervy , flirtatious and selfish , already on her third husband , she thinks primarily of her appearance , even when visiting her dying daughter , Francis 's twin ."
"a36-fragment07","191","The first half of the novel is dominated_0.176 by the girl 's death from leukaemia ."
"a36-fragment07","192","There is a refreshing_0.229 simplicity and tenderness_0.353 in Motion 's account_0.156 of the way_-0.235 Francis nurses her , but she herself is too sketchily drawn_0.424 for the episode to carry_-0.029 much weight_0 ."
"a36-fragment07","193","Meanwhile , at his public school , Francis is conducting_0.029 a love-affair with an older pupil named Keith Ogilvie ."
"a36-fragment07","194","He is finally rejected by the devious_0.161 , arrogant Keith , who informs him that he is ‘ obsolete_0.176 ’ because he does not ‘ know how to make_-0.394 things_-0.265 happen ’ ."
"a36-fragment07","195","His response_-0.118 to this rejection is as flat_-0.094 as his reaction_0.118 to the massive_-0.182 demonstration which Keith has earlier persuaded him to join_-0.265 against the Vietnam War ."
"a36-fragment07","196","This violent_0.091 event , described at length in hysterically_0.25 colourful_0 terms , is the only piece_-0.114 of history to be woven_0.406 convincingly into the plot_0.242 ."
"a36-fragment07","197","Other broad_0.143 hints as to the date are inserted_0.182 with a comical lack of subtlety : ‘ My God , darling , have you heard ? ’ exclaims Francis 's mother one day as she greets him , ‘ Czechoslovakia ."

"a36-fragment07","199","Motion will have to do better than this if he seriously intends his series of novels to capture_0 the feel_-0.2 of a period ."
"a36-fragment07","200","But the book 's principal defect remains the vacuity of its protagonist ."
"a36-fragment07","201","In his eagerness to depict the cloudy_0.412 psychology of an adolescent , Motion has forgotten to give_-0.324 the boy a personality ."
"a36-fragment07","202","He has , however , given_-0.375 him a psychotic compulsion to formulate fanciful similes ."
"a36-fragment07","203","Hardly a page goes_-0.333 by without the hapless Francis noticing something which reminds him , improbably , of something else ."
"a36-fragment07","204","Sometimes he is reminded of several things_-0.471 ."
"a36-fragment07","205","One moment an avenue of chestnut trees looks ‘ like a child_-0.182 's drawing_-0.032 of ghosts_0.059 ’ ; the next it appears ‘ frightening but derelict , like extinguished_0.4 chandeliers_0.588 ’ ; and finally the chestnuts ‘ prance_0.429 at him , holding_0.156 up their gleaming branches like hysterics_0.625 . ’"

"a38-fragment01","2","By JAMES RUPPERT"
"a38-fragment01","3","FROM this month , all new cars submitted for British type approval , the test which allows_-0.2 them to be legally sold in the UK , must be able_-0.265 to run_-0.344 on lead-free petrol ."
"a38-fragment01","4","As a result of this rule_-0.182 , and many carefully orchestrated_0.312 publicity campaigns_0 , the motor industry 's image_-0.091 has now changed from polluter to pal_0.364 of the earth ."
"a38-fragment01","5","If you can afford an environmentally friendly G-registered runabout , then the flora , fauna and children of the British Isles will have a lot to thank you for ."
"a38-fragment01","6","But if you have a tight_-0.125 budget and a conscience , running older cars on lead-free fuel becomes a much more complicated_0.294 issue ."
"a38-fragment01","7","Without the presence of a lead compound , an engine 's valve seats_0.125 go unprotected_0.161 ."
"a38-fragment01","8","This leads_-0.061 to premature wear and plumes_0.286 of blue smoke spewing_0.455 from the exhaust ."
"a38-fragment01","9","The only effective remedy_0.294 is to install hardened valve seats_-0.091 or a replacement cylinder head_-0.147 , both expensive options ."
"a38-fragment01","10","Less costly , but not entirely satisfactory , is the practice of making_-0.25 every fourth tankful leaded petrol , which protects the valve seats_-0.029 but rather defeats_-0.133 the object_0.152 ."
"a38-fragment01","11","Alternatively there are several chemical additives on the market_0.118 which aim_-0.188 to provide a substitute for lead , although the case for these products has yet to be proved ."
"a38-fragment01","12","However , many cars built within the last few years have hardened valve seats_0 , or alloy cylinder heads_0.091 that need_-0.257 little ( simply a retune_0.182 ) or no modification to use unleaded petrol ."
"a38-fragment01","13","Finding out which cars can and which can not is not difficult ."
"a38-fragment01","14","Esso filling stations have a free_-0.467 booklet listing_0.152 most models produced since 1980 , as does the charity Clear ( 01-387 4970 ) , with more detail available in the Unleaded Petrol Guide ( Autodale , £2.99 ) ."
"a38-fragment01","15","Looking at those lists provides interesting reading and bears out the used-car trade 's view_-0.273 that having a lead-only car could prove to be a liability ."
"a38-fragment01","16","It is not as if four-star leaded fuel is going to be phased out tomorrow , but more and more buyers are asking : ‘ Does it take_-0.281 unleaded ? ’"
"a38-fragment01","17","What is certain is that the pre-1989 Austin/MG range_0.212 , all Skodas , Yugos and quite a few Lancias do not , which does not help_-0.438 already depressed_0.324 resale prices ."
"a38-fragment01","18","A 1985 Lancia Y10 ( lead only ) sells for around_-0.147 £2,000 whereas the similar Fiat Uno 55 from the same year , converted_0.455 to run_-0.486 on unleaded , is worth around_-0.147 £500 more ."
"a38-fragment01","19","A lead-only second-hand car is now worth about_-0.273 10 per cent less than an unleaded equivalent ."
"a38-fragment01","20","In years to come_-0.147 the percentage difference is likely to be much larger_-0.161 ."
"a38-fragment01","21","Even so , exotica such as lead-only Porsche 911s and Ferraris are unlikely to be part_-0.429 of this trend , so no bargains there_-0.364 I 'm afraid ."
"a38-fragment01","22","More impressive are the Japanese manufacturers whose cars dating from the early Eighties can run_-0.333 on unleaded without adjustment ."
"a38-fragment01","23","Find a 1980 Toyota Corolla or 1982 Nissan Sunny that has not succumbed_0.606 to rust , and you can buy with confidence ."
"a38-fragment01","24","On the home front_-0.121 , most Fords and Vauxhalls from at least the mid-Eighties can use unleaded ."
"a38-fragment01","25","If the ‘ greenness_0.486 ’ of going unleaded still seems a bit_0.152 of a grey_0.333 area_0.118 , it is possible to switch to diesel without a shadow_0.344 of environmental doubt ."
"a38-fragment01","26","Diesel always has been lead-free and the only adjustments_0.182 you need to make_-0.273 are mental ones_-0.147 , because diesel-powered cars are no longer slow , smelly or noisy ."
"a38-fragment01","27","They also return_-0.121 more miles to the gallon than their petrol equivalents , although service intervals_0.188 are shorter_-0.065 ."
"a38-fragment01","28","But after the publicity on unleaded fuel there has been increased interest in used diesel power ."
"a38-fragment01","29","But remember that these cars accrue , and can withstand , significantly higher_-0.206 mileages than petrol cars , 50-90,000 being the norm ."
"a38-fragment01","30","The tradition for diesel cars is far_-0.2 better established on the Continent and that is where the best buys come_-0.529 from ."
"a38-fragment01","31","Perhaps the most successful_-0.152 maker is Peugeot , with a complete range_0.083 of cars from the small 205 — around_-0.161 £3,000 for a 90,000-mile 1985 car — to the legendary 504 estate , about_-0.344 £2,000 for a 1982 example ."
"a38-fragment01","32","The Germans are also fairly accomplished manufacturers , although a five-door 1980 Golf with a six-figure mileage will still cost £1,500 ."
"a38-fragment01","33","Prestige comes_-0.333 in the shape_-0.294 of a Mercedes with the 240D or ‘ Stuttgart Taxi ’ , commanding_0.676 £7,000 but returning_0.029 unfailing reliability ."
"a38-fragment01","34","Even if lead levels_0.032 in the atmosphere do not bother you , I am sure you will find_-0.29 the fact that unleaded petrol is 15p cheaper , and that diesel fuel boosts_0.118 mpg by at least a third , most interesting ."

"a3e-fragment03","24","By ANNA PAVORD"
"a3e-fragment03","25","PLANTS should come_-0.412 a long_-0.265 way_-0.2 down the list_-0.394 of priorities for the novice_0.371 gardener ."
"a3e-fragment03","26","There are many things_-0.156 to think about before_-0.062 even the first tentative daffodil bulb is sunk_0.226 into the ground ."
"a3e-fragment03","27","The first and most important question to mull over as you gaze at your patch is : What is this garden for ?"
"a3e-fragment03","28","If you start writing down some of the responses to that question , you will find_-0.235 you have along the way_-0.303 acquired a ragbag_0.441 of elements_0.312 that will have an important bearing_0.176 on the design ."
"a3e-fragment03","29","If there are small children in the equation_0.382 , there will need to be a flat , soft area where they can fall off swings and climbing frames ."
"a3e-fragment03","30","If you like hanging out washing rather than drying it in the bowels_0.2 of an expensive machine , you will need to tuck away a line and make a dry path to get to and from it ."
"a3e-fragment03","31","Some novice_0.206 gardeners may not want to do much actual gardening at all , but conversely , do not want to look out every day over a scene of threadbare_0.5 grass and rotting fence ."
"a3e-fragment03","32","Their ideal garden will look good and demand_-0.182 little attention ."
"a3e-fragment03","33","If you are a dedicated sun-worshipper , you need to mark_0.062 out the part of the garden where the sun lingers_0.032 longest ."
"a3e-fragment03","34","It may not be the part nearest the house , though this is where sitting out areas always tend to be made ."
"a3e-fragment03","35","You may , even as a novice_0.324 , care so passionately about plants that all you want is the maximum space to grow them in ."
"a3e-fragment03","36","Raised beds_-0.188 built down an unpromising alley could provide extra gardening space ."
"a3e-fragment03","37","Privacy is an important consideration ."
"a3e-fragment03","38","A first time garden is usually small and certainly the typical one I am imagining for this series is no more than 40ft x 20ft and surrounded on all sides by other houses ."
"a3e-fragment03","39","Privacy is a ticklish_0.344 business where close_0.061 neighbours are concerned ."
"a3e-fragment03","40","To throw up an impenetrable Berlin Wall_0 between you and them could be tactless ."

"a3e-fragment03","43","So they should , and when the list of necessities is securely written down , you can ask the second question : How do I want this garden to feel_-0.121 ?"
"a3e-fragment03","44","This question produces_-0.118 as varied a response as the first ."
"a3e-fragment03","45","Some urban gardeners , as short_-0.061 of space inside as they are out , want their gardens to be extensions of their homes , with a great_-0.147 deal_-0.182 of hard paving , good furniture and lighting ."
"a3e-fragment03","46","The garden for them should feel_-0.294 like an extra sitting room , gnat-ridden perhaps , damp occasionally , but an important overflow_0.235 of living space ."
"a3e-fragment03","47","Closet countrysiders may want to pretend their patch is actually a corner of some Sussex meadow and picture_-0.118 it swagged_0.529 with honeysuckle and waving_0.484 with ox-eye_0.618 daisies and scabious ."
"a3e-fragment03","48","This is a difficult trick to bring off with suburban trains hurtling by on one side and lorries grinding_0.265 through their gears on the other ."
"a3e-fragment03","49","A leafy retreat_0.345 is an excellent goal_-0.086 for a small town garden , but it is best made acknowledging the urban setting , using un-wild plants such as bamboo , acanthus , fig , vine , alchemilla , euphorbia , wisteria ."
"a3e-fragment03","50","While you are working through this process , take_-0.303 note_-0.333 of the features in the garden that you would like to keep ."
"a3e-fragment03","51","On a new estate , there may be nothing ."
"a3e-fragment03","52","In an old_-0.235 garden , there may be a fruit tree , or a good bulwark of evergreen laurel or box that , tidied up , could add_-0.242 a dash of venerability_0.618 to the new garden that will emerge_0.294 around it ."
"a3e-fragment03","53","If you do not know what a tree or shrub is , exercise_0.212 clemency and give_-0.212 it a year 's grace to demonstrate its worth_-0.118 before you turn_-0.294 it over to the axeman ."
"a3e-fragment03","54","The mood_0.235 of the garden will dictate_0.059 its eventual style ."
"a3e-fragment03","55","It may be clipped classical , random cottage , modern high-tech , or some intensely personal vision_0 of Byzantium , that no one has ever imagined before_-0.029 , but which exists in your head and wants_-0.143 to get_-0.371 out ."
"a3e-fragment03","56","Do not let anybody , particularly gardening writers , tread_0.143 on your dreams_-0.235 ."
"a3e-fragment03","57","All this thinking and doodling will have done nothing physically to change the view outside the window , but it is a vital_0.355 part_-0.355 of the gardening process ."

"a3k-fragment11","112","IN THE small Devon town of South Molton , Julie Widlake is waiting with anticipation for Friday 20 October ."
"a3k-fragment11","113","She and her boyfriend have had their future planned_-0.029 for some time : they want to start farming in a nearby village , where they also intend to build a bungalow ."
"a3k-fragment11","114","First , they have to sell their present house , a two-bedroom cottage in the centre of the town ."
"a3k-fragment11","115","As is the case almost everywhere else , the market_0.171 in Devon is depressed_0.212 and selling has not been easy ."
"a3k-fragment11","116","So instead of waiting indefinitely for a buyer , they have decided to try selling their house by auction ."
"a3k-fragment11","117","It comes_-0.206 under the hammer_0.382 at 2.15pm on the 20th , at the Barnstaple Motel ."
"a3k-fragment11","118","‘ We accept that we might not get very much for it , but on the other hand_-0.182 we could get more , ’ says Julie Widlake ."
"a3k-fragment11","119","‘ We 've been waiting to move for a long_-0.314 time , and we need the money to build the new house . ’"
"a3k-fragment11","120","Their South Molton cottage ( guide_-0.03 price £44,000-£46,000 ) is one of more than 20 lots to be put_-0.324 up for sale at the Barnstaple auction by Bristol and West Property Services , and one of more than a hundred which the building society subsidiary will be auctioning in eight West Country venues over a three-day period ."
"a3k-fragment11","121","Bristol and West claims_0.133 these auctions will help_-0.375 to bring_-0.059 some action_0.161 to an otherwise slow_0.062 market_0.057 , and says_-0.457 it was overwhelmed_0.29 by the response_0.176 from people wanting to sell in this way_-0.394 ."
"a3k-fragment11","122","Auctions certainly speed up the house-buying process ."
"a3k-fragment11","123","Once the hammer_0.176 has fallen_0.032 , the successful bidder for a house must exchange contracts immediately and pay a deposit ."
"a3k-fragment11","124","Completion normally takes_-0.559 place_-0.242 four to eight weeks later and there is no opportunity for second thoughts ."
"a3k-fragment11","125","As the Bristol and West explains_-0.03 , if a bidder does not sign the contract , the auctioneer can sign on their behalf ."
"a3k-fragment11","126","‘ From the vendor 's point_-0.147 of view_-0.312 , the house is actually sold once a successful bid is made_-0.441 , ’ says Graham Harrison , director of Bristol and West Property Services ."
"a3k-fragment11","127","‘ Many people have suffered from sales falling through and from house-buying chains_0.281 , and some of our vendors feel_-0.419 that now 's as good a time as any to sell . ’"
"a3k-fragment11","128","From the purchasers ' point_-0.1 of view_-0.343 , auctions can also be attractive_-0.086 — if slightly nerve-racking as you wait for bidding to start for the house of your dreams_0 ."
"a3k-fragment11","129","The problem is that normally potential purchasers have to incur the expense of undertaking surveys_-0.147 and arranging_0.219 mortgage finance , without any idea whether they will be able to afford the final selling price ."
"a3k-fragment11","130","Not surprisingly , several estate agents report difficulties at the moment in attracting_-0.029 enough serious bidders ."
"a3k-fragment11","131","‘ With an auction , you 've got to be certain that at least two buyers are there who can commit_-0.065 themselves , and the difficulty is that buyers who can proceed_0.03 are few and far_-0.125 between_-0.219 , ’ said David Phillip , a director of Yorkshire estate agents Dacre Son and Hartley ."
"a3k-fragment11","132","Bristol and West hopes_-0.273 that by arranging_-0.147 collective auctions it will be able_-0.424 to overcome this problem ."
"a3k-fragment11","133","It is also guaranteeing mortgages at 1 per cent below the normal interest rate , for endowment or pension-linked_0.344 policies , on several of the houses up for sale , an interesting and innovative service for would-be bidders ( mortgage surveys_0.171 will already have been undertaken for these houses ) ."
"a3k-fragment11","134","The building society will be staffing_0.206 a mortgage desk at each auction , and says_-0.394 buyers could arrange_0.152 finance there_0.059 and then_-0.441 , subject of course to proof of income and status ."
"a3k-fragment11","135","Obviously , however , Bristol and West hopes_-0.333 to hear from interested people in advance_0.061 — if only so it can gauge_0.457 the likely demand for each property before the auction starts ."
"a3k-fragment11","136","‘ We 're trying to smooth_0.061 the path_0.03 for purchasers , and streamline_0.471 the system_-0.235 , ’ says Graham Harrison , pointing_-0.143 out that live_-0.114 telephone bidding will also be available for those unable to attend ."
"a3k-fragment11","137","Holiday homes and commercial property have been included_0.061 among the lots to be auctioned ."
"a3k-fragment11","138","Although collective property auctions take_-0.406 place_-0.057 regularly in London ( often primarily for investors rather than house-hunters_0.515 ) , in country areas the more typical auction will be just for one house , and as likely as not will take_-0.382 place_-0.118 in a nearby pub or village hall ."
"a3k-fragment11","139","In fact , country auctions are often the nearest_-0.088 many villages get_-0.152 to live_-0.265 theatre_-0.031 ."
"a3k-fragment11","140","‘ The locals come for the entertainment , and to see who 's buying into their village , ’ observed one auction-goer ."
"a3k-fragment11","141","Pub landlords are usually only too happy to provide free_0.091 accommodation ."
"a3k-fragment11","142","‘ It 's very exciting and gets_-0.406 the adrenalin going_-0.375 , ’ says David Phillip , whose firm usually undertakes_0.182 auctions in the Otley area ."
"a3k-fragment11","143","Only certain types of property normally come_-0.182 to auction , however ."
"a3k-fragment11","144","Traditionally , country cottages and houses which have unusual or unique features_0.235 or are in need of a lot_-0.429 of renovation may be auctioned , if only because valuation is likely to be difficult ."
"a3k-fragment11","145","Sometimes , too , houses have to be sold by auction to satisfy the legal requirements of trustees or executors ( auctions provide adequate proof that the property has been sold at the going market_0.121 value , and protect_0.121 trustees from future claims of negligence ) ."
"a3k-fragment11","146","Less happily , but for the same reason , repossessed houses are often auctioned ."
"a3k-fragment11","147","Anyone considering selling by auction needs to be aware that the costs involved will be higher_-0.333 ."
"a3k-fragment11","148","Advertising costs and any expenses incurred in hiring premises are normally passed_0.097 on by the estate agents to the vendor , whether or not the auction results in a sale ."
"a3k-fragment11","149","In addition , agents may charge_-0.125 slightly more commission than usual for a successful_0.114 sale ."
"a3k-fragment11","150","In Bristol and West 's forthcoming auctions , a set fee of £375 plus VAT will be charged_0.088 to everyone entering_0.147 property to sell , with its usual agent 's commission_0.281 ( about_-0.394 2 per cent plus VAT ) charged_-0.094 on top_-0.235 when sales are made_-0.294 ."
"a3k-fragment11","151","‘ We accept that we could lose_-0.29 the money we 've paid to go_-0.364 to auction , but that 's a risk we 're prepared_0.194 to take_-0.324 , ’ says Julie Widlake ."
"a3k-fragment11","152","The secret of a successful outcome depends partly on setting_0.156 the right reserve price , a task the auctioneer undertakes in conjunction with the seller ."
"a3k-fragment11","153","Normally , the reserve is set_-0.5 only days or hours before the auction , when the agents will already have a good indication of how much interest has been shown_0 ."
"a3k-fragment11","154","Too high_-0.091 a reserve price can mean no sale , and disappointment all round ."
"a3k-fragment11","155","‘ You need to understand what your clients ’ expectations are beforehand , ’ says Graham Harrison of Bristol and West ."
"a3k-fragment11","156","Agents and their clients may also have the dilemma of deciding whether to accept any offers made_-0.5 prior to the auction ."
"a3k-fragment11","157","Inevitably they do not always get_-0.657 it right ."
"a3k-fragment11","158","Peter Crowther , managing director of a Leeds business centre_0 , recently bought two semi-detached stone cottages in Bramhope , on the outskirts of Leeds , at an auction in the village pub ."
"a3k-fragment11","159","His successful bid was for £190,000 although he had made_-0.412 a higher_-0.065 prior offer which had been turned_-0.176 down ."
"a3k-fragment11","160","On the other hand_0.059 , sometimes the drama_0.061 of the auction and the competition between bidders can have the opposite_0.065 effect ."
"a3k-fragment11","161","Another recent auction in Leeds saw_-0.156 a run-down stone farmhouse without water or other amenities finally fall_-0.212 under the hammer_0.382 for £330,500 ."
"a3k-fragment11","162","‘ Success is by no means guaranteed at auction , ’ says Graham Harrison ."
"a3k-fragment11","163","‘ In a tough_-0.065 market_-0.029 you need to get_-0.531 the programme right , the price right and have a little bit_-0.235 of luck . ’"

"a3m-fragment02","47","MODERN trams , as most continental Europeans know , neither shake nor rattle , nor do they roll ."
"a3m-fragment02","48","Sleek_0.097 , solidly built , gentle_0.206 on the environment , they are often an ideal form_-0.235 of city transport ."
"a3m-fragment02","49","They also exert_-0.143 a fascination very much of their own as they slither_0.514 round circuses and brush_0.25 through old city gates , flashing arcs of lightning as they switch tracks on winter nights ."
"a3m-fragment02","50","Single-car , articulated or double-decker , trams are one of the most reliable and enduring forms_0 of public transport invented ."
"a3m-fragment02","51","The orange-liveried_0.441 ‘ 1500 ’ series trams in Milan , for example , date from 1927 ."
"a3m-fragment02","52","Eventually they will be replaced , but more than 60 years on they run_-0.382 with the rhythmic_0.188 reliability of a Swiss watch ."
"a3m-fragment02","53","They are as much a part of Milan as La Scala or the Galleria Vittore Emmanuele ."
"a3m-fragment02","54","Last month it was announced that Britain will get_-0.441 its first new-wave_0.062 trams in 1991 ."
"a3m-fragment02","55","Destined_0.229 to run_-0.094 in Manchester , they will relieve_0 traffic congestion_0.094 and help_-0.147 to reduce_0 the levels_-0.114 of carbon monoxide in the city centre , outlying suburbs and satellite_0.389 towns of Bury , Altrincham , Salford , Oldham and Rochdale ."
"a3m-fragment02","56","In Britain , with the main exception of Blackpool ( not forgetting the single-deckers of the Isle of Man and Llandudno ) , trams had been largely relegated to the history books ."
"a3m-fragment02","57","Otherwise , the best place to see working_-0.394 trams has been the tram museum at Crich in Derbyshire or else in old British Transport Commission films and Ealing comedies ."
"a3m-fragment02","58","Trams disappeared from most British cities in the 1950s ."
"a3m-fragment02","59","London 's venerable_0.438 red and cream double-deckers rumbled along the Thames embankment for the last time in 1952 ."
"a3m-fragment02","60","Somehow the image_-0.091 of the tall , thin , mournful_0.281 double-deck tram with its wooden body_0.2 , slatted wooden seats and growling_0.545 electric motor has stuck_0.118 in the British mind_-0.156 ."
"a3m-fragment02","61","Trams , it was believed until surprisingly recently , are old-fashioned ."
"a3m-fragment02","62","They had something to do with fish and chips wrapped in newspaper , men in hats , National Health specs , smog and powdered egg ."
"a3m-fragment02","63","They held_-0.118 up the bright_0.424 new diesel buses and , even worse , blocked_-0.088 the progress of private motorists in bulbous_0.514 Austins and lumpen_0.324 Humbers in canyon-like_-0.019 city thoroughfares ."
"a3m-fragment02","64","They picked_-0.065 up power from a spider_0.455 's web_0.375 of unsightly overhead wires ."
"a3m-fragment02","65","They were inflexible_0.235 in operation_0.118 , draughty , and mobile reminders of TB epidemics with the enamelled ‘ Do Not Spit ’ signs screwed to their bulkheads ."
"a3m-fragment02","66","But the modern tram could hardly be more different ."
"a3m-fragment02","67","It plays_-0.125 a key role_-0.03 in keeping_-0.029 city streets on the move and is even the object of the best modern designers ' desire ."
"a3m-fragment02","68","In Milan , for example , the commission to design the new generation_0.057 of ‘ Jumbo ’ trams , which went_-0.485 into service in 1979 , was one that leading_-0.118 Italian architects and designers fought_-0.088 over ."
"a3m-fragment02","69","After all , the Jumbo , a handsome_0.219 and imposing articulated unit designed by architect , engineer and critic Klaus Giovanni Koenig , will be seen on the streets of Milan for the next half-century_-0.029 ."
"a3m-fragment02","70","Spotlessly clean and popular , the Jumbo is a long-term advertisement for Koenig 's design skills ."
"a3m-fragment02","71","The modern tram is a green machine ."
"a3m-fragment02","72","Assuming_0.091 the power station at the end of the line burns_0.286 cleanly , the tram is virtually pollution free_-0.206 ."
"a3m-fragment02","73","Standing_0.062 at traffic lights a Koenig-designed Jumbo is , save for the chatter inside , completely silent ."

"a3m-fragment02","75","Powers of acceleration and braking are remarkable , the latter far_-0.167 greater_0.062 than any car ."
"a3m-fragment02","76","But sadly , there is no indication that the GMA consortium which will design_-0.029 , operate_0.088 and maintain_-0.229 the first of the new generation_0.091 British trams in Manchester will share_0 the looks of their Milanese counterparts ."
"a3m-fragment02","77","Artists ' impressions_0.312 show_0.086 a tram that has more in common with the flat-faced_0.152 , characterless light_0.171 trains of the toy-like_-0.074 Docklands Light Railway ."
"a3m-fragment02","78","There is still time for GMA ( GEC , Mowlem , Amec and Greater Manchester Buses ) to consider_-0.062 employing an inspired architect or industrial designer ."
"a3m-fragment02","79","After all , Mancunians and visitors to the Manchester conurbation are going to have to look at these mechanical millipedes_0.531 for well into the twenty-first century ."
"a3m-fragment02","80","Now that buses are no longer designed to enhance the streets they serve_-0.033 , Manchester has a chance to make_-0.344 a fresh_-0.156 start_-0.219 with its trams ."
"a3m-fragment02","81","Manchester is not alone_-0.229 ."
"a3m-fragment02","82","Other British towns , Croydon and Southampton among them , are also considering_0 modern tramways ."
"a3m-fragment02","83","These are all referred to as ‘ supertram ’ networks , the implication being that the new-generation_0.344 tram is an altogether more dynamic_-0.088 form_0.229 of transport than its pre-war predecessors_0.294 ."
"a3m-fragment02","84","What it really means_-0.265 is that the new trams are a hybrid_0.226 between street car and lightweight suburban train ."
"a3m-fragment02","85","Although they will slip_0.061 through the city centre serving_0.182 the essential parts — shopping malls , leisure centres , theme parks , amusement arcades and museums — the Manchester supertrams will also head_-0.167 out of town on a mix_-0.333 of reserved track and existing railway lines ."

"a3p-fragment09","162","Its old churches , green fields and long beaches were cherished by the inhabitants of Essex , Suffolk , Norfolk and Cambridgeshire , but not yet on the tourist agenda ."
"a3p-fragment09","163","Today , I was told , villagers living around the great wool churches of Lavenham and Long Melford have to bar their doors and ignore the knocking of tourists , who take_-0.531 them for antique shops and offer to buy their furniture ."

"a3p-fragment09","165","East Anglia on a sunny weekend is a place of matchless beauty ."
"a3p-fragment09","166","Its villages look too good to be true ."
"a3p-fragment09","167","Lavenham and Long Melford , for example , have no telegraph poles , to preserve_0.281 the timeless air_-0.118 that pervades_0.375 them ."
"a3p-fragment09","168","Yet you only have to read Ronald Blythe 's Akenfield to realise that these picturesque , half-timbered cottages , often painted the characteristic Essex pink ( pale salmon ) , ochre or spring-leaf green , are more prosperous now than ever in the ‘ real ’ past ."
"a3p-fragment09","169","Many are still elaborately decorated with pargeting , an ornate , patterned plasterwork practised in this area since the early thirteenth century ."
"a3p-fragment09","170","Most of East Anglia 's prosperity today is due to City commuters , the second-homes market_-0.171 and tourism ."
"a3p-fragment09","171","The ideal hotel from which to explore is Dedham Hall , set among tall trees in the Vale of Dedham , looking_-0.333 directly across towards Dedham church on one side and Flatford Mill on the other : both painted by Constable ."
"a3p-fragment09","172","The hotel lies_-0.314 in five acres of fields and garden , and the Slingos , who own it , make_-0.121 the most of their beautiful surroundings by running_-0.314 painting courses_-0.147 for about_-0.406 £200 a week ( including breakfast and dinner ) , or £90 for a long_-0.412 weekend ."

"a3p-fragment09","181","After dinner there , when the moon was full_-0.226 and low and deep_-0.143 orange , we walked up the road from the hotel to Long Melford church ."
"a3p-fragment09","182","Its vast walls of flint and glass and Gothic tracery were brilliantly floodlit and the churchyard cat , sleek and black as tar , greeted_0.242 us querulously_0.667 and led_-0.171 us right round the church and through the gravestones at the back_-0.258 , glimmering and pale_-0.029 in the moonlight ."

"a4d-fragment02","71","A prayer_0.143 for the brick cathedral_0.441 facing St Paul 's : Bankside Power Station is a masterpiece worth , preserving , Gavin Stamp argues"
"a4d-fragment02","72","By GAVIN STAMP"
"a4d-fragment02","73","FROM the top of the dome of St Paul 's Cathedral the view is no longer dominated_0.229 by City church steeples but by an intrusive cacophony_0.515 of drab , characterless Sixties boxes ."
"a4d-fragment02","74","One building stands out in this dispiriting panorama of post-war mediocrity : a dark_-0.312 powerful_-0.152 mass of brickwork with a tall central tower that stands_-0.206 right across the Thames from Wren 's dome ."
"a4d-fragment02","75","This is not an office block , nor a church — although its sublime form might suggest_-0.147 that its architect was adept at designing cathedrals ."
"a4d-fragment02","76","It is , in fact , the now redundant oil-fired electric power station that sits_-0.375 on Bankside next to the site of Sam Wanamaker 's new Globe Theatre ."
"a4d-fragment02","77","Bankside Power Station should never have been built ."
"a4d-fragment02","78","Its architect had spent_-0.094 the war years with fellow Royal Academicians planning the orderly and spacious London of the future , free_-0.034 of smoke and industry ."
"a4d-fragment02","79","But , when asked in 1947 to replace an old dirty power station that had been on the site since 1891 , he soon forgot_-0.152 such idealism and , like any architect , was glad to have the job ."
"a4d-fragment02","80","The project was controversial and the power station was only permitted providing the smoke was clean and the building did not challenge_0.059 the visual dominance of St Paul 's ."
"a4d-fragment02","81","So the single chimney rose_0.088 only to 325ft , some 45ft below the height of the cross above the cathedral ."
"a4d-fragment02","82","The irony is that had the tower been higher and had the teak ‘ scrubbers ’ been less efficient , the smoke would have gone_-0.152 straight up into the air ."
"a4d-fragment02","83","As it was , the ‘ smokeless shimmer of vapour ’ was so cooled by cleaning that it drifted across the river to cause mischief_0.212 with the leadwork on Wren 's great dome ."
"a4d-fragment02","84","Bankside Power Station should not have been built ."
"a4d-fragment02","85","But , as it was built , it should not now be demolished ."
"a4d-fragment02","86","That is because it is a magnificent structure , the supreme architectural expression of the heroic_0.222 , monumental_0.364 phase of power station design and the creation_-0.028 of a great_-0.485 architect ."
"a4d-fragment02","87","Bankside was the work of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott , OM , the architect of Liverpool 's Anglican Cathedral , the rebuilt House of Commons and some of the last vital_0.125 products of the Gothic Revival ."
"a4d-fragment02","88","He was a designer of extraordinary versatility , being responsible for the standard ‘ traditional ’ red telephone kiosk , Waterloo Bridge and several power stations ."
"a4d-fragment02","89","Bankside represents the fullest_0.152 realisation of his industrial aesthetic ."
"a4d-fragment02","90","Scott 's first venture into this unlikely field_0.118 of design was at Battersea where , in 1930 , he was wheeled_0 in as a famous knighted architect by the London Power_-0.156 Company to try to make_-0.206 acceptable the coal-fired monster power station to which the residents of Chelsea and Westminster were taking_-0.265 strong_-0.031 exception ."
"a4d-fragment02","91","This was a brilliant_0.091 move_-0.242 ."
"a4d-fragment02","92","Scott was so successful in styling the building in fine brickwork with ‘ jazz-modern ’ fluting ( as John Betjeman called it ) that , when the Battersea ‘ A ’ station was opened_-0.294 in 1934 it was widely acclaimed as a supremely successful modern treatment of a building type that seemed quintessentially twentieth century ."
"a4d-fragment02","93","When , in 1939 , The Architects ' Journal conducted_0.206 a survey_0 to find_-0.412 what were considered_0.029 the best modern buildings in Britain , Battersea was placed_0.088 second — and was the favourite of such unlikely celebrities as Sir Kenneth Clark , Rebecca West and Charles Laughton ."
"a4d-fragment02","94","Scott was so pleased with the style he had evolved_0.281 at Battersea , a treatment that humanised_0.531 industrial forms without denying their function , that he also used it on the Guinness Factory at Park Royal , west London ."
"a4d-fragment02","95","At Battersea , Scott could not alter the basic design of the building and he much disliked the ‘ upturned_0.429 table_0.1 ’ appearance_0.314 created by the four corner chimneys ."
"a4d-fragment02","96","At Bankside , however , he was able to persuade the engineers , Mott , Hay & Anderson , to gather_0 all the flues into a single ‘ slender_0.484 tower or campanile ’ ."
"a4d-fragment02","97","As a result , he was able to create a symmetrical , monumental composition of great_-0.121 power_-0.235 ."
"a4d-fragment02","98","As at all his power stations , Scott faced_-0.029 the building in a fine Worcestershire brick that has weathered to a lovely pinky-brown ."
"a4d-fragment02","99","But there is nothing homely about the general effect ."
"a4d-fragment02","100","Vast overlapping planes of brickwork are modelled with careful set-backs and subtle bands of detail ."
"a4d-fragment02","101","The result is an expression of the monumental_0.25 aesthetic of the early twentieth century , with strong_-0.441 American overtones ."
"a4d-fragment02","102","When the campanile is seen from a distance , it seems to belong to some strange Expressionist church one has not noticed before ."
"a4d-fragment02","103","Not for nothing were such power stations described as ‘ brick cathedrals_0.5 ’ ; Bankside is the finest manifestation of this tradition ."
"a4d-fragment02","104","Now it is redundant ."
"a4d-fragment02","105","Smoke shimmers no longer from the tall tower ."
"a4d-fragment02","106","But Bankside is nevertheless a sound_-0.152 structure which , like the best mills of the Industrial Revolution , is well worth preserving and is perfectly capable_-0.121 of adaptation for a new commercial use ."
"a4d-fragment02","107","Such re-use is , of course , much encouraged_0.176 by a building being listed , something which , until recently , was not possible with architecture of so recent a date ."
"a4d-fragment02","108","Two years ago , however , the Department of the Environment at last began_-0.206 the listing of post-war buildings in England that were more than 30 years old ."
"a4d-fragment02","109","Bracken House , the former home_-0.455 of the Financial Times , became the first candidate_-0.114 and English Heritage then submitted_0.088 some 70 recommendations to the Department of the Environment ; these included_-0.294 Bankside ."
"a4d-fragment02","110","This , however , was too much for the Government and , using the excuse that public opinion was not yet ready_-0.294 to accept_-0.057 the protection of many unpopular modern buildings , Lord Caithness , the Minister of State for the Environment , arbitrarily whittled down English Heritage 's list to 18 buildings - excluding Bankside — although it represented a more traditional approach_0.152 in the Fifties to the now-unfashionable Modern Movement_0.147 ."
"a4d-fragment02","111","However , Caithness himself stated that this first selection was ‘ in no way_-0.469 a definitive list …"
"a4d-fragment02","112","I have no doubt that others will be added ."
"a4d-fragment02","113","The important thing_-0.469 is that the Thirty Year Rule_0 is in force_-0.156 and that we can respond_-0.059 to developing perceptions of our times . ’"
"a4d-fragment02","114","Earlier this year , in my capacity_0.303 as chairman of the Thirties Society , I asked Caithness 's successor , Virginia Bottomley , to reconsider English Heritage 's recommendation of Bankside for listing ."
"a4d-fragment02","115","My argument was that , as Michael Heseltine had so boldly_0.235 listed Battersea Power Station in 1980 , it was illogical not to protect a much finer and more complete industrial work by the same architect ."
"a4d-fragment02","116","Furthermore , the listing of Battersea had ensured the building 's survival for conversion to a new use — in that case , as an entertainment centre_0.088 which the Prime Minister herself had praised_0.171 and inaugurated ."
"a4d-fragment02","117","After two months ' silence , I was informed that ministers stood_-0.152 by their decision ."
"a4d-fragment02","118","I wrote back asking_-0.25 the reasons for this , pointing_-0.114 out that , if any large modern power station deserved_0.114 to be listed , it was Bankside ."
"a4d-fragment02","119","I have received no satisfactory reply ."
"a4d-fragment02","120","Of course , I know perfectly well why the Department of the Environment declines_0.2 to list it ."
"a4d-fragment02","121","Listed building procedures might impede the full_-0.286 commercial realisation of the site when the electricity industry is privatised ."
"a4d-fragment02","122","Furthermore , British Rail has its eyes_-0.094 on the Bankside site for bringing up the spoil from the tunnel for Channel traffic which it is , so absurdly , driving_0.147 under the middle of London at astronomical_0.147 cost ."
"a4d-fragment02","123","Listing , in theory , is an objective assessment_0.176 of architectural or historical importance which does not necessarily prevent demolition ."
"a4d-fragment02","124","In the case of Bankside Power Station , the ultimate ‘ temple_0.424 of power_-0.172 ’ and a masterpiece of industrial architecture by a major twentieth-century British architect , our historic building system_0.091 is being perverted for purely political reasons ."

"a6u-fragment02","170","The current status_0.062 of the work of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo is a dramatic_0.094 example of this change ."
"a6u-fragment02","171","Once known primarily as the wife of Diego Rivera , her reputation outside of Mexico now far_-0.424 supercedes his : since 1919 , sale room estimates of her work have risen_0.03 from $40,000 to over_-0.182 $1 million , and in 1990 a work by Kahlo broke_0.03 all records at Sotheby 's New York for a Latin American artist ."
"a6u-fragment02","172","The enormous_0 rise_-0.125 in the economic value of her work has developed in tandem_0.529 with the increased_-0.182 critical and popular response_0.094 to her particular blend_0.176 of naive_0.033 style and incisive content_0.2 ."
"a6u-fragment02","173","While the first wave_0 of popular interest arose_0.094 with the 1982 Whitechapel exhibition instigated by Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen , it was the publication of Hayden Herrera 's biography of Kahlo in 1983 which has led_-0.061 to her current cult status ."
"a6u-fragment02","174","Since that date she has been the subject of TV documentaries , a feature film ( ‘ Frida ’ by Paul Leduc ) , a stage play , numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing ."

"a6u-fragment02","176","Almost as a logical outcome of this media blitz_0.419 , it emerged_0.147 in the summer of 1990 that Madonna , already a devotee_0 of Kahlo 's work , was commissioning a screenplay based_0.094 on Kahlo 's life ."

"a6u-fragment02","179","As with most artists who have become mythical_0.686 personalities in the popular imagination , such attention has focused_-0.121 primarily on the anecdotal and tragic_0 details of Kahlo 's admittedly fascinating life ."
"a6u-fragment02","180","The passionate obsession with her husband Diego Rivera , her flamboyant appearance , but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come_-0.229 to dominate_0.286 responses_0.176 to her work ."
"a6u-fragment02","181","While Kahlo 's art helped_-0.147 her to deal_-0.086 with the vicissitudes of her life , for most audiences_0.25 it is her life story which allows_-0.118 access_0.069 to her art ."
"a6u-fragment02","182","In this one can draw_-0.265 obvious parallels_0.118 to the appeal_-0.091 of Van Gogh , a traditionally popular artist recently made_-0.062 fashionable by the media attention generated_0.188 during the centennial of his death ."

"a6u-fragment02","184","Yet despite the iconic status_-0.294 of Van Gogh 's ‘ tragic_0.118 ’ life , it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified , his thick impasto brush-stroke , his vibrant_0.133 yellows , the urgency of his creative drive_0.303 ."
"a6u-fragment02","185","In the case of Kahlo the popular image_-0.147 is of the artist herself , the characteristic brows , the elaborate hair , the Mexican costume ( Fig. 3 ) ."
"a6u-fragment02","186","It is primarily her appearance , not the formal_0.061 language_0.25 of her art , that has graced_0.147 the pages of Elle and Vogue magazines ."

"a6u-fragment02","188","In the later Vogue piece_-0.2 only the style remained as the far_-0.545 more overtly sexual , Kahloesque models_0.156 lounged and pouted in their ‘ Mexican ’ interiors ."
"a6u-fragment02","189","There is a poignant irony in the way_0.088 clothing , which on one level_-0.086 served_0 to hide Kahlo 's broken_0 body , falls or is lifted by the model_-0.061 to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique ( Fig. 4 ) ."
"a6u-fragment02","190","The visual references in the two magazines are as much from photos of the artist as from her work ."

"a6u-fragment02","192","While Elle , Vogue and subsequently The Independent ( Fig. 5 ) , stressed_0.143 different facets_0.375 of Kahlo 's public persona , they all shared_-0.152 the emphasis_0.152 on ‘ her ’ , as an encapsulisation_0.531 of stereotypical_0.233 images_0.03 of Mexico , rather than her work ."

"a6u-fragment02","199","Of course , the line_-0.323 between art and life is a particularly hard_-0.265 one to draw_0.212 in Kahlo 's case ."
"a6u-fragment02","200","The majority of her work is self portraiture ; her aesthetic concerns grew_-0.176 from her fascination with the falsity of appearance ."
"a6u-fragment02","201","Dressing up , role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of Kahlo 's work ."
"a6u-fragment02","202","In Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair ( 1944 ) ( Fig. 6 ) , she paints herself wearing Rivera 's suit , challenging_-0.206 traditional expectations of femininity and attempting to appropriate_0.242 his authority ( while simultaneously ) threatening castration ) ."
"a6u-fragment02","203","More disturbingly , in The Mask_0.394 ( 1945 ) ( Fig. 7 ) , she throws_0.065 doubt on too straightforward a reading_-0.029 of her self-portraits as revealing_0.412 of her inner_-0.212 emotions ."
"a6u-fragment02","204","Where does the mask_0.5 fall_-0.033 : Does not the ritual_0.273 repetition of those familiar features_0.257 ‘ mask_0.412 ’ far more than it uncovers_0.219 ?"
"a6u-fragment02","205","There is , however , an inevitable logic to the appropriation_0.611 of her meticulously constructed_-0.065 image_0 , a process which the artist was mocking as early as 1933 : ‘ … some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress ‘ a la Mexicana ’ , but the poor_0.03 souls only look like cabbages_0.559 and to tell you the naked_0.212 truth they look absolutely impossible . '"
"a6u-fragment02","206","The ‘ impossibility_0.424 ’ stemmed_0.091 from the failure of such followers to recognise_0.088 the symbolic importance of Kahlo 's choice of clothing , a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearances ."
"a6u-fragment02","207","The particularities of post-revolutionary Mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic , by the generalised attractiveness_0.235 of the radical avant-garde ."
"a6u-fragment02","208","For Kahlo , however , choosing_0.121 to don the costume of the Tehuana , as for example in Tree of Hope ( 1946 ) ( Fig. 8 ) , was to embody a powerful_0.171 icon_0.029 of cultural identity ."
"a6u-fragment02","209","Mexican Indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and by and large geographically specific , varying from region to region ."
"a6u-fragment02","210","The Tehuana dress is by no means the most decorative variant or the closest_-0.194 to pre-Hispanic forms_0.031 of clothing ."
"a6u-fragment02","211","It is the mythology surrounding_0.176 the women wearers of the costume which directed_0.333 Kahlo 's choice ."
"a6u-fragment02","212","The ostensibly matriarchal society of Tehuantepec led_-0.176 to the adoption_0.229 of the Tehuana , in post-revolutionary Mexico , as the image_-0.121 of the strong Indian woman ; the undefeated counterpart to the despised ‘ Chingada ’ , who , conversely is the female embodiment of Mexico 's hybrid_0.5 post-conquest culture ."
"a6u-fragment02","213","In a culture where sexual metaphors are frequently used to convey_0.156 racial and political conflict , the Tehuana represents_0 that aspect_0.059 of Mexico 's indigenous_0.375 tradition unbowed_0.543 by centuries of colonial and male rule_-0.121 ."
"a6u-fragment02","214","Kahlo 's adoption_0.294 of Tehuana dress , while being an attractive_-0.061 disguise_0.242 of what she saw_-0.156 as a less than perfect body , asserted_0.114 both a feminist and an anti-colonialist position_0.121 ."

"a6u-fragment02","235","This ‘ appropriateness ’ of Kahlo 's aesthetic to contemporary debate has tended to remove_-0.152 her work from its historical context_-0.086 , to stress_-0.229 the collective and the cross-cultural ."
"a6u-fragment02","236","Although this is not in itself to be dismissed_0.212 as a tactic_0.121 , it has diminished the complexity of Kahlo 's achievement as a specifically Mexican painter , operating_0.412 within the particularities of her historical moment ."
"a6u-fragment02","237","More problematic is the way_-0.206 in which such a dislocation_0.143 has led_-0.059 to the acceptance of her ‘ Mexicanness ’ as mere decoration_0.353 of the essentially feminist themes of her work , thereby defusing_0.5 a substantial part_-0.242 of the art described by Breton as a ‘ ribbon_0.143 round a bomb_0.286 ’ ."

"a6u-fragment02","241","The story behind Hale 's death was one with which Kahlo obviously identified_0.176 , and within which dress formed an important symbolic function ."
"a6u-fragment02","242","Before jumping from the window of her apartment , Hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress , the corsage of yellow roses a gift from a male admirer ."

"a6u-fragment02","253","On one level_-0.206 this work deals_-0.091 with a generalised ‘ woman 's experience ’ , yet the metaphorical power_0.286 of Dorothy Hale 's dress derives_0.182 from Kahlo 's use of clothing in her own self-portraits ."

"a7s-fragment03","41","THERE was one point_-0.343 when the hair on the back_-0.235 of my head began to lift ."
"a7s-fragment03","42","Not at Paul Hill 's remembrance of beatings past_-0.242 , when he could hear the sound of steel-tipped boots running_0.265 to take_-0.294 part_-0.294 in the fun , and once heard a principal medical officer , no less , telling colleagues : ‘ Do n't walk his face , do n't walk his face . ’"
"a7s-fragment03","43","Not even the time he was dunked head first in a tub of dubious liquid , and brought up gasping for breath : ‘ Make_-0.4 him sing God Save the Queen ! ’ they shouted ."
"a7s-fragment03","44","Brutality , as Hill describes and felt_0 it , was a bitter_0.229 part_-0.412 of his prison life ; you just learnt to get down on the floor as fast as you could and cover up as best you could ."
"a7s-fragment03","45","But it was Gerry Conlon 's account_-0.125 of being interrogated after the Guildford bombings that made_-0.4 the scalp crawl_0.412 ."
"a7s-fragment03","46","We know your mother works at the Royal Victoria Hospital , they told him , we know where your sister works , and there are sectarian killings down there ."
"a7s-fragment03","47","‘ They told me they could arrange_0.03 an ‘ accident ’ ."
"a7s-fragment03","48","And I believed they were capable of murdering my mother , I honestly believe they would have murdered my mother — that 's why I signed the statement . ’"
"a7s-fragment03","49","The account_-0.147 he gave_-0.588 just after his release was that the threat had been that a British soldier might ‘ accidentally ’ shoot one of the women ."
"a7s-fragment03","50","A few months ago even , this would have seemed improbable ."
"a7s-fragment03","51","You might have assumed_-0.121 this was the police bluffing_0.471 and bullying_0.125 ."
"a7s-fragment03","52","Yet given what we have learned about links_0.083 between the security services and the Loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland , and the deep_0.156 suspicion about surrogate murders , you ca n't shrug_0.125 off the shiver Conlon 's words bring_-0.129 ."
"a7s-fragment03","53","There were daunting moments in last night 's First Tuesday ( Yorkshire ) , but few of them matched_0.229 that hint_-0.057 of a jackboot_0.194 under the blue_0.118 serge_0.5 ."
"a7s-fragment03","54","It 's right that the Guildford Four have told their stories now to Grant McKee and Ros Franey and First Tuesday , the programme and the producers who dug_0.033 away_-0.118 , and did much to keep_0.029 the case_-0.242 alive_0.143 ."
"a7s-fragment03","55","And they told it without on-screen questioning , though the programme is skilfully structured to give_-0.4 it a coherence it might have lacked ."
"a7s-fragment03","56","Carole Richardson 's is the most haunting face ."
"a7s-fragment03","57","You have to hope that its blankness_0.25 will slowly dissolve_0.485 and let_-0.371 life in ."
"a7s-fragment03","58","Just once a couple of tears rolled down ."
"a7s-fragment03","59","It was when she described seeing film of the results of the bombing on television , and thinking : ‘ They think I did that ! ’"
"a7s-fragment03","60","Armstrong seems the least permanently damaged_0.25 on the surface_-0.176 ."
"a7s-fragment03","61","He pays_-0.094 tribute_0.147 to his treatment at Gartree prison , he apologises to the bomb victims ' families that they have had to keep reminding them of their loss_-0.306 : ‘ But we had to fight_-0.176 for our freedom . ’"
"a7s-fragment03","62","Hill expresses_0.121 the way_-0.469 time has cheated_-0.25 them : his daughter was born while he was remanded in custody , and is now 14 : ‘ She would change_-0.188 dramatically_0.2 and I did n't feel_-0.424 a change_-0.147 in myself mentally ."
"a7s-fragment03","63","I 'm still 20 in my head ."
"a7s-fragment03","64","Nothing 's happened to me ."
"a7s-fragment03","65","I have n't lived . ’"
"a7s-fragment03","66","But again it was Conlon , the slightly wild-eyed Irish poet of the quartet , articulate , flamboyant — remember that extraordinary exit through the front door of the Old Bailey — who cut_0.176 deep_0 into the collective conscience_0.306 ."
"a7s-fragment03","67","He described being taken over the years to see his sick , and finally dying and almost certainly innocent father in another prison ."
"a7s-fragment03","68","He was convicted with the Maguires in the parallel_0.235 case of a ‘ bomb factory ’ ."
"a7s-fragment03","69","And he tells how none of the assembled guards and officials could look his father in the eye as he protested his innocence ."
"a7s-fragment03","70","Only the nurses could do that ."
"a7s-fragment03","71","And at the end_-0.303 , Conlon drew_0.03 the one hopeful conclusion : ‘ If this stops capital punishment ever coming_-0.455 back , the time I 've spent_-0.176 in prison will be well worth it ."
"a7s-fragment03","72","If this stops another innocent person going to prison , it 'll be well worth it …"
"a7s-fragment03","73","‘ I 've had numerous prison governors say to me , Yes , Conlon , we know you 're innocent , but there 's nothing we can do about it ."
"a7s-fragment03","74","We get_-0.353 a custody order , and that 's it ."

"a7w-fragment01","26","They move in today ."
"a7w-fragment01","27","What has gone_-0.353 wrong ?"
"a7w-fragment01","28","There are three key causes of the shambles_0.29 : Mr Kenneth Clarke ; the failure to separate_0.25 emergency from non-emergency work ; and the Whitley Council negotiating machinery_0.424 ."
"a7w-fragment01","29","The Health Secretary accused_0 the unions of ‘ posturing_0.219 and pretending_0.265 ’ to run_-0.114 a 999 service yesterday ."

"a7w-fragment01","31","By refusing to keep_-0.333 open_-0.382 two-way_0.229 radio links_0.294 , the crews had effectively ended a proper emergency service ."
"a7w-fragment01","32","The move_-0.343 was signalled_0.176 last week and , true_-0.323 to their promised response_-0.059 , management suspended_0.171 the workers involved in the disruption ."
"a7w-fragment01","33","But ‘ posturing_0.455 and pretending_0.471 ’ went_-0.5 far_-0.176 beyond the unions ."
"a7w-fragment01","34","Mr Clarke has been indulging in just that himself , putting_-0.059 up the luckless Duncan Nichol , chief executive of the health service , to take_-0.353 the initial flak_0.412 under the pretence that the dispute is not his direct_-0.182 responsibility ."
"a7w-fragment01","35","Yet it was Mr Clarke , not Mr Nichol , who was involved in the critical_0.065 decisions — the cash limit_-0.059 for the NHS , the 6.5 per cent offer to ambulance workers ( compared_-0.152 to seven per cent for nurses , eight per cent for doctors and nine per cent for ancillary workers ) ; and today 's introduction_0.03 of military ambulances ."
"a7w-fragment01","36","Ambulance workers on emergency work do deserve a much higher_-0.062 increase ."
"a7w-fragment01","37","They have progressed_0.143 far_-0.212 beyond routine first aid ."

"a7y-fragment03","175","The facts ."
"a7y-fragment03","176","Mrs Bujok and her family occupied a house as council tenants ."
"a7y-fragment03","177","In September 1988 Mrs Bujok laid_-0.067 an information against the council alleging the existence and continuance of a statutory nuisance under section_-0.094 92(1) of the Public Health Act 1936 ."
"a7y-fragment03","178","It was alleged that the council , being the owners of the premises , were the persons by whose act , default or sufferance the nuisance arose_0.059 ."
"a7y-fragment03","179","Prior to laying_0.258 the information Mrs Bujok had not served_-0.147 an abatement notice upon the council or informed them of the alleged defects in the premises ."
"a7y-fragment03","180","The justices held_-0.219 Mrs Bujok was not required to ensure that the council were aware of the defective state of the property prior to laying_0.29 the information ."
"a7y-fragment03","181","The council appealed_0.182 by case stated ."
"a7y-fragment03","182","The legislation ."
"a7y-fragment03","183","Section_0.212 92(1) of the 1936 Act defines_-0.182 ‘ statutory nuisances ’ as ‘ any premises in such a state as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance ’ ."
"a7y-fragment03","184","The decision ."
"a7y-fragment03","185","Mr Justice Hutchison said the 1936 Act primarily envisages_0.529 a system_0.061 where the local authority has a power_-0.258 and a duty to try_-0.606 to secure_-0.2 that premises are not in a state which constitutes a statutory nuisance ."
"a7y-fragment03","186","Action_-0.029 is initiated_0.097 by the service_0.171 of an abatement notice requiring remedial_0.188 work ."
"a7y-fragment03","187","If the person in default fails to comply with an abatement notice the local authority is obliged_0.531 to make_-0.406 a complaint to the magistrates ."
"a7y-fragment03","188","If the complaint is proved , a nuisance order is made_-0.406 requiring the defendant to get_-0.765 the necessary work done ."
"a7y-fragment03","189","Effectively the sequence is that the person in default is told what is wrong and is required to put_-0.355 it right ."
"a7y-fragment03","190","He is given_-0.472 an opportunity to do so , and if he does not , he is subject to sanctions by the court to compel him to do so ."
"a7y-fragment03","191","The problem arises_0.059 in connection with section_-0.118 99 which adapts_0.242 or applies_0 the provisions to cases where an individual rather than the local authority wishes to make_-0.394 the complaint ."
"a7y-fragment03","192","Need he serve_0.094 an abatement notice ?"
"a7y-fragment03","193","The authorities plainly_-0.121 establish that he need not and can not do so ."
"a7y-fragment03","194","Does that mean_-0.147 he may lay_-0.118 an information and bring_0.031 the matter before the magistrates without first putting_-0.324 the person alleged to be in default on notice of what is alleged ?"
"a7y-fragment03","195","The council argued_0.088 that a landlord , particularly one such as a local authority , can not realistically be expected to have a system_-0.212 of inspection of all its premises and in practice is entitled_0.406 to depend upon notification by its tenants ."
"a7y-fragment03","196","For Mrs Bujok it was argued that the 1936 Act was designed_0.171 to secure_0.097 in the interests_0.212 of the community_-0.25 at large that statutory nuisances did not exist ."
"a7y-fragment03","197","It was submitted that an owner can not turn_-0.375 his back_-0.375 on his property because when he purchases and takes on the responsibility of letting , he knows the property will in the course_0.206 of time deteriorate ."
"a7y-fragment03","198","He must therefore satisfy himself on a regular_-0.156 basis that it does not constitute a statutory nuisance ."
"a7y-fragment03","199","In Warner v Lambeth London Borough Council ( 1985 ) 15 HLR 45 , 50 , Lord Justice Glidewell said a private person could lay_-0.088 an information alleging the failure to abate a statutory nuisance without first giving_-0.433 notice requiring abatement ."
"a7y-fragment03","200","Therefore in the present case the justices came_-0.471 to the correct conclusion ."
"a7y-fragment03","201","His Lordship reached_-0.029 that decision without enthusiasm because it seemed that as a matter of common sense_-0.353 , notice should be given_-0.176 in such circumstances before criminal proceedings were launched_0.088 ."
"a7y-fragment03","202","Lord Justice Watkins said he agreed with reluctance ."
"a7y-fragment03","203","It was surely repugnant to commonsense_-0.031 that in this area_-0.176 of legal activity a local authority should be prosecuted by one of its tenants without first being given_-0.294 the opportunity by that tenant to remedy the consequences of a neglect to repair the dwelling that the tenant occupied ."
"a7y-fragment03","204","In law there was no doubt that Mrs Bujok was entitled_-0.065 to commence proceedings without giving_-0.457 notice of the state of the dwelling to the council ."
"a7y-fragment03","205","But in every other conceivable way_-0.294 that action_0.088 was entirely wrong ."
"a7y-fragment03","206","Endless trouble to many people in courts and council offices_0.03 and much money could be saved_-0.171 by the giving_-0.382 of notice of disrepair ."
"a7y-fragment03","207","If the council did not react_-0.094 to that notice , then would be the time for the tenant to exercise_0.147 the right to prosecute ."
"a7y-fragment03","208","Parliament should give_-0.588 fresh_0.114 thought to enacting_0.061 a provision placing_0.176 an obligation upon a council tenant to give_-0.625 notice to the council before being permitted to commence proceedings ."

"a8r-fragment02","35","He finds out what the needs_0.152 of the business are , and prescribes_0.618 the cure_-0.032 ."
"a8r-fragment02","36","The user tells the analyst what the problems are , and the analyst decides , at least in broad_0 terms_-0.143 , what the user requires ."

"a8r-fragment02","47","What 's wrong with the old system anyway ? ’"
"a8r-fragment02","48","The only way_-0.387 to develop a prototype is for the analyst to get_-0.545 inside the head of the user and , thinking like a user , decide what sort of system is required ."
"a8r-fragment02","49","Of course , the initial system will not be perfect ."
"a8r-fragment02","50","The analyst can not hope to understand the business as well in a few weeks as the user does after many years ."

"a8r-fragment02","54","Initially the analyst does all the work , leading_-0.062 the user towards a system he thinks is right for the business ."
"a8r-fragment02","55","But once the user sees_-0.25 the potential of the system , a change_0.091 in attitude_0.061 takes_-0.206 place_-0.235 ."
"a8r-fragment02","56","The process becomes demand driven by the user ."
"a8r-fragment02","57","The analyst is then forced_0.152 on the defensive_0 , explaining why new_-0.871 features_0.121 can not be included because they are technically difficult or prohibitively_0.545 expensive ."
"a8r-fragment02","58","Traditionally , systems were validated by users agreeing functional specifications ."
"a8r-fragment02","59","In theory , validation meant_0.094 that the user had read the specification , imagined how the system would work_-0.382 in practice , and agreed the design_0.286 ."
"a8r-fragment02","60","It was only when using a ‘ test ’ version of the system ( available just before the planned_-0.257 implementation date ) that difficulties would come_-0.265 to light_0.088 , and a host of change_0.088 requests be issued ."
"a8r-fragment02","61","The advent of fourth generation_-0.118 languages_0.059 ( 4GLs ) has made_-0.182 system development much easier ."
"a8r-fragment02","62","With a 4GL an initial prototype can be put_-0.303 together_-0.235 quickly ."
"a8r-fragment02","63","This means_-0.486 feedback_0.03 is obtained early in the development process , and the system can grow_-0.091 around the user 's requirements ."
"a8r-fragment02","64","Crucial to the development process is the relationship built_-0.176 up between the analyst and the user ."
"a8r-fragment02","65","The best systems arise_0.265 when both have a deep_-0.303 understanding of each other 's jobs ."
"a8r-fragment02","66","Many developers use_-0.467 business analysts to ensure that the development team_-0.265 maintain_-0.273 a proper focus_-0.088 on business requirements ."
"a8r-fragment02","67","But this can be counter-productive , as it cuts_-0.118 off communication between the systems analyst and the user ."
"a8r-fragment02","68","Too much specialisation is bad for systems development ; it feeds_-0.057 the temptation to get engrossed in technical difficulties and forget about the underlying_0.059 business needs ."

"a98-fragment03","54","One of their main assignments was to contact Edoardo Amaldi , a physicist thought to be in hiding near Rome ."
"a98-fragment03","55","Six months later , the day before_-0.545 Rome 's liberation by the Allies , Amaldi was found ."
"a98-fragment03","56","He was interviewed by Moe Berg , then one of the most famous baseball players in America ."
"a98-fragment03","57","Berg was also an agent of the Office of Strategic Services , which was later to give_-0.265 birth_0.031 to the CIA ."
"a98-fragment03","58","His job was to convince Amaldi to pack_0.094 his bags_0 because there was a ship waiting_-0.061 at Naples to take_-0.419 him to the United States ."
"a98-fragment03","59","Amaldi 's presence there had been sought by two other Italian colleagues , also physicists ."
"a98-fragment03","60","His mentor , Enrico Fermi , later to be called ‘ the father_0.139 of the bomb ’ , and Emilio Segre ( who died in California earlier this year ) ."
"a98-fragment03","61","Amaldi dodged_0 the American invitation , perhaps because ( with Rome liberated ) Fermi 's mantle_0.656 in physics had fallen_-0.029 on his young_0.235 shoulders_0.114 and there were younger_0.029 minds to teach_0.118 ."
"a98-fragment03","62","He wore_-0.091 that mantle_0.455 well at Rome University until his retirement in 1978 ."
"a98-fragment03","63","But Amaldi never really retired_0.03 nor grew old ."
"a98-fragment03","64","He kept_-0.265 regular_-0.091 hours in the university 's physics building , spoke at scientific meetings this year in Moscow and Washington ."
"a98-fragment03","65","As President of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei he had delivered_0.242 the welcoming address on Tuesday to a symposium of scientists ."
"a98-fragment03","66","He then ordered a car to call_0 for him the next morning for a similar occasion and was felled_0.394 by a stroke_-0.147 while waiting for the lift ."
"a98-fragment03","67","Amaldi grew up in a small town in Lombardy , and took_-0.484 his doctorate in physics from Rome at the remarkably early age of 21 ."
"a98-fragment03","68","In 1929 , he became one of the ragazzi di Via Panisperna — the street where Fermi 's ‘ kids ’ carried out their own experiments under the master_0.091 in their own under-financed lab ."
"a98-fragment03","69","Emilio Segre was one kid , and Bruno Pontecorvo , later to defect from Britain to the Soviet Union , another ."
"a98-fragment03","70","It is interesting to note_-0.188 that the ‘ pope_0.176 ’ — as the kids called Fermi — ‘ because he 's always right ’ , was only seven years older than Amaldi ."
"a98-fragment03","71","Amaldi astounded_0.469 his group_0.029 in October 1934 with his discovery that by slowing down , rather than accelerating , neutrons , he could provoke_0.273 intense nuclear reactions ."
"a98-fragment03","72","He held_-0.303 a chair in physics from 1937 until his retirement publishing more than 150 papers on atomic and nuclear physics ."
"a98-fragment03","73","He was awarded_-0.156 honorary degrees by Algiers , Glasgow and Oxford ."

"a9j-fragment01","3","Its two main slogans , repeated countless times in the directives issued_0.029 by the underground_0.294 leadership , are freedom_-0.088 and independence ."
"a9j-fragment01","4","It has employed_0.312 a dual strategy_0.121 to achieve these two objectives_-0.121 ."
"a9j-fragment01","5","First , a comprehensive civil disobedience campaign_0.343 was begun by which people severed_0.469 , or minimised_0.171 , all the contact_0.031 points_0.156 by which they were bound_0.312 to the Israeli occupation authority ."
"a9j-fragment01","6","This campaign_0.056 included resignations of Palestinian officials from public posts , the boycott of Israeli goods and products , and the refusal to pay taxes and fines ."
"a9j-fragment01","7","Partial and full_-0.212 strikes_0.031 , demonstrations , sit-ins , conventions … all these have in fact only constituted the outer_-0.086 layer_0.219 of an inner_-0.065 mechanism_0.206 of civilian rebellion ."
"a9j-fragment01","8","The second , and complementary , part_-0.375 of the Intifada strategy concentrated_0.219 on the construction_0.091 of an indigenous national authority ."
"a9j-fragment01","9","As Israel 's authority was being lifted_0.2 , the population began creating an alternative authority of their own ."
"a9j-fragment01","10","Popular committees were established in villages , refugee camps , suburbs , streets , in fact in every community ."
"a9j-fragment01","11","Some headway_0.457 was made_-0.176 in expanding_-0.094 self-sufficiency , whether through utilising more land for agriculture , developing home_-0.088 economies , or encouraging_-0.188 local manufacturers and products ."
"a9j-fragment01","12","Villages and refugee camps were thus being developed into ‘ liberated_0.371 ’ or ‘ independent ’ areas , if not militarily , then at least psychologically , politically and infrastructurally ."
"a9j-fragment01","13","Bloody clashes_0.324 would occur whenever armoured units raided these villages , storming through makeshift defensive road blocks and responding_0.212 to rocks being thrown with live_0.057 bullets and tear gas ; but no sooner would these army units be gone_-0.361 than authority would revert to the village residents ."
"a9j-fragment01","14","Palestinian flags would be raised on minarets and church spires , road blocks would again be erected , and life in all its aspects_0.161 would once again be run_-0.258 by the local leadership ."
"a9j-fragment01","15","The structure_0.457 of the developing national authority has been both diffuse_0.194 enough to prevent it from being destroyed_0.486 by any one single sweep_0.219 of arrests ( there have been more than 50,000 arrests since the Intifada 's outbreak ) , and coherent enough to allow_-0.412 for the existence of a unified resistance_0.206 strategy ."
"a9j-fragment01","16","While the entire network_-0.086 of popular committees , local institutions and the general public constitute_0.176 the field_0.143 commanders_0.03 in the battle_0.143 of civilian disobedience and of constructing_0.143 a political infrastructure , a rotating_0.226 Unified National Command acts_-0.091 in the role_-0.091 of field-general , issuing a bi-monthly directive outlining_0.257 policy and determining specific resistance_0.059 programmes ."
"a9j-fragment01","17","A high_-0.471 level_0.156 of mobility_0.455 in the structure_0.171 allows_0.029 for continuous_-0.303 interchange_0.118 of roles_0.171 and ideas , and retains_0.156 for the Unified National Command the closeness_0.441 to grass_0.419 roots_0.061 that is required to make_-0.229 it truly reflect_0 people 's wishes and sentiments ."
"a9j-fragment01","18","THIS expanded_0.278 network_0.088 of popular committees and institutions making_-0.294 up the Unified leadership is infused_0.371 by tens of thousands of activists who belong_-0.118 to , or identify_-0.059 with , the different factions of the PLO ."
"a9j-fragment01","19","In effect , therefore , the PLO exists_0.061 at all levels_-0.125 of organisation within the occupied territories ."
"a9j-fragment01","20","Thus the Palestinian national movement_0.219 both inside and outside the occupied territories is an organic_0.257 whole ."

"a9j-fragment01","22","Thrusts_0.441 of resistance_0.455 ( mass demonstrations , resignations , tax rebellions , etc ) would come_-0.156 in crests_0.382 ."
"a9j-fragment01","23","The pattern_0 is determined by a wide_-0.171 variety of factors , including what the Israeli army does ."
"a9j-fragment01","24","But the relation_0.257 is complex , not uni-directional_0.333 ."
"a9j-fragment01","25","Harsh_-0.029 measures_0.235 — putting_0.182 an entire community under an absolute curfew for a continuous_0 lengthy period of time , demolishing homes , uprooting olive or citrus trees , physical intimidation and terror tactics employed_0.121 by raiding army units , shooting , killing , cutting_0.029 off water or electricity supplies and telephone links_-0.065 to villages or towns , mass arrests , intimidatory interrogation techniques — can either create a temporary lull or activate_0.25 an eruption_0.333 ."

"a9j-fragment01","28","The wave-like_-0.120 pattern_-0.121 of the Intifada , its pains_0.029 and sufferings_0.394 , are all reminiscent_0.469 of the process_0.323 of birth_0.03 ."
"a9j-fragment01","29","The metaphor is apt , as Palestinians regard_0.033 themselves as engaging in a process of giving_0 birth_0.212 to their independent Palestinian state ."
"a9j-fragment01","30","Through their revolution_0.2 , the masses_0.257 are both mother_0.061 and midwife_0.222 to the birth_0.29 of this state ."
"a9j-fragment01","31","The Intifada is the midwife_0.467 of freedom_0 ."
"a9j-fragment01","32","Through it , Palestinians are struggling_0.067 on a daily basis to shake_0.258 off Israel 's authority and to construct_0.4 their own ."
"a9j-fragment01","33","The struggle_0.171 reflects_0.091 a revolution_0.286 in mass consciousness_0.312 , by which people have come_-0.4 to realise that ideas and aspirations must be embodied in manifest acts if reality is to be changed_0.088 ."
"a9j-fragment01","34","Thus , wherever one looks_-0.242 , one finds_-0.097 people engaged in the construction_0.286 of the blocks_-0.03 that will make_-0.382 up the Palestinian state ."
"a9j-fragment01","35","It is a conscious_0.258 effort ."
"a9j-fragment01","36","The masses_0.194 are being engaged in the craft_0.324 of state-masonry_0.206 ."
"a9j-fragment01","37","In this process of state building_0.229 , many stages_-0.091 have been covered_-0.406 ."
"a9j-fragment01","38","The Declaration of Independence issued_-0.028 by the Palestine National Council ( PNC ) on November 15 last year constitutes a major landmark_0.314 along this road_-0.303 ."
"a9j-fragment01","39","Its significance lies_0.065 in its double_-0.194 message_0.059 : that the aim_-0.059 of the Palestinian struggle_0.121 is the establishment of Palestinian independence , and that this independence is regarded_0.257 as being not at Israel 's expense_0.219 ."
"a9j-fragment01","40","This has been a constant theme of Intifada policy : that we wish to build_-0.235 ( Palestine ) , not to destroy_0.324 ( Israel ) ; that we wish to achieve freedom_-0.147 ( for our people ) , not to deprive others ( Israelis ) of it ; that we wish to protect and save lives ( ours ) , not to endanger the lives of others ( Israelis ) ."
"a9j-fragment01","41","In one of several Intifada leaflets written in Hebrew and addressed_0.118 to the Israeli soldiers on duty in the occupied territories , the message_-0.059 was repeated : Soldier , go home ."
"a9j-fragment01","42","Return to your family and children ."
"a9j-fragment01","43","Be with them in peace so that we may remain with our family and children in peace ."
"a9j-fragment01","44","We do not wish to harm_-0.353 you , or your state ."
"a9j-fragment01","45","We wish to be unharmed_0.406 , in our own state ."
"a9j-fragment01","46","How can the process of state building_0.121 be developed ?"
"a9j-fragment01","47","If the PNC Declaration of Independence constituted a major landmark_0.194 in this process , the time has come_-0.375 to embark_0.529 on another major step_-0.059 , that of declaring_0.034 the setting_-0.088 up of a state or government structure_0 ."
"a9j-fragment01","48","AN ESCALATION of the Intifada in this direction_0.059 would serve_0.118 two purposes at once ."
"a9j-fragment01","49","First , it would consolidate_0.258 the structures_0.062 of the developing_0 national authority which is competing_0.143 to replace_-0.133 the occupation authority ."
"a9j-fragment01","50","Second , it would consolidate_0.484 the image_0.088 and essence_0.156 of the Intifada as a constructive , not a destructive , force_-0.03 ."
"a9j-fragment01","51","Naturally , to embark_0.469 on such a step_-0.121 is not necessarily to succeed immediately_0.061 in realising it ."
"a9j-fragment01","52","Rather , it is a challenge_-0.129 ."
"a9j-fragment01","53","It will be a further challenge_0.219 to Israel 's occupation , conceived_0.471 in the image_0.097 of earlier challenges_-0.121 of the Intifada ."
"a9j-fragment01","54","But it will also be a challenge_-0.188 to us , Palestinians , summoning_0.324 us to work more energetically towards the idea 's fulfilment ."
"a9j-fragment01","55","It would be a natural_-0.176 extension_0.333 of the Intifada 's dual strategy_-0.097 towards disengagement_0.032 from Israel , and the corresponding process of state building_0.265 ."
"a9j-fragment01","56","It would further_-0.161 naturalise_0.394 and legitimise the evolving_0.029 skeletal_0.515 form_0.156 of Palestinian independence ."
"a9j-fragment01","57","It would provide the multitudinous popular committees and activities with a more advanced form_-0.188 of organisation and structure_-0.219 ."
"a9j-fragment01","58","It would enable better planning and performance ."
"a9j-fragment01","59","It would maximise_0.065 civilian tactics_-0.062 of resistance_0.062 and defuse_0.121 the natural_-0.171 potential for violence , containing_0.182 and eventually eliminating the marginal_0.323 but intrusive phenomenon of collaborator activation by Israeli security authorities and collaborator execution by local Palestinians ."
"a9j-fragment01","60","It would create a further fact that would put_-0.125 Israel on the spot_-0.176 ."
"a9j-fragment01","61","Israel 's reaction_0.065 , however hostile_0.235 , could only further our cause ."
"a9j-fragment01","62","Arresting or deporting the tens of thousands of Palestinian professionals who would be employed in perfectly apolitical , harmless_0.061 and humanitarian jobs can only further_-0.121 isolate_0.382 the Israeli Government ."
"a9j-fragment01","63","Half-way_0.265 measures_0.059 can only imply_0.059 half-way_0.062 success ."
"a9j-fragment01","64","A modus vivendi would also imply_0.156 success ."
"a9j-fragment01","65","In general , our policy should be to proceed_-0.088 with building_-0.059 our state block_0.176 by block_-0.029 , without waiting to be given_-0.25 a gift_-0.118 of it through negotiations ."
"a9j-fragment01","66","We should regard_-0.125 negotiations rather as the means_0 by which we could establish formal_0.094 agreements between our state and Israel ."
"a9j-fragment01","67","Such agreements can range_-0.094 from the issue of borders_0.152 to the issue of free_0.03 wave-lengths for our future television and radio networks ."
"a9j-fragment01","68","In the meantime , we have the capacity_0.059 to bring_-0.485 coherence and organisation to a whole_-0.059 range_0.065 of activities , further_-0.161 consolidating the institutional linkage_0.529 between the people in the occupied state and the PLO leadership ."
"a9j-fragment01","69","Entire departments can be set_-0.441 up , in health , foreign affairs , agriculture , trade , finance , education , justice , religion , information and social welfare ."
"a9j-fragment01","70","A pyramid_0.333 administrative structure_0.097 , establishing links_0.114 from popular committees in villages right up to the Executive Committee of the PLO ( in its capacity_-0.152 as a Cabinet ) , can be established ."
"a9j-fragment01","71","During the Intifada the people have been engaged_0.4 in building_0.029 the side_0 walls_0 ."
"a9j-fragment01","72","A government would provide the roof_0.229 which would bring_-0.206 these walls_-0.065 together_-0.03 ."
"a9j-fragment01","73","It would add_-0.5 another necessary touch_0.353 in the process of creating a Palestinian home_-0.088 ."

"aa3-fragment08","214","By Daniel John"
"aa3-fragment08","215","GEORGE Tyson is not a gambling_0.438 man nor does he take_-0.394 unnecessary risks ."
"aa3-fragment08","216","He does n't smoke or drink , and even if he wanted to , two heart attacks and a by-pass operation have made_-0.206 the decision_0.129 for him ."
"aa3-fragment08","217","By his own account_0.25 , Mr Tyson is thrifty and states quite proudly that neither he or his wife Rosie are a burden_0.176 on any form_-0.147 of social or government support_-0.182 ."
"aa3-fragment08","218","But that is why , at the age of 68 , Mr Tyson is not enjoying what he had hoped would be a comfortable_-0.057 retirement ."
"aa3-fragment08","219","A life of saving_-0.088 had , by 1985 , given_-0.382 them a small nest-egg of £15,000 on which the interest would help_0.031 supplement their pensions ."
"aa3-fragment08","220","To the Tysons , that meant_-0.062 nothing extravagant — just an extra £135 a month to make_-0.286 life at home_-0.171 in South Ruislip , Middlesex easier ."
"aa3-fragment08","221","That money was invested as might be expected of the Tysons ."
"aa3-fragment08","222","And for three years , it earned_0.094 its return_-0.114 , every month ."
"aa3-fragment08","223","Until one morning in June 1988 when George Tyson turned on the radio to hear a small , investment business called Barlow Clowes had collapsed_0.406 ."
"aa3-fragment08","224","‘ It was about_-0.429 8.30am and I was just getting dressed when it came_-0.656 over on the news , ’ said Mr Tyson , a former clerk of works at Harrow council , London ."
"aa3-fragment08","225","Investors in Barlow Clowes since 1985 , the Tysons had orginally put_-0.394 £10,000 into the UK fund and £5,000 in Gibraltar-based Barlow Clowes International ( BCI ) ."
"aa3-fragment08","226","Fate determined that a short_-0.029 while before the businesses failed_-0.152 , they transferred_0.143 the £10,000 to BCI because of the better returns_0 being offered ."
"aa3-fragment08","227","In the days that followed_-0.061 , the Tysons found_-0.242 that they and 18,000 other investors had been the victims_0.057 of a financial crash_-0.121 of global proportions ."
"aa3-fragment08","228","Of the £190million invested in both funds , BCI investors faced_0 a shortfall of up to £100million ."
"aa3-fragment08","229","After the initial shock_-0.182 and disbelief , the Tysons grew angry — at the advisers who convinced them about Barlow Clowes , at the Midland bank manager who gave_-0.333 verbal assurances of its security_0.147 , at the regulatory authorities responsible_0.057 for the investment community_0.061 and at the Department of Trade and Industry which allowed_-0.118 the company to trade ."
"aa3-fragment08","230","‘ I felt_-0.212 it was so safe_-0.312 , they were so professional , ’ said Mr Tyson ."
"aa3-fragment08","231","‘ I feel_-0.182 appalled by the way_-0.5 these professional guardians have treated us ."
"aa3-fragment08","232","If you were a gambling_0.206 man it would not affect you , it would just be lost_-0.057 ."
"aa3-fragment08","233","But this was not a gamble_0.121 . ’"
"aa3-fragment08","234","Like so many investors , Mr Tyson found_-0.182 himself having to go back to work to ease_-0.1 the financial strain_0.147 he had hoped to avoid_-0.171 ."
"aa3-fragment08","235","Ironically , it was the Government which he partly blamed for the affair that gave_-0.485 him the chance to return_-0.2 to work after retirement ."
"aa3-fragment08","236","A change in the tax rules affecting pensions was shortly followed_-0.062 by a job with the Department of Environment 's Property Services Agency , a post which carries him through to March and may see_-0.406 him stay_-0.206 until he is 70 ."
"aa3-fragment08","237","Putting_-0.182 it as politely as he can , Mr Tyson said the whole_0.029 affair ‘ encouraged_0.121 ’ him to return_-0.235 to paid employment ."
"aa3-fragment08","238","‘ I had n't planned_-0.086 to work at all . ’"
"aa3-fragment08","239","And like all of the other investors , he and his wife were in a quandry ."
"aa3-fragment08","240","They wanted to do something but felt_-0.394 powerless ."
"aa3-fragment08","241","Pursuing_0.355 legal action would have cost them money they did n't have ( unless it meant_-0.091 selling their house which was not an option ) but doing nothing left_-0.182 them with the feeling_-0.059 that justice was n't being done ."
"aa3-fragment08","242","So they compromised and gave £100 to the Barlow Clowes Investors Group which was formed_0 last July to represent_0 the investors ' interests and co-ordinate_0.219 the fight_0.333 for compensation ."
"aa3-fragment08","243","That , says Mr Tyson , has been their only blessing_-0.061 ."
"aa3-fragment08","244","‘ They are dedicated people who clearly know what they are talking_-0.364 about and have guided_0 us through it ."
"aa3-fragment08","245","Those people are victims_-0.161 , too , but they have certainly kept_-0.152 us together_-0.29 . ’"
"aa3-fragment08","246","That aside_0.031 , the last year has brought_0.059 little respite from their own , very personal , crisis_0.088 ."
"aa3-fragment08","247","The Tysons have yet to see any cash payment from the liquidators who have been winding_0.206 up BCI 's affairs ."
"aa3-fragment08","248","What little money has been recovered remains the subject_0.194 of a legal tussle_0.471 in the courts which may yet take_-0.394 months to resolve ."
"aa3-fragment08","249","They have been told that their claim may only amount to around_-0.486 £11,000 of their £15,000 as capital gains tax is likely to be deducted from the total ."
"aa3-fragment08","250","But until they get any money back , the Tysons find_-0.242 themselves in the position_-0.182 of the gambler_0.235 who gambled_0.235 all and lost_-0.176 ."
"aa3-fragment08","251","Except that the Tysons do n't gamble_0.094 ."
"ab9-fragment03","791","The boy and the dog skirted round opposite sides of the puddle , the boy , a light , tall fourteen-year-old , labouring_0.559 in wellington boots too large for him , and the dog , a three-year-old Labrador bitch , picking_0.091 her way reluctantly , with frequent pauses , as if her paws hurt ."
"ab9-fragment03","792","The boy , unlike the dog , knew that the mud did not go_-0.406 on for ever ; beyond the bridge , the disused railway embankment along which they were walking became built up , so that water ran_-0.562 off it ."
"ab9-fragment03","793","He pulled the dog close to him to let a mixed string_-0.065 of horses and Ponies go past , waving shyly to the lead rider , a pretty , capable girl an unbridgeable two years older than him ."
"ab9-fragment03","794","He watched her as she went past at a walk , the black Labrador and he both gazing wistfully , their breath steaming in the cold February morning ."
"ab9-fragment03","795","He waited till the horses were well away and looked round the wide , flat landscape carefully before unclipping the lead ."
"ab9-fragment03","796","‘ Way you go , Patty , ’ he said softly_0.152 , and the dog was off , hurling_0.625 herself along the embankment , all paws and flying_0.324 ears , after a rabbit who had been sitting_-0.412 in a patch_0.094 of sun but disappeared with contemptuous_0.514 ease as she came close ."
"ab9-fragment03","797","The boy had been told unequivocally not to let her off the lead — the riding-school only used_-0.031 the land by grace_0.088 of its owner and it was a shooting estate_0.485 — but he hated keeping the dog straining at the lead and knew that she would always come to his call ."
"ab9-fragment03","798","He stood for a moment laughing at her as she cast_0.143 furiously_0.182 for the vanished rabbit , and walked on , to catch_-0.294 her up , along the raised embankment ."
"ab9-fragment03","799","The trees had grown_-0.182 up beside it in the twenty-five years since the railway had closed_-0.294 , and the boy stopped every now_-0.412 and then_-0.438 to watch small birds hopping around the top branches ."
"ab9-fragment03","800","He particularly liked this stretch_0.235 ; nothing but the odd_0.188 tractor and the horses ever came down this embankment , and the birds were unworried by his presence ."
"ab9-fragment03","801","After half a mile he decided to turn off the embankment and walk up the side of the next field and along the path at the top of it , following the horses whom he could still see in the distance ."
"ab9-fragment03","802","He called Patty to him ."
"ab9-fragment03","803","She did n't come , which was surprising ; she was a docile creature and particularly devoted to him because he always took her for a walk when he was at the stables ."
"ab9-fragment03","804","He could hear her barking and looked down over the steep side of the embankment to the bottom of the trees ."
"ab9-fragment03","805","He called her again and again , but she would not stop barking at something he could not see ."
"ab9-fragment03","806","Probably a squirrel , he decided , and slithered_0.5 down the side of the embankment to join_-0.114 her , scolding as he went ."
"ab9-fragment03","807","Straightening up beside the dog , he looked where she was looking , and blinked ."
"ab9-fragment03","808","He saw a leg , uncomfortably wedged between sapling trees , swollen grotesquely , and gazed_0.323 at it , stupidly , wondering if it was plastic ."
"ab9-fragment03","809","As his eyes focused he realized he was looking at a hideously swollen human body , and just then , as the light_0 breeze shifted_0.061 , he caught_0.194 the stomach-turning_0.618 odour of decay ."
"ab9-fragment03","810","He was a sensible and capable boy , an eldest child , so he moved closer , trying not to breathe , and stood steadfastly looking until he was confident of what he had seen : a body , must be a girl because it was wearing a skirt , lying face down , head towards the bottom of the embankment as if she had dived off the top ."
"ab9-fragment03","811","He clipped the lead on to the dog with cold hands which would hardly function , and let her pull him up the slope as fast as he could make_-0.147 his legs move ."
"ab9-fragment03","812","He stopped on the embankment , shaking with cold and shock , to note_0.088 the spot_-0.062 , then fled along the tractor paths , the dog running with him , to the stables where the ten o'clock children 's ride was in its closing_-0.065 stages_-0.062 ."
"ab9-fragment03","813","‘ Miss Williams ! ’"
"ab9-fragment03","814","‘ Jamie , I 'm teaching . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","815","The thin , capable woman who was taking_-0.094 the riding-class looked at him in amazement as he leaned panting on the gate to the ring , the dog whining_0.229 beside him ."
"ab9-fragment03","816","‘ I 'm sorry ."
"ab9-fragment03","817","Please , I 've found something , I must tell you ."
"ab9-fragment03","818","She had known him since he was a very small five-year-old , perched_0.382 like a mosquito_0.412 on one of the placid beginners ' ponies , so she told the class to carry on walking their ponies while she came to him ."
"ab9-fragment03","819","‘ There 's someone dead ."
"ab9-fragment03","820","Below the railway embankment . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","821","‘ Are you sure ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","822","The boy looked at her and uncontrollable tears suddenly filled_-0.206 his eyes ."
"ab9-fragment03","823","He was very nearly as tall as her , but she put an arm under his shoulders and supported him to the untidy room which served_0.294 as the stable office , calling to one of the stable girls to take over the class ."
"ab9-fragment03","824","‘ Patty found her ."
"ab9-fragment03","825","She 's just lying there , but she is dead . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","826","He scrubbed at his face with the handkerchief she offered and gulped_0.324 for air ."
"ab9-fragment03","827","‘ I 'll ring the police . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","828","She did so , casting_0.143 an experienced eye over him ."
"ab9-fragment03","829","‘ Sit down here , Jamie , and I 'll make some tea ."
"ab9-fragment03","830","Mummy will come back in a few minutes , wo n't she , for Susie ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","831","‘ Not Mummy ."
"ab9-fragment03","832","Aunt Margaret is coming at ten . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","833","The boy thought longingly of his mother , but managed to help Miss Williams describe the location of the body to a startled local station sergeant_0.375 and to drink a cup of sweet milky tea without being sick ."
"ab9-fragment03","834","By the time his aunt arrived Jamie was so far_-0.382 recovered as to be able to refuse to go home and to point_-0.176 out , severely , that he would be needed , either to assist the police or to be lead rider in the eleven-thirty class , or possibly both ."
"ab9-fragment03","835","He watched his aunt and Miss Williams wordlessly consult each other , but knew his aunt would do as she was told ; successful solicitor_0.485 though she was , she was ten years younger than Miss Williams and , as she complained , totally intimidated by her as she had not been by anyone since her late headmistress ."
"ab9-fragment03","836","He was unsurprised to find her packed off firmly_0 to take his sister home , leaving him as a person of major importance in what he instantly assumed_-0.118 to be a real murder ."
"ab9-fragment03","837","Miss Williams took him to meet the police Land Rover at the stable gate , a bone-thin , wiry_0.471 woman in her late fifties , her expression sufficiently forbidding to prevent the parents , edging_0.412 cars through the gate to collect_-0.029 children from the ten o'clock ride , from asking any questions ."
"ab9-fragment03","838","Jamie , through a renewed queasiness_0.469 , just observed that the police driver was instantly reduced to half his age by Miss Williams 's greeting ."
"ab9-fragment03","839","‘ He was one of my boys , ’ she said in explanation to the CID sergeant_0.235 who was leading_0.088 the party as they bumped over the rough road , through the thick mud and on to the dry embankment ."
"ab9-fragment03","840","‘ Like Jamie here . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","841","‘ Did you recognize the person you found , young man ? ’ the sergeant_0.3 asked , carefully ."
"ab9-fragment03","842","‘ No . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","843","Tears started into Jamie 's eyes ."
"ab9-fragment03","844","‘ She was all swollen . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","845","The sergeant_0.059 's eyes widened , and he slid out of the Land Rover and stood back to let Jamie out ."
"ab9-fragment03","846","‘ Very competent boy ."
"ab9-fragment03","847","Almost a professional singer , handles_0.176 himself very well . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","848","Miss Williams 's natural pitch , well suited to reaching_0.235 across a hunting-field , was discreetly reduced_0.083 ."
"ab9-fragment03","849","The CID sergeant_0.471 thanked her gravely and went to stand beside Jamie who was peering down the embankment , looking pinched ."
"ab9-fragment03","850","‘ We 'll go down together , lad . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","851","‘ There is n't room ."
"ab9-fragment03","852","I 'll lead . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","853","He took_-0.455 a deep_-0.031 breath and headed down , the sergeant_0.152 , two constables and Miss Williams in his wake_-0.061 ."
"ab9-fragment03","854","Soon they all stood side by side , one of the younger policemen coughing involuntarily ."
"ab9-fragment03","855","‘ Oh dear , oh dear , ’ Miss Williams said on an indrawn breath ."
"ab9-fragment03","856","‘ Sorry ."
"ab9-fragment03","857","Come along , Jamie , let's get you back . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","858","She took out a handkerchief and mopped_0.303 her eyes ."
"ab9-fragment03","859","The police driver shot_-0.065 Jamie a look of enquiry which he missed_-0.065 , occupied_0 as he was with guiding Miss Williams back_-0.371 up the hill ."
"ab9-fragment03","860","He had seen her weep before but only for a sick horse , and he was awe-struck ."
"ab9-fragment03","861","‘ Jamie , did you let Patty off the lead ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","862","The boy blushed to his ears and owned to it ."
"ab9-fragment03","863","‘ You must not do it , Jamie , we 'll be in trouble with Colonel James , I 've told all you boys a thousand times . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","864","‘ He 'll perhaps not do it again , ’ the sergeant_0.206 murmured , and received the look that Miss Williams habitually bent_0.406 on a child who was riding carelessly ."
"ab9-fragment03","865","‘ How long_-0.147 had she been there ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","866","Jamie asked , anxiously ."
"ab9-fragment03","867","‘ A few days , ’ the sergeant_0.406 said , grimly ."
"ab9-fragment03","868","‘ How many ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","869","‘ Doctor 'll tell us . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","870","He considered the boy thoughtfully , and decided to take him back quickly ."
"ab9-fragment03","871","These teenagers were in his experience a lot less tough_-0.273 than they looked ."
"ab9-fragment03","872","‘ Any idea who it could be ? ’ he asked Miss Williams casually ."
"ab9-fragment03","873","‘ No ."
"ab9-fragment03","874","But only a local would know to put a body there ."
"ab9-fragment03","875","If Jamie had n't let the dog off the lead she could have been there much longer . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","876","The sergeant_0.265 nodded , deciding it could do no harm to concede_0.125 a point_0.031 he had already taken_-0.286 ."
"ab9-fragment03","877","‘ No one could tell_-0.286 who she was , surely ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","878","Miss Williams said quietly to him , sounding shaky ."
"ab9-fragment03","879","‘ She did n't even look human . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","880","The sergeant_0.062 confirmed_-0.086 that that happened with bodies after a few days ."
"ab9-fragment03","881","‘ We 'll identify her , though , ’ he said , reassuringly ."
"ab9-fragment03","882","‘ Somebody will likely have reported her missing . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","883","He stopped , abruptly , as he remembered a conversation earlier that week , and lit_-0.206 a cigarette , thinking furiously_0.065 ."
"ab9-fragment03","884","This could be the girl whom the Yard were looking for , and he had better do everything very quickly indeed , including finding his Chief , who would then want to find his Chief Constable and notify Scotland Yard ."
"ab9-fragment03","885","Presumably it would be the Yard who investigated this one , rather than the regional crime squad_0.129 ."
"ab9-fragment03","886","He chewed his thumbnail as he walked , out of long_-0.242 experience keeping_-0.182 in mind the highest_-0.125 priorities : Ensure Body Not Moved and Ensure Next of Kin Notified before the Press got_-0.438 the story ."
"ab9-fragment03","887","He posted the detective constable he had with him back down the path to join_-0.029 his colleague , armed_-0.118 with instructions to repel_0.219 all attempts by anyone , however senior_0.212 or armed_0.118 with whatever authority , to go anywhere near the body unless he , Sergeant Black , personally accompanied them ."
"ab9-fragment03","888","Then he climbed into the Land Rover beside his two passengers and drove off fast , with the aim_-0.061 of abandoning Jamie to the custody of his aunt as quickly_-0.029 as possible ."
"ab9-fragment03","889","He could see with half an eye that the kid 's aunt was going to be one of the confident , bossy , well-connected_0.257 women with whom that part of Cambridgeshire was substantially_0.229 over-provided_0.121 ."
"ab9-fragment03","890","John McLeish was in his office , Saturday or no Saturday , telling himself he needed to catch_0.152 up on the paperwork ."
"ab9-fragment03","891","The phone rang and he picked it up , frowning ."
"ab9-fragment03","892","One of the pleasures of Saturday working was that the phone did not ring all the time ."
"ab9-fragment03","893","The voice at the other end was plainly over-excited and it took_-0.161 him a minute to disentangle_0.516 what he was being told ."
"ab9-fragment03","894","‘ Oh congratulations , Charlie ."
"ab9-fragment03","895","Sorry , what did you say it was again ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","896","‘ A little girl ."
"ab9-fragment03","897","Actually a very big girl as these things_-0.273 go_-0.324 , nine pounds ."
"ab9-fragment03","898","It 's fantastic_0.125 , John , there she is , a new person , lying on her face , sound asleep ."
"ab9-fragment03","899","I 've just left them and I 'm going back . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","900","McLeish repressed the malicious thought that this event might put Francesca 's nose_-0.143 just a little bit out of joint_0.029 ."
"ab9-fragment03","901","She had been utterly secure in her position_-0.152 as the only girl in the Wilson family and now there was another one ."
"ab9-fragment03","902","‘ I 've got another bit_-0.031 of good news ."
"ab9-fragment03","903","Frannie 's going to be able to bring Tristram home pretty soon , apparently . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","904","McLeish expressed qualified_0.176 enthusiasm and Charlie assured him he felt_-0.235 exactly the same about his younger brother ."
"ab9-fragment03","905","‘ The difficulty is that Perry does everything that bit_-0.118 better than Tristram ."
"ab9-fragment03","906","Not that this is any excuse , John , I do know . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","907","He paused , reminding_0.176 McLeish irresistibly_0.094 of a Labrador_0.545 wondering_0 how best to approach_0 an acquaintance_0.438 ."
"ab9-fragment03","908","‘ I wanted to say , you see_-0.286 , that I know you thought Frannie should n't have gone , and that it 's ruined your holiday plans_-0.118 , and , on behalf of us all , I 'm sorry ."
"ab9-fragment03","909","I know the little boys lean_-0.031 on her too much and I would have gone if I could . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","910","He coughed , embarrassed and a little pompous , very much conscious of his new status as a father , while McLeish remembered that he was a scant four years older than the delinquent Tristram ."
"ab9-fragment03","911","‘ Anyway she should be back soon , ’ Charlie concluded ."
"ab9-fragment03","912","McLeish thanked him gravely , feeling_-0.118 , as he often did with the Wilsons , that he was being enveloped_0.576 in a large feather eiderdown_0.588 , and , made_-0.515 restless by the call_-0.03 , went down the corridor to where he knew Catherine Crane was also in , getting_-0.29 her office in order_0.094 ."
"ab9-fragment03","913","He stopped at the door and smiled at her ."
"ab9-fragment03","914","Wearing jeans and a blue shirt , she was tugging at a filing cabinet which was too large for her to embrace_0.059 and which was threatening_0.212 to over-balance_0.273 on her ."
"ab9-fragment03","915","She looked about sixteen and beautiful ."
"ab9-fragment03","916","She let_-0.486 go_-0.303 of the cabinet , coughing in the dust of ages that appeared_-0.028 to be lurking_0.529 behind it , and smiled back at him as the February sun shone through the small window behind her , throwing_0.176 into sharp_0.061 relief_0.086 the patches_0.324 on the wall where her predecessor had hung posters , and the ingrained dirt on the flaking paintwork round the mean_0.057 , narrow , metal window ."
"ab9-fragment03","917","‘ Where do you want that put ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","918","McLeish advanced on the cabinet and shifted it authoritatively , ignoring the clip_0.057 on the ankle_-0.114 dealt him by an unsecured bottom drawer apparently full of bricks ."
"ab9-fragment03","919","‘ I should have unloaded it first , ’ Catherine Crane said , apologetically , ‘ but I just could n't move in any direction with it where it was . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","920","‘ I 'm here , just tell me if you want anything else shifted . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","921","He hesitated ."
"ab9-fragment03","922","‘ I 'm going to do another hour , then have some lunch , if you want to come ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","923","He was aware that he was not managing_0 to sound exactly like a senior officer making a recent arrival feel_-0.364 at home_-0.441 , but decided not to add_-0.394 any further_0.032 riders_0.147 to his invitation ."
"ab9-fragment03","924","‘ That would be very nice ."
"ab9-fragment03","925","Are we going to the canteen ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","926","‘ Not if I can help it ."
"ab9-fragment03","927","What about the pub ?"
"ab9-fragment03","928","‘ If I 'm allowed to buy my own . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","929","McLeish considered ."
"ab9-fragment03","930","‘ That 's fine on the food — I 'll buy the drinks , I 'm too old to get used to women buying my drinks . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","931","She laughed at him and said gravely that she would be happy to indulge him , and he went away , grinning ."
"ab9-fragment03","932","Peter Yeo was also in his office , having told his wife he was lunching with a client ."
"ab9-fragment03","933","It was , he felt_-0.029 , just too difficult to be at home at all , with Claudia in a permanently bitchy mood and both his teenage children taking_-0.188 their cue_0.152 from her and behaving intolerably ."
"ab9-fragment03","934","He wandered restlessly about , and decided that the lie might as well become_-0.353 the truth ."
"ab9-fragment03","935","Without Angela Morgan , at least two major clients were in danger of not getting_-0.343 the assiduous_0.576 service they were paying for , and it would be well_-0.226 worth trying to see_-0.469 if one of them , whom he knew to be a fellow refugee_0.212 from family life at the weekends , could be found ."
"ab9-fragment03","936","He was in luck , and fixed_0.412 to meet Andy Barton at Brazzo 's where Yeo Davis had a table permanently booked_0.088 ."
"ab9-fragment03","937","He had to admit_-0.188 that this particular client hardly added_0.029 to the general decorative smartness_0.5 of the place ."
"ab9-fragment03","938","Andy Barton , founder and chief executive of Barton Textiles , was almost as broad as he was long , virtually neckless , with incongruously long brown hair curling over his collar ."
"ab9-fragment03","939","His enormous hands dwarfed the elegant menu which he was studying in apparent disbelief , and Peter Yeo noticed again , as Barton without rising extended one massive paw_0.273 , that though the fingers were an ordinary length it was the width of the palms that made_-0.516 the hands so large ."
"ab9-fragment03","940","‘ I never see_-0.353 how they get_-0.265 the sales per square foot_-0.152 in these places , ’ Barton observed_-0.121 , without further greeting ."
"ab9-fragment03","941","‘ I mean , they 're not open_-0.485 twelve hours like my shops , and they are n't using_0.031 the space . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","942","His small bright_0.03 blue eyes swept_0.031 disparagingly over the minimalized black and white flooring , stainless steel chairs and black wooden bar ."
"ab9-fragment03","943","‘ They make_-0.286 a huge_-0.242 margin_0.143 on a smaller_-0.088 turnover_0.394 , Andy , out of punters_0.412 like us . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","944","Peter Yeo was amused by , and respectful of , a man with an obsession ."
"ab9-fragment03","945","‘ Angela not working today ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","946","Barton worked a sixteen-hour day , which began_-0.273 with careful_-0.062 , detailed consideration of the trading figures and key ratios_0.176 for every one of his forty-three major shops and the output_0.29 of both factories , and continued , usually by helicopter , with a detailed aerial survey of a particular area as the quick_0.057 way_-0.273 of identifying_-0.03 new sites , interspersed_0.375 with unheralded descents_-0.029 on the manager of any shop he took_0.03 a fancy_0.056 to visit ."
"ab9-fragment03","947","Peter Yeo , who had known this particular juggernaut_0.647 since he had his first small factory and two stores_0.031 and dirt under his fingernails from shifting packing-cases personally , was not fazed by the question ."
"ab9-fragment03","948","‘ Angela 's taking_-0.441 a few days off — she has n't been well , ’ he said , easily_-0.086 ."
"ab9-fragment03","949","‘ I know she 's been working very hard_-0.382 for you ."
"ab9-fragment03","950","I 'm up to speed_0.353 with Huerter , of course , but is your planning_0.059 application_0.182 in Leicester all right ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","951","Barton assured him warmly_0.2 that Angela had done a great_-0.242 job_-0.229 and he was now_-0.469 confident of getting_-0.032 planning_0.219 permission on the vast site he had wanted ."
"ab9-fragment03","952","Peter Yeo , who knew him in this over-candid_-0.059 , over-emphatic_0.029 mood , decided to prod_0.294 gently ."
"ab9-fragment03","953","‘ Angela said the council wanted it for housing ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","954","‘ Yeah , some of them did ."
"ab9-fragment03","955","Silly buggers , it 's jobs they want there_-0.226 first ."
"ab9-fragment03","956","Plenty of housing if those stupid farts_0.312 at the council got round to repairing it and stopped_-0.176 their tenants tearing apart what they have got ."
"ab9-fragment03","957","My Mum brought up five of us in a flat far_-0.324 worse than what these immigrants complain about . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","958","Peter Yeo , who had personally persuaded Barton of the presentational_0.303 disadvantage of using words like ‘ darkies ’ , ‘ niggers ’ or ‘ wogs ’ , decided that ‘ immigrants ’ even though used in the manner of one invoking_0.25 a curse_0.378 , was as good as he was going to get_-0.235 with this particular client ."
"ab9-fragment03","959","‘ She 's doing a good job_-0.212 on sorting_0.353 this Huerter thing_-0.176 , too ."
"ab9-fragment03","960","Bloody_0.353 ridiculous them blokes at the DTI pushing_0.182 assistance for Huerter ."
"ab9-fragment03","961","I voted for this government because they said they were n't going to go in for that sort of rubbish_0.424 ."
"ab9-fragment03","962","No one ever gave me anything and my business works_-0.059 ."
"ab9-fragment03","963","Still , Angie can fix_0.03 the Treasury on this one , given her boyfriend , ca n't she ?"
"ab9-fragment03","964","That 's the reason I wanted you on this . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","965","Peter Yeo winced_0.382 inwardly , but he was not going to tell Andy Barton that Angela was missing , or express_0.121 any of his reservations_0.086 about how much influence_0.412 Angela could bring_-0.094 to bear_0.029 ."
"ab9-fragment03","966","He smoothly_0.061 changed_-0.188 the subject_0.194 to the looks_-0.229 of the blond model_-0.088 , three tables away , and Barton agreed he would n't mind a bit_-0.441 of that ; on the thin_0.029 side_0 , mind_0.088 you , but tasty_0.265 ."
"ab9-fragment03","967","The rest_-0.235 of lunch passed_0.091 in similar diversion_0.355 , interspersed_0.333 with details of last week 's turnover_0.379 which were never far_-0.091 from Barton 's mind , whatever other distractions_0.188 offered_-0.212 ."
"ab9-fragment03","968","Mrs Huntley was having lunch with her daughter ."
"ab9-fragment03","969","She ate placidly , acknowledging to herself with her customary good sense_-0.265 that at the moment , as at any time since her brother William had died , she and Penelope were getting_-0.182 no pleasure at all from each other 's company ."
"ab9-fragment03","970","Penelope was looking particularly discontented and disaffected_0.25 , picking at her food ."
"ab9-fragment03","971","Her red suit was smart_-0.212 , but too bright_-0.029 a colour for her pale English pink and white skin , her brown hair could have done with a wash and her nails were ragged and bitten ."
"ab9-fragment03","972","She was frowning , deep lines_0 appearing_0.031 between her eyebrows , mouth drawn_0.091 down at the edges so that instead of a classically good-looking slim English Rose_0.375 in her late twenties , she looked faded_0.394 , years older than her real age , and shrewish ."
"ab9-fragment03","973","Mrs Huntley sighed ; her brother whom she had loved , but knew to be self-indulgent to a fault_0.176 , had done his niece real harm_-0.065 by leaving_-0.147 so much of his money away from the girl who had confidently believed herself to be his favourite thing_-0.206 on earth ."
"ab9-fragment03","974","Penelope , however , it had to be acknowledged , had made_-0.361 no attempt to rise_-0.118 above the blow_0.143 she had been dealt_-0.125 by finding a dazzling_0.441 girl of her own age favoured over herself in her uncle 's will_-0.147 ."
"ab9-fragment03","975","At least , Mrs Huntley thought hopefully , she had stopped_-0.212 wondering , unbecomingly_0.484 and stridently_0.516 , how her uncle could have been fooled_0.167 by Angela Morgan ."
"ab9-fragment03","976","It was Grizel Huntley 's own view_-0.147 that her brother had not been fooled_0.233 at all but had been charmed_0.364 and diverted_0.455 by a dashing girl thirty years his junior , and had seen_-0.281 no reason at all why she should not have a share_-0.143 of his considerable_0.265 estate_0.091 when that left_-0.061 a very decent_0.286 down-setting_0.484 for his niece as well ."
"ab9-fragment03","977","Indeed , she had respected Angela Morgan for the straightforwardness_0.364 with which she had tackled_0.206 the issue when they had met at the lawyer 's office ."
"ab9-fragment03","978","‘ I 'm sorry you 're disappointed , ’ she had said to Penelope , ‘ but after all there 's a lot_-0.206 of money , quite enough for both of us . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","979","So there was , Grizel Huntley acknowledged , and it would be a great deal better if Penny could manage_0.188 to think a bit more positively ."
"ab9-fragment03","980","‘ If she has vanished , I 'm going to see_-0.469 that solicitor about whether I can get_-0.258 her presumed dead . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","981","Penny , sounding childishly , sullenly determined_0.469 , broke_-0.147 into her mother 's thoughts ."
"ab9-fragment03","982","Grizel Huntley looked across_-0.091 at her , shocked_0.061 ."
"ab9-fragment03","983","‘ I would wait a little if I were you . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","984","Penelope glared_0.188 at her , turning an ungraceful_0.529 scarlet , but Mrs Huntley held_-0.212 her ground_0 ."
"ab9-fragment03","985","‘ You are being silly about this , Penny ."
"ab9-fragment03","986","You are letting_-0.161 this disappointment — and that 's all it is , you 're still a very well-off young woman — get_-0.686 in the way_-0.312 of everything . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","987","Penelope choked on her pudding and started to cry , angry_-0.059 , uncontrollable tears ."
"ab9-fragment03","988","Grizel Huntley reached out to comfort_0.091 her but she forced back her chair and fled_0.182 , clutching her handbag and napkin , leaving her mother with the ruins_0.242 of lunch ."
"ab9-fragment03","989","Fifty miles north , Sarah Morgan had just finished serving a lunch that no one had done more than pick at ."
"ab9-fragment03","990","Her husband Francis had made a slightly better showing_-0.062 than her daughter Jennifer , who was looking particularly ragged_0.5 ."
"ab9-fragment03","991","Mother and daughter were very like each other , tall , dark_-0.161 , slim , pleasant-looking women with mid-brown curly hair and slightly snub noses ."
"ab9-fragment03","992","Francis Morgan , by contrast_-0.226 , was dark , almost black-haired , sallow-skinned , with bright_-0.206 brown eyes ."
"ab9-fragment03","993","Of medium height and packed_0.286 with energy , even distressed as he was , he was bursting_0.235 round the kitchen , hair still damp at the back from his swim ."
"ab9-fragment03","994","‘ Let's go to the flicks ."
"ab9-fragment03","995","No point_-0.29 at all sitting round looking at each other ."
"ab9-fragment03","996","Come_-0.29 on Jennifer — or are you going out with Michael ? ’"
"ab9-fragment03","997","‘ He 's gone back to Australia , Dad ."
"ab9-fragment03","998","Last week . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","999","Jennifer sounded defeated_-0.091 , and he looked at her sideways with familiar love and exasperation ."
"ab9-fragment03","1000","She just did n't seem to be able to hang on to men , he thought impatiently , not like his Angie , wherever she was ."
"ab9-fragment03","1001","‘ Giles rang up , ’ his daughter volunteered_0.129 , and he was uncomfortably_0.242 reminded by something in her voice that Giles Hawick was one of the men Jennifer had n't been able to hang on to — or not once he had seen Angela ."
"ab9-fragment03","1002","‘ How was he ? ’ his wife Sarah asked , rather too quickly ."
"ab9-fragment03","1003","‘ Well_-0.133 , very worried ."
"ab9-fragment03","1004","He said the police were talking to everyone Angie had seen in the two weeks before she … well … vanished , and so far_-0.25 had come up with nothing ."
"ab9-fragment03","1005","I mean no one noticed anything unusual about her and she seemed to be full_0.059 of plans_-0.412 for the wedding . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","1006","‘ Well_-0.543 , I told them that , ’ Francis Morgan said irritably and his wife and daughter caught_-0.226 each other 's eye_-0.212 in silent agreement that he had n't told them that Angela was refusing point-black_0.156 to be married from home and was insisting on the full_0 London set-out_0.091 , reception_0.206 at the House of Commons , replying unanswerably when he had objected on grounds_0.061 of expense that she could well afford to pay for it herself ."
"ab9-fragment03","1007","A row of epic_0.091 proportions_0.212 had ensued , which he and Angela had evidently enjoyed but which had left_-0.324 Sarah and Jennifer sick_0.176 with distress ."
"ab9-fragment03","1008","‘ I do n't want to go out , Frank ."
"ab9-fragment03","1009","Someone might ring_-0.229 . ’"
"ab9-fragment03","1010","Sarah Morgan was sounding diffident but resolute , and as Morgan opened his mouth to protest in exasperation the doorbell rang ."
"ab9-fragment03","1011","Both women looked at him in joint appeal_0.086 and he marched_0.062 to the door , pulling it open with unnecessary force ."
"ab9-fragment03","1012","He stood , door in hand , checked_0.091 by something in the way_-0.176 his visitors , a man and a woman , were standing ."
"ab9-fragment03","1013","The man , a stocky , greying fifty-year-old in a navy raincoat over a suit , his hair cut short , was attended by a uniformed policewoman , hair smartly_0.455 set under the cap , her eyes watchful_0.382 in the wide , flat , placid face , and both of them were standing square_0.265 and stolid_0.344 ."
"ab9-fragment03","1014","Francis Morgan stood and stared at them , and even before the man stepped forward steadily , hand extended , mouth opening to speak , he understood who they were and what they had come to tell him ."
"ac2-fragment06","1251","Mark Sanders returned from Istanbul feeling_-0.344 exhausted_0.156 , depressed and ill ."
"ac2-fragment06","1252","The blinding_0.364 headaches he had been experiencing in recent weeks were taking_-0.121 their toll_0.121 , and he looked grey_0.121 and drawn when he arrived home ."
"ac2-fragment06","1253","Lately , Georgina had been worried by the general deterioration in his appearance ."
"ac2-fragment06","1254","But now she was visibly shocked_-0.167 by the drained and haggard-looking face which kissed_-0.065 her ."
"ac2-fragment06","1255","She wanted to say , ‘ You look awful , darling , ’ but decided against it ."
"ac2-fragment06","1256","‘ What kind of a trip have you had ? ’ she asked instead ."
"ac2-fragment06","1257","‘ Oh , not too bad , ’ he replied wearily ."
"ac2-fragment06","1258","She took his suitcase and placed it at the bottom of the stairs ."
"ac2-fragment06","1259","‘ Come into the kitchen , and we will have a cup of tea ."
"ac2-fragment06","1260","I 've so much news to tell you ."
"ac2-fragment06","1261","All sorts of things_-0.303 seem to have happened while you have been away this time . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1262","Mark smiled thinly_0.212 and kissed her affectionately on the cheek ."
"ac2-fragment06","1263","‘ Tell me about it , ’ he replied ."
"ac2-fragment06","1264","‘ I could do with a good laugh . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1265","‘ Why darling ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1266","What 's the matter ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1267","Trouble at t'mill ? ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1268","Mark slipped an arm around her slim waist as they walked from the hall into the kitchen ."
"ac2-fragment06","1269","‘ Perhaps it 's old Montezuma 's revenge , ’ he replied ."
"ac2-fragment06","1270","‘ Must be getting_-0.062 too old for this globe-trotting lark_0.281 , or else my mis-spent_0.265 youth is catching_-0.088 up on me ."
"ac2-fragment06","1271","I 'm rapidly coming_-0.161 to the conclusion that this is a young man 's game_0 . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1272","‘ Nonsense , Mark ."
"ac2-fragment06","1273","You 're still a young man … well , youngish. ’ she said , trying to tease_0.03 him out of his apparent lethargy and depression_0.333 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1274","‘ Let's have that cup of tea and you 'll feel_-0.469 better . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1275","‘ Ah , fill the cup , what boots_0.188 it to repeat , how time is slipping_0.194 underneath our feet , ’ he quoted with a sigh ."
"ac2-fragment06","1276","‘ Oh darling ."
"ac2-fragment06","1277","What a sad_-0.4 sack_-0.029 we are today ."
"ac2-fragment06","1278","Is that how you feel_-0.353 ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1279","Shall I accompany_0.344 you on the violin ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1280","Now let me tell you all the news . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1281","She poured the tea ."
"ac2-fragment06","1282","‘ Christopher has been promoted after only one year ."
"ac2-fragment06","1283","The Chairman of the company told him he was most impressed with the contribution_0.032 he 's made_-0.303 to the business , and that he could go_-0.441 right to the top_-0.286 if he keeps_-0.469 it up ."
"ac2-fragment06","1284","I knew you 'd be delighted to hear that . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1285","She sipped her tea ."
"ac2-fragment06","1286","‘ Next …"
"ac2-fragment06","1287","I 've found a super husband for Harriet ."
"ac2-fragment06","1288","Champion_0.515 of the breed at Crufts last year ."
"ac2-fragment06","1289","Lives in the next village , believe it or not ."
"ac2-fragment06","1290","Absolutely magnificent dog . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1291","‘ Lucky Harriet , ’ said Mark ."
"ac2-fragment06","1292","‘ What else ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1293","Ah yes ; a Secretary at the Ministry of Industry wants you to ring him ."
"ac2-fragment06","1294","Seems they want you to address_-0.061 the European Commission on European industrial development ."
"ac2-fragment06","1295","In Dublin , I think she said ."
"ac2-fragment06","1296","Something about the factors which influence multi-nat location decisions ."
"ac2-fragment06","1297","Anyway , you 'll know what it means_-0.344 when you see it ."
"ac2-fragment06","1298","I 've written it all down ."
"ac2-fragment06","1299","Oh and yes … a chap from Conservative Central_0.125 Office rang up to say they 'd like to know if you would be prepared_0.182 to stand_-0.088 for the European Parliament ."
"ac2-fragment06","1300","He sounded somewhat to the right_0.062 of Genghis Khan ."
"ac2-fragment06","1301","I said I did n't think so , as you were rather busy , but I 'd pass_-0.091 the message on ."
"ac2-fragment06","1302","Hope I did the right thing_-0.212 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1303","I said you never knew where you were from one week to the next ."
"ac2-fragment06","1304","He said that would do nicely ."
"ac2-fragment06","1305","Just like the American Express advertisement ."
"ac2-fragment06","1306","Perfect credentials apparently , for European parliamentarians ."
"ac2-fragment06","1307","‘ Now what next ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1308","The Chicheley-Smythes have bought an absolutely super villa in Sardinia and say we could rent it if we 'd like to ."
"ac2-fragment06","1309","I 've seen the photographs ."
"ac2-fragment06","1310","Gorgeous location overlooking_0.059 a quiet_-0.242 bay ."
"ac2-fragment06","1311","It sleeps ten with a permanent staff of three ."
"ac2-fragment06","1312","Only a thousand pounds a week , yacht included_0 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1313","I 'd love that for two or three weeks , would n't you ? ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1314","‘ We would n't want to stint ourselves , ’ Mark said facetiously , ‘ four or five , I should think … . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1315","‘ And we could take the family , ’ she said ."
"ac2-fragment06","1316","‘ We have n't had a family holiday for years ."
"ac2-fragment06","1317","I 'd like that ."
"ac2-fragment06","1318","But we can talk about that later ."
"ac2-fragment06","1319","And I 've decided to take_-0.441 up riding again ."
"ac2-fragment06","1320","Do n't ask me why ."
"ac2-fragment06","1321","Just got_-0.647 the urge , that 's all . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1322","She gave_-0.353 him a beautiful smile , which lit_0.226 her lovely face ."
"ac2-fragment06","1323","‘ Well , how 's that for starters_-0.118 ? ’ she asked ."
"ac2-fragment06","1324","He had heard that expression before_-0.156 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1325","‘ Is there more ? ,"
"ac2-fragment06","1326","‘ Now let me see_-0.515 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1327","Ah , yes …"
"ac2-fragment06","1328","Andrew 's coming home for the weekend so I thought it would be nice to have a drinks party ."
"ac2-fragment06","1329","I 've invited the Bunkers , if that 's all right ."
"ac2-fragment06","1330","I like Clem and Gwen and the girls would be nicer company for Andrew . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1331","‘ Fine , ’ agreed Mark without much enthusiasm ."
"ac2-fragment06","1332","‘ If Clem can make_-0.226 it , that is ."
"ac2-fragment06","1333","I heard about this latest Merseyside strike_0.03 in Istanbul ."
"ac2-fragment06","1334","Could finish_0.281 off the UK vehicle division , ’ he said forlornly , ‘ and Don Peters , ’ he added_-0.229 , shaking his head ."
"ac2-fragment06","1335","Some of the stupid bastards wo n't be satisfied until we no longer make a single vehicle in the UK ."
"ac2-fragment06","1336","Then I suppose they 'll say it 's all management 's fault , and people will believe them ."
"ac2-fragment06","1337","And who the hell IS management ? ’ he demanded , his voice rising_0.182 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1338","‘ People like me , who 've worked their guts_0.2 out to expand_0.094 the business while the militant bastards_0.485 have been working their guts_0.343 out to destroy_0.121 it . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1339","Georgina was nodding agreement ."
"ac2-fragment06","1340","She patted his wrist ."
"ac2-fragment06","1341","‘ I 'm quite sure you 're right , dear ."
"ac2-fragment06","1342","But we were n't talking about the motor industry and the never-ending management-union saga_0.375 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1343","We were talking about Andrew coming home for the weekend and having the Bunkers round for drinks ."
"ac2-fragment06","1344","And I do wish you would n't swear like that when you talk about business ."
"ac2-fragment06","1345","You never used to swear , you know ."
"ac2-fragment06","1346","At least , you did n't when you were with me ."
"ac2-fragment06","1347","But you do now , darling , and I do wish you would n't ."
"ac2-fragment06","1348","You are becoming so hard_-0.235 and bitter_-0.029 and it 's not really like you . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1349","Mark sighed ."
"ac2-fragment06","1350","‘ I 'm sorry ."
"ac2-fragment06","1351","It 's just … . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1352","‘ It 's just that there really is trouble at t'mill , ’ she said quietly ."
"ac2-fragment06","1353","‘ That 's it , is n't it ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1354","You were n't going to tell me ."
"ac2-fragment06","1355","You were just going to worry about it alone ."
"ac2-fragment06","1356","You let me go_-0.324 rabitting on … ."
"ac2-fragment06","1357","He hugged her ; kissed her cheek ."
"ac2-fragment06","1358","‘ I 'm not sure yet that there really is something to worry about . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1359","‘ But you think there is . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1360","He nodded ."
"ac2-fragment06","1361","‘ I have a horrible feeling that UM is about to reorganise world-wide planning_0.212 operations_0.061 and , if that happens , it 's curtains_0.312 for the European organisation and for me . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1362","‘ Curtains ? ’ she said ."
"ac2-fragment06","1363","‘ What exactly would that mean_-0.156 ? ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1364","‘ Early retirement . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1365","‘ Mark , you 're not serious ! ,"
"ac2-fragment06","1366","‘ I think it could be on the cards_0.235 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1367","They could transfer me to Detroit , or somewhere ."
"ac2-fragment06","1368","I do n't know , but I do n't like the signs_-0.219 . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1369","‘ Oh , Mark , ’ she said ."
"ac2-fragment06","1370","‘ They would n't do that to you ."
"ac2-fragment06","1371","They just could n't ."
"ac2-fragment06","1372","Not after all you 've done for the Corporation ."
"ac2-fragment06","1373","They could n't be that unfair and ruthless . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1374","His expression was wry ."
"ac2-fragment06","1375","‘ My dear , they 'll do whatever they feel_-0.257 is necessary to do ."
"ac2-fragment06","1376","Sentiment , loyalty , service and track_0.03 record , none of these things_-0.257 will come_-0.235 into it . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1377","Georgina took him in her arms and kissed him on the lips ."
"ac2-fragment06","1378","‘ It 's all so ridiculous that we 're not going to even think about it any more , ’ she said firmly_-0.057 , hiding_-0.147 her fears ."
"ac2-fragment06","1379","‘ Now come into the garden , ’ she added_-0.314 , smiling ."
"ac2-fragment06","1380","‘ I want to show you the clematis ."
"ac2-fragment06","1381","It 's a mass_0.029 of colour . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1382","Lying in bed that evening , they talked a lot about their life together ."
"ac2-fragment06","1383","They recalled_0.121 their first days ."
"ac2-fragment06","1384","The county ball ."
"ac2-fragment06","1385","The Paul Jones and the emotional somersaults_0.438 when the music stopped_-0.059 and they came_-0.235 face to face for the very first time ."
"ac2-fragment06","1386","The wedding ."
"ac2-fragment06","1387","The birth of their first son , Adam , and then Christopher and Andrew ."
"ac2-fragment06","1388","The children growing up with all the laughter and tears ."
"ac2-fragment06","1389","Schooldays and the void_0.088 they both felt_-0.265 when the boys went off to boarding school , followed by the joy unconfined_0.531 when they came home at the end_-0.444 of term ."
"ac2-fragment06","1390","Mark 's promotions and progress up the company ladder_-0.031 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1391","New and changing homes ."
"ac2-fragment06","1392","Friends lost and friends gained_-0.25 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1393","Family achievements and disappointments ."
"ac2-fragment06","1394","Notwithstanding current problems which they discussed lightly_0.353 , it had all been wonderful ."
"ac2-fragment06","1395","They fell_-0.091 asleep in the early hours of the morning , holding hands ."
"ac2-fragment06","1396","The next day Mark arrived back at UM 's European headquarters_0.118 in London and received an early call from Muldoon ."
"ac2-fragment06","1397","He went down the airless corridor to his Boss 's office , said hello to the secretary , and walked into the large oak-panelled room which was as big as the lobby of many a sizeable hotel ."
"ac2-fragment06","1398","Muldoon rose immediately from his enormous black leather chair to greet him , coming from behind the vast desk with hand outstretched ."
"ac2-fragment06","1399","‘ Hello Mark ."
"ac2-fragment06","1400","Have a good trip ? ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1401","He took the Englishman by the arm and ushered him toward the easy chairs arranged around a long rectangular coffee table ."
"ac2-fragment06","1402","Instinctively , Mark felt_-0.312 uneasy ."
"ac2-fragment06","1403","Why the hand on the arm and the over-friendly_0.147 approach_0.375 ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1404","Muldoon never emerged from behind his desk to greet colleagues ."
"ac2-fragment06","1405","Only visitors and VIPs got_-0.156 that special reception_0.088 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1406","Muldoon poured the coffee ."
"ac2-fragment06","1407","‘ How did the Planning_-0.057 meeting go_-0.5 ? ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1408","Mark asked him ."
"ac2-fragment06","1409","‘ What was Nate 's reaction_-0.344 ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1410","Did he and the Committee go along with my proposals ? ’ he added_-0.061 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1411","‘ It went_-0.571 fine , ’ Muldoon said ."
"ac2-fragment06","1412","He seemed somewhat uneasy ."
"ac2-fragment06","1413","‘ Klepner did a good job_-0.4 . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1414","‘ How did he handle_-0.114 the questions ? ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1415","Mark asked ."
"ac2-fragment06","1416","‘ He does n't have the inside_-0.212 knowledge to deal_-0.242 with questions . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1417","‘ Oh , OK really ."
"ac2-fragment06","1418","I handled_-0.121 some and so did Mueller ."
"ac2-fragment06","1419","But Klepner did OK ."
"ac2-fragment06","1420","He did n't let_-0.312 the side_-0.333 down . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1421","Mark nodded ."
"ac2-fragment06","1422","‘ What was Mueller doing answering questions ."
"ac2-fragment06","1423","He was there to ASK them ."
"ac2-fragment06","1424","He does n't know the inside_-0.059 track_0.212 any more than Klepner . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1425","‘ Maybe not , but he soon will , ’ Muldoon replied quietly ."
"ac2-fragment06","1426","‘ And what does that mean_-0.242 ? ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1427","Muldoon seemed to be taking_-0.303 a long_-0.531 time over his coffee ."
"ac2-fragment06","1428","He evaded_0.265 Mark 's eyes ."
"ac2-fragment06","1429","‘ He 's goin' to head-up_0.206 world planning_0 operations from Detroit . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1430","‘ He 's already co-ordinating_0.303 the regional plans_-0.152 to provide a world picture_0.121 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1431","So what 's changed ? ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1432","Deep_-0.061 down he knew ."
"ac2-fragment06","1433","‘ He 's not going to just co-ordinate_-0.088 and consolidate any longer , ’ Muldoon said , with increasing_-0.314 nervousness ."
"ac2-fragment06","1434","‘ He 's gon na plan_-0.242 , direct_-0.094 and control worldwide planning_-0.176 operations from Detroit , including the regional planning_0.029 functions . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1435","Mark 's expression was one of faked_0.129 incredulity ."
"ac2-fragment06","1436","His gut_0.281 feelings had been right ."
"ac2-fragment06","1437","‘ You 've got to be joking ! ’ he scoffed ."
"ac2-fragment06","1438","‘ I know that 's what Mueller 's always wanted , but Nate and the Executive Committee would never fall_0 for that bloody_0.371 empire-building game_0 !"
"ac2-fragment06","1439","The regions are far_-0.303 too big and complex to be handled_0.176 from Detroit and even if they were foolish enough to believe that they could do it more effectively — which they ca n't — they would be crazy to try . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1440","‘ I know , Mark , I know , ’ Muldoon said ."
"ac2-fragment06","1441","‘ But that 's what they 're gon na do . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1442","‘ It will boomerang , ’ the Englishman said heatedly_0.343 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1443","‘ Overseas Governments and local nationals just wo n't stand_-0.125 for it , particularly when they get_-0.543 to know_-0.273 what 's going_0.152 on ."
"ac2-fragment06","1444","That 's one corporate_0.152 plan_-0.5 that ca n't win_-0.161 , not in the long_-0.212 term ."
"ac2-fragment06","1445","‘ I know , Mark ."
"ac2-fragment06","1446","But they think they can run_-0.03 everything from Detroit and that 's the way_-0.156 the organisation is going to be restructured ."
"ac2-fragment06","1447","They are working on it right now ."
"ac2-fragment06","1448","We will know the details in a few weeks ’ time ."
"ac2-fragment06","1449","Couple of months at the latest . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1450","Mark said quietly :"
"ac2-fragment06","1451","‘ And how does that affect the European organisation ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1452","‘ The organisation will be wound_-0.25 up ."
"ac2-fragment06","1453","I 'm taking_-0.531 early retirement . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1454","‘ And me ? ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1455","Muldoon shrugged ."
"ac2-fragment06","1456","‘ Not certain yet ."
"ac2-fragment06","1457","But my guess is early retirement too , unless you 're prepared_0.091 to go back to divisional work ."
"ac2-fragment06","1458","Local MD perhaps ? ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1459","The Englishman snorted ."
"ac2-fragment06","1460","‘ You know I ca n't go back ."
"ac2-fragment06","1461","Who the hell can ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1462","In any case , you know as well as I do that the MDs are always American . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1463","‘ Well , there wo n't be any European job functions , that 's for sure , ’ Muldoon said ."
"ac2-fragment06","1464","‘ There 'll be a direct_-0.032 link_-0.242 between Detroit and the line managers in each country , with Detroit calling_-0.2 the shots_0 . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1465","‘ Do n't they realise they 're playing_0.353 with political dynamite_0.4 ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1466","Mark demanded ."
"ac2-fragment06","1467","‘ Mueller wo n't give_-0.333 a damn about the effect of a corporate_0.114 plan_-0.062 on Europe and on individual countries ."
"ac2-fragment06","1468","If he wants to import vehicles or components from Taiwan or Singapore or Hong Kong into Europe , he 'll go_-0.212 ahead_-0.062 and do it , regardless of the economic consequences for the European countries concerned ."
"ac2-fragment06","1469","The only thing_-0.438 you can be sure of is that US interest will always come_-0.125 first ."
"ac2-fragment06","1470","Oh , and there 's one more thing_-0.235 you can be sure of , ’ he added_-0.242 sourly_0.406 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1471","‘ They wo n't plan_-0.441 to supply the US market_0 from imports ."
"ac2-fragment06","1472","You can bet your bottom_0.062 dollar on that !"
"ac2-fragment06","1473","Jesus wept ! ’ he continued , hackles_0.286 rising_-0.121 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1474","‘ Mueller will have the power_0.133 to make_-0.242 or break_-0.118 whole areas of Europe ."
"ac2-fragment06","1475","He 's the last guy in the world who should be given_-0.353 such power_-0.2 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1476","The bloody_0.375 man 's power_0 drunk_0.257 already . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1477","He was angry and bitter_0.222 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1478","‘ I know , ’ Muldoon agreed sadly ."
"ac2-fragment06","1479","‘ Then what are you and Clancy doing about it ? ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1480","‘ Look_-0.065 , Mark , ’ Muldoon said forlornly ‘ What 's the point_0.031 ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1481","The wheels_0.061 have already been set_-0.212 in motion_-0.097 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1482","We 're not gon na change_-0.188 anyone 's mind ."
"ac2-fragment06","1483","You know that . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1484","His tone was abject ."
"ac2-fragment06","1485","‘ Sorry you 're takin'_-0.344 it so bad , ’ he added_-0.062 miserably ."
"ac2-fragment06","1486","‘ How else should I take_-0.222 it ? ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1487","Mark demanded ."
"ac2-fragment06","1488","‘ It 's my life which is about to go_-0.294 down the plughole_0.677 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1489","I 'm not an American on a brief_0.125 overseas assignment ."
"ac2-fragment06","1490","I 've spent_-0.355 my entire working life in the European components ’ business ."
"ac2-fragment06","1491","I 've grown_0 up in it ."
"ac2-fragment06","1492","It 's in my blood_0.031 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1493","I 've built plants_-0.059 and managed them ."
"ac2-fragment06","1494","Designed products and marketed and sold them ."
"ac2-fragment06","1495","When I was an apprentice there were two component plants_0.062 in Europe , and now there are seventeen , and I 've had a hand_-0.171 in establishing the last twelve ."
"ac2-fragment06","1496","What the hell do you expect me to say ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1497","Oh , is that what they are proposing to do ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1498","Well bully_0.438 for Mueller and the Corporation ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1499","I 'll go_-0.394 and collect_-0.265 my hat_-0.125 and coat_-0.1 ! ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1500","‘ I know how you feel_-0.25 , Mark , ’ Muldoon said sadly ."
"ac2-fragment06","1501","‘ Do you , Pat ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1502","Do you ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1503","You 're sixty-one and have been looking_0 forward_0 to retirement ."
"ac2-fragment06","1504","I 'm fifty and have a long_-0.273 way_-0.353 to go ."
"ac2-fragment06","1505","I do n't think you can see_-0.455 things_-0.406 the way_-0.367 I see_-0.515 them ."
"ac2-fragment06","1506","‘ Well , perhaps not , ’ Muldoon agreed ."
"ac2-fragment06","1507","‘ But I can understand how you feel_-0.324 . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1508","The Englishman nodded and poured himself more coffee ."
"ac2-fragment06","1509","‘ So what 's going to happen to the European Plan_-0.147 ? ’ he asked ."
"ac2-fragment06","1510","‘ Mueller will drive_0.061 it from Detroit , with one or two amendments agreed at the EPC meeting , ’ Muldoon told him ."
"ac2-fragment06","1511","‘ What amendments ? ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1512","‘ No further plant_0.412 investment in the UK . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1513","‘ I suppose Mueller saw_0 to that , ’ Mark said sarcastically ."
"ac2-fragment06","1514","‘ He really hates our guts_0.182 !"
"ac2-fragment06","1515","God help the British plants_0.2 under the new regime_0.333 ! ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1516","Muldoon shook his head ."
"ac2-fragment06","1517","‘ No , it was n't that ."
"ac2-fragment06","1518","It was the strike_0.273 at Merseyside ."
"ac2-fragment06","1519","That was the last straw_0.118 as far_-0.062 as Nate was concerned ."
"ac2-fragment06","1520","Up until that news hit_-0.355 the Committee , Don had won the day with his UK Vehicle Division proposals ."
"ac2-fragment06","1521","But as soon as Nate heard about the latest strike_-0.167 , that was it ."
"ac2-fragment06","1522","End_-0.364 of story_-0.257 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1523","He instructed Mueller to phase-out vehicle manufacture in the UK . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1524","Mark nodded ."
"ac2-fragment06","1525","‘ How did Don take_-0.333 it ?"
"ac2-fragment06","1526","He was beginning to win through . ’"
"ac2-fragment06","1527","‘ He 's very upset ."
"ac2-fragment06","1528","Naturally ."
"ac2-fragment06","1529","It 's the first time in his career he has n't come_-0.515 out on top_-0.088 ."
"ac2-fragment06","1530","Mueller is taking over the plan_-0.062 , and Don is being transferred back to the States ."

"acj-fragment01","1","HOMICIDE"
"acj-fragment01","2","This chapter deals_-0.118 with the approach_0.273 of the criminal law to behaviour which causes or risks_-0.088 causing death ."
"acj-fragment01","3","Murder , manslaughter , and several other offences are discussed_-0.273 , and one recurrent issue here_-0.333 is whether English law responds_0.088 proportionately_0.065 to the different degrees_0.091 of culpability manifested in cases where death is caused ."
"acj-fragment01","4","7.1 DEATH AND FINALITY"
"acj-fragment01","5","For practical purposes , the culpable_0.273 causing of another person 's death may fairly be regarded_-0.029 as the most serious_-0.091 offence in the criminal calendar_0.471 ."
"acj-fragment01","6","There is an argument that treason is a more serious_-0.258 offence , since it strikes_0.235 at the very foundations_0.321 of the State and its social organizations , but treason is so rare_-0.032 that it is surely permissible to treat homicide as the most serious_-0.242 form_-0.206 of crime ."
"acj-fragment01","7","The reason for this is not difficult to find_-0.219 : the harm caused by many other crimes is remediable to a degree_0.147 , whereas the harm caused by homicide is absolutely irremediable ."
"acj-fragment01","8","Even in crimes of violence which leave_-0.294 some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effects , the victim retains_0.059 his or her life and , therefore , the possibility of further pleasures and achievements , whereas death is final ."
"acj-fragment01","9","This finality makes_-0.324 it proper to regard_0.121 death as the most serious_-0.143 harm that may be inflicted on another , and to regard_0.059 a person who chooses to inflict that harm as the most culpable of offenders , in the absence of some excuse or justification ."
"acj-fragment01","10","Although many deaths arise_0.118 from natural causes , and many others from illnesses and diseases , each year sees_-0.182 a large_-0.086 number of deaths caused by ‘ accidents ’ , and also a number caused by acts or omissions which amount_-0.206 to some form_-0.088 of homicide in English law ."
"acj-fragment01","11","For 1987 the statistics show_-0.314 that there were some 20,000 accidental deaths , of which some 7,000 occurred in the home , 6,000 at work , and 5,000 on the roads ."
"acj-fragment01","12","By comparison , the number of deaths recorded as criminal homicide was 600 , which includes_-0.353 all the murders and manslaughters ."
"acj-fragment01","13","This figure is relatively small_0.03 when compared with many American cities , but that is no cause for satisfaction ."
"acj-fragment01","14","There are still awkward questions to be confronted_0.344 ."
"acj-fragment01","15","For example , are we satisfied that the 600 deaths recorded as homicide are in fact more culpable_0.441 than all , or even most , of the deaths recorded as accidents ?"
"acj-fragment01","16","In other words , does English criminal law pick_-0.206 out the most heinous forms_-0.156 of killing as murders and manslaughters , or are the boundaries_-0.118 frozen_0.294 by tradition ?"
"acj-fragment01","17","Another question is whether the criminal law ought not to be wider_-0.029 in its application_0.029 to activities which carry_-0.091 some risk of causing death than in other spheres_0.242 ."
"acj-fragment01","18","Thus , even if it would be excessive to sweep_0.265 large_-0.029 numbers of the deaths now recorded as ‘ accidents ’ into the law of homicide , there may be sufficient justification for creating_0 or enforcing offences designed_0.121 to ensure safe conditions of work , safe goods , safe buildings , and so on ."
"acj-fragment01","19","It was argued in Chapter 2 that the criminal law ought to spread_0.152 its net_-0.091 wider_0.118 where the potential harm is greater_-0.485 ."
"acj-fragment01","20","It will be seen_-0.171 that English law does this up to a point_-0.235 , and in the process seems to accept_-0.235 social-defence_0.485 arguments as reasons for departing_0.03 from several of the principles set_-0.364 out in Chapter 3 ."
"acj-fragment01","21","7.2 REQUIREMENTS OF CRIMINAL HOMICIDE"
"acj-fragment01","22","English law distinguishes_-0.029 between the offences of murder and manslaughter , as we shall see , but the two crimes do have certain common elements_0.143 ."
"acj-fragment01","23","It must be proved that the defendant 's act or omission caused the death of the victim within a year and a day ."
"acj-fragment01","24","( The requirements of causation in the criminal law are discussed_-0.088 elsewhere_0.088 . )"
"acj-fragment01","25","The ‘ year and a day ’ rule_-0.147 is a legacy_0.212 of times when medical science was so rudimentary that , if there was a substantial_0.171 lapse of time between injury and death , it was unsafe to pronounce_0.471 on whether the defendant 's conduct or some other event caused the death ."
"acj-fragment01","26","Nowadays the problem is quite the reverse_0 : medical science is generally able_-0.152 to determine_-0.091 whether D's conduct caused the death , and innovations such as life-support_0.176 machines mean that life can be prolonged for months and years in some instances ."
"acj-fragment01","27","In one recent case the victim of a stabbing died two and a half years after the incident , having been kept_-0.147 on a life-support_-0.171 machine for almost the entire time ."
"acj-fragment01","28","In principle , it seems unjust that a homicide conviction should not be possible in such a case , if all the other elements_-0.032 can be established and only the ‘ year and a day ’ rule_-0.303 stands_-0.088 in the way_-0.065 ."
"acj-fragment01","29","But the rule_-0.152 was confirmed by the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980 , on the ground_0.182 that a defendant should not be left_-0.188 in peril of a homicide conviction indefinitely ."
"acj-fragment01","30","Surely prosecutorial discretion should be enough to prevent unfair convictions years after the event ."
"acj-fragment01","31","The rule_-0.057 itself is out of accord with modern medical conditions and should be abolished ."
"acj-fragment01","32","DEFINING_0.121 MURDER : THE INCLUSIONARY QUESTION"
"acj-fragment01","33","( a ) The Procedural Context_0.188"
"acj-fragment01","34","If causing death is to be regarded_0.152 as the most serious_-0.129 harm that can be inflicted , it would seem to follow_-0.091 that the most blameworthy form_-0.212 of homicide should result in the highest_0.069 sentences imposed_-0.059 by the courts ."
"acj-fragment01","35","Indeed , many systems_-0.176 of criminal law impose_0.206 a mandatory sentence for murder ( or whatever the highest_-0.061 form_-0.171 of homicide is called_-0.057 in that system_-0.303 ) ."
"acj-fragment01","36","In some jurisdictions this is a mandatory sentence of death ."
"acj-fragment01","37","In others , such as those in the United Kingdom , it is the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment ."
"acj-fragment01","38","Why should this penalty be mandatory , and not at the discretion of the court as in other offences ?"
"acj-fragment01","39","One argument in favour of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment is that it amounts_0.176 to a symbolic indication of the unique heinousness of murder ."
"acj-fragment01","40","It places_0.235 the offender under the State 's control , as it were , for the remainder of his or her life ."
"acj-fragment01","41","This is often linked_-0.206 with a supposed denunciatory effect — the idea that the mandatory life sentence denounces_0.294 murder as emphatically as possible — and with a supposed general deterrent effect , in declaring_0.212 that there is no mitigation of sentence available for this crime ."
"acj-fragment01","42","It might also be argued that the mandatory life sentence makes_-0.438 a substantial_0.333 contribution_0.086 to public safety ."
"acj-fragment01","43","None of these arguments is notably strong_-0.091 , let alone conclusive ."
"acj-fragment01","44","The mandatory penalty does indeed serve_-0.281 to mark_-0.147 out murder from other crimes , but whether the definition of murder is sufficiently refined_0.353 to capture_0.152 the worst killings , and only the worst killings , remains_0.029 to be discussed_0.059 below_-0.147 ."
"acj-fragment01","45","Whether the life sentence is regarded_-0.097 as a sufficient denunciation in society depends on the public 's perception_0.212 of what life imprisonment means : if it is widely believed that it results in an average of nine years ' imprisonment , the effect will be somewhat blunted_0.455 ."
"acj-fragment01","46","The same applies to the general deterrent argument : its effectiveness depends on whether the penalty for murder affects the calculations_0.281 of potential killers at all , and , if it does , whether life imprisonment is seen_-0.406 as significantly more or less severe_0.088 than the alternative of a long_-0.278 , fixed-term_0.156 sentence ."
"acj-fragment01","47","As for public protection , this depends on executive decisions with regard to release ; it fails_-0.094 to take_-0.257 into account_-0.088 whether it is necessary for public protection to keep ‘ lifers ’ in for so long_-0.257 ."
"acj-fragment01","48","This brings_-0.529 the discussion_-0.088 to a crucial point_-0.324 : what does the sentence of life imprisonment mean in practice , and what would be the alternative ?"
"acj-fragment01","49","What it means is that the time of release from prison is determined by the Home_0.062 Secretary , on the advice of the Parole Board and the Lord Chief Justice , rather than by the judge at the trial ."
"acj-fragment01","50","In procedural terms , therefore , the life sentence involves a transfer_0.324 of function : normally it is the judge who determines the sentence ( or at least its upper_0.147 limit_-0.061 , since earlier release on parole may be possible ) , whereas a life sentence entrusts_0.242 that function to the executive , who must first ascertain the opinions of the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge ."
"acj-fragment01","51","The Home Office is not bound_0.029 by those opinions , and appears to depart_0.029 from them frequently ."
"acj-fragment01","52","In 1983 the Home_-0.097 Secretary imposed restrictions on the release of persons serving_0.206 life for murders of police- and prison-officers , terrorist killings , murder during robbery , and the sadistic_0.294 or sexual murder of young children , fixing_0.156 a minimum of twenty years ' imprisonment for these offenders ."
"acj-fragment01","53","Whatever the justifications for introducing_-0.312 this policy , it serves_-0.281 to underline_0.091 the fact that sentencing in murder cases is enacted_0.594 without each case being considered_-0.147 individually_0.273 , after hearing representations from the offender 's counsel , and without a sentence announced in court and subject to appeal ."
"acj-fragment01","54","At present , the executive takes_0.059 decisions to release some murderers after only a few years and to keep others in prison for extremely long_-0.606 periods ."
"acj-fragment01","55","Should those decisions not be taken_-0.088 by the courts , in the same way_-0.371 as other sentencing decisions ?"
"acj-fragment01","56","The answer sometimes given_-0.152 is that murderers should be treated differently because they are particularly dangerous : anyone who chooses to kill once can choose to kill again ."
"acj-fragment01","57","But this argument will seem less persuasive_0.057 when we have discussed_0.273 cases of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility : where a murder is reduced_-0.062 to manslaughter , the judge has a wide_-0.229 sentencing discretion and may , according to the facts of the case , select a determinate prison sentence , a hospital order , or life imprisonment ."
"acj-fragment01","58","Those who kill and are convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility are no less dangerous than those convicted of murder , and yet the judge has sentencing discretion in one case and not in the other ."
"acj-fragment01","59","Considerations of this kind have led_-0.182 the House of Lords Select Committee on Murder and Life Imprisonment to recommend the abolition of the mandatory sentence for murder ."
"acj-fragment01","60","In its place_-0.324 would be a sentencing discretion , which judges would use , in many cases , to mark_0.03 the relative heinousness of the murder by a determinate prison sentence ."
"acj-fragment01","61","In cases where life imprisonment was thought to be the appropriate sentence , the trial judge would still specify — in open_-0.412 court — the number of years to be spent_-0.265 in prison , taking_-0.267 the gravity_0.371 of the offence into account_-0.083 , and release would be determined_0.118 by a judicial tribunal ."
"acj-fragment01","62","Such a reform would bring_-0.452 improvements in natural justice without loss_-0.548 of public protection ."
"acj-fragment01","63","( b ) Degrees_0.206 of Homicide"
"acj-fragment01","64","English criminal law has two degrees_0.091 of homicide , murder and manslaughter ."
"acj-fragment01","65","Many American jurisdictions have three degrees_0.062 of murder — first-degree_0.265 murder , requiring premeditation , and second- and third-degree_-0.03 murder , covering_0.091 lesser shades_0.484 of culpability ."
"acj-fragment01","66","In England there has been a proposal that we should do away with all these distinctions , leaving_-0.312 a single offence of criminal homicide ."
"acj-fragment01","67","That proposal , if implemented , would shift_-0.118 almost all the decision-making in homicide cases from the trial to the sentencing stage_0 : the only issue of any consequence in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed , and all the distinctions now drawn_0.294 at the stage_0.147 of criminal liability would be reflected_0.152 in the sentence alone ."
"acj-fragment01","68","The jury would have no role_-0.029 in most homicide cases , since a plea of guilty would be the norm ."
"acj-fragment01","69","Contrast this with the position_0.088 in jurisdictions where there are three or more degrees_0.097 of homicide : pleas of guilty to first- and second-degree_0.121 murders would be less frequent , since there would be the possibility of argument in court ( if no bargain_0.094 was struck_0.152 beforehand between prosecution and defence ) , and the defence might succeed_0 in persuading the jury to reduce_0.094 the degree_-0.061 of the killing ."
"acj-fragment01","70","Moreover , the borderlines_0.171 between the various degrees_0.206 would raise_-0.156 questions of law , which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeals ."
"acj-fragment01","71","The result would be that killings were classified and labelled_0.152 in a more refined_-0.091 way_-0.324 , but at the cost_-0.147 of lengthy trials and mounting legal-aid bills_-0.161 ."
"acj-fragment01","72","That cost_-0.333 is not difficult to justify where capital_0.147 punishment is the penalty for first-degree_0.312 murder ."
"acj-fragment01","73","Where there is no capital punishment , however , the question of how many degrees_0.152 of homicide it is desirable to have calls_-0.091 for careful_0.031 weighing_0.088 of the principle of fair labelling_0.219 ( see Chapter 3.3 ( l ) ) against the cost_-0.171 and time arguments mobilised_0.306 by the policy of efficient administration ( see Chapter 3.3 ( m ) ) ."
"acj-fragment01","74","The structure_0.091 of the English law of homicide is rather strange ."
"acj-fragment01","75","Although there are two offences , murder and manslaughter , the latter includes_-0.441 two distinct_-0.059 varieties : ‘ voluntary ’ manslaughter ( killings which would be murder but for the existence of defined_0.364 extenuating circumstances ) ; and ‘ involuntary ’ manslaughter ( killings for which there is no need to prove any awareness of the risk of death being caused , but for which there is thought to be sufficient fault to justify criminal liability ) ."
"acj-fragment01","76","The arguments therefore tend_-0.091 to focus_-0.182 on three borderline questions : What is the minimum fault required for conviction of murder ?"
"acj-fragment01","77","What conditions are needed to reduce_-0.176 murder to manslaughter ?"
"acj-fragment01","78","And what is the minimum fault required for a conviction of manslaughter ."
"acj-fragment01","79","( c ) Requirements for Murder"
"acj-fragment01","80","In English criminal law there are now two alternative fault requirements for murder : an intent to kill , or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm ."
"acj-fragment01","81","What do these requirements mean ?"
"acj-fragment01","82","Do they extend_0.125 the definition of murder too far_-0.156 , or are they too narrow_0.088 ."
"acj-fragment01","83","Intent to kill may be regarded_0.206 as the most obvious and indisputable form_-0.143 of fault element_0.455 for murder , but to some extent_0.188 that depends on the meaning of ‘ intent ’ ."
"acj-fragment01","84","This has been the subject_0.083 of a number of House of Lords decisions , and yet the definition is still not clear_-0.394 and settled_0.029 ."
"acj-fragment01","85","Probably the most accurate statement would be that a person intends to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill by the act or omission charged_0.242 , or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to follow_-0.2 from that act or omission ."
"acj-fragment01","86","In this way_-0.457 , both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are regarded_0.364 as part_-0.29 of the definition of intent , although there are other statements suggesting_0.121 that foresight of practical or ‘ virtual ’ certainty is merely evidence from which intent may be inferred ."
"acj-fragment01","87","How would this test be applied_0.156 ?"
"acj-fragment01","88","In many cases the word ‘ intent ’ is used without elaboration , but there are some for which a full_-0.469 explanation of the meaning of intention is necessary ."
"acj-fragment01","89","A fairly typical set_0 of facts is provided by Nedrick ( 1986 ) , where D had a grudge against a woman and had threatened to ‘ burn her out ’ ."
"acj-fragment01","90","One night he went to her house , poured paraffin through the letter-box and on to the front door , and set_-0.294 it alight ."
"acj-fragment01","91","One of the woman 's children died in the ensuing fire ."
"acj-fragment01","92","When asked why he did it , D replied : ‘ Just to wake her up and frighten her . ’"
"acj-fragment01","93","A defence_0.061 of this kind , a claim_0.057 that the purpose was only to frighten and not to cause harm , requires the full definition to be put_-0.176 to the jury ."
"acj-fragment01","94","The question is : granted that D's purpose was to frighten , did he nonetheless realize that it was practically certain that his act would cause death or grievous bodily harm to someone ?"
"acj-fragment01","95","The jury should answer this by drawing_-0.091 inferences from the evidence in the case and from the surrounding_-0.086 circumstances ."
"acj-fragment01","96","What about the alternative element_0.469 in the definition , an intent to cause grievous bodily harm ?"
"acj-fragment01","97","This has considerable practical importance , since this is all that the prosecution has to prove in order to obtain a verdict of guilty of murder ."
"acj-fragment01","98","It must be shown_-0.143 that the defendant intended ( which , again , includes_-0.029 both purpose and awareness of practical certainty ) to cause really serious injury to someone ."
"acj-fragment01","99","The House of Lords confirmed_-0.125 this rule_-0.452 in Cunningham ( 1981 ) : D struck his victim on the head a number of times with a chair , causing injuries from which the victim died a week later ."
"acj-fragment01","100","D maintained_0.206 throughout_0.265 that he had not intended to kill , but there was evidence from which the jury could infer — and did infer — that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm ."
"acj-fragment01","101","The House of Lords upheld_0.294 D 's conviction for murder : an intent to cause really serious_-0.147 injury is sufficient for murder , without any proof that the defendant intended , or even contemplated_0.528 , the possibility that death would result ."
"acj-fragment01","102","Does the ‘ grievous bodily harm ’ rule_0 extend_0.485 the definition of murder too far_-0.353 ?"
"acj-fragment01","103","If the point_-0.343 of distinguishing murder from manslaughter is to mark_0.086 out the most heinous group of killings for the extra stigma of a murder conviction , it can be argued that the ‘ grievous bodily harm ’ rule_-0.303 draws_-0.182 the line_-0.226 too low_-0.235 ."
"acj-fragment01","104","In terms of principle , the rule_-0.29 requires justification because it departs_0.303 from the principle of correspondence ( see Chapter 5.2(a) ) , namely that the fault element_0.156 in a crime should relate to the consequences prohibited by that crime ."
"acj-fragment01","105","By allowing_-0.059 an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to suffice for a murder conviction , the law is violating_-0.121 a general principle , turning_-0.059 the most serious_0 of its offences into a constructive_0.129 crime ."
"acj-fragment01","106","Why should it be necessary to ‘ construct_0.324 ’ a murder conviction out of this lesser intent ?"
"acj-fragment01","107","There are arguments in favour of this : death is final_0.344 , murder is the gravest crime , and there is no significant_-0.031 moral difference between someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who sets_0.029 out to kill ."
"acj-fragment01","108","No one can predict whether a serious injury will result in death — that may depend on the victim 's physique , on the speed of an ambulance , on the distance from the hospital , and on a range_0.088 of other medical and individual matters ."
"acj-fragment01","109","If one person chooses to cause serious_-0.152 injury to another , it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death , and such cases show_-0.147 a sufficiently wanton_0.303 disregard for life as to warrant the label_-0.086 ‘ murder ’ if death results ."
"acj-fragment01","110","The counter-arguments , which would uphold_0.061 the principle of correspondence , are that breach_0.167 of that principle is unnecessary when the amplitude_0.686 of the crime of manslaughter lies_0.091 beneath murder , and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes_-0.226 a number of injuries which are most unlikely to put_-0.529 the victim 's life at risk ."
"acj-fragment01","111","In the leading_0 case of Cunningham Lord Edmund-Davies ( dissenting ) gave_-0.129 the example of breaking someone 's arm : that is a really serious_-0.182 injury , but one which is unlikely to endanger the victim 's life ."
"acj-fragment01","112","So in practice the ‘ grievous bodily harm ’ rule_-0.032 goes_-0.118 further_-0.25 than the arguments of its protagonists_0.382 would support_-0.194 ."
"acj-fragment01","113","Would it be right , then , to confine_0.182 the fault element_0.206 in murder to an intent to kill ?"
"acj-fragment01","114","That would have the merit of simplicity , but would it strike_0.324 the right note_-0.031 socially ?"
"acj-fragment01","115","There are powerful_0 arguments in favour of saying that there are other killings where an intent to kill can not be established , and yet where the moral or social culpability is equal to that in most intentional killings ."
"acj-fragment01","116","Of course , one can not be adamant about whether they merit the label_0.091 ‘ murder ’ , because that is a question of drawing_0.156 the line_-0.147 between murder and manslaughter , which is not susceptible of any precise resolution ."
"acj-fragment01","117","It is hard_-0.429 to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be smaller_-0.062 or larger_-0.182 ( unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence follows_-0.091 ) ; it is a question of social judgment ."
"acj-fragment01","118","Let us briefly consider_0 some of the possibilities ."
"acj-fragment01","119","The fault element_0 for many serious_0.054 offences is intent or recklessness : why should this not suffice for murder ?"
"acj-fragment01","120","The question is whether all killings in which the defendant is aware of the risk of death are sufficiently serious_-0.088 to warrant the term ‘ murder ’ ."
"acj-fragment01","121","One answer sometimes given_-0.029 is that they are not , because a driver who overtakes on a bend , knowingly taking_-0.355 the risk that there is a car travelling in the opposite_-0.152 direction , should not be labelled_0.219 a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue ."
"acj-fragment01","122","This example assumes_-0.29 that a sympathy for motorists with overwhelm_0.273 any tendency to logical analysis ."
"acj-fragment01","123","One might ask whether motorists are ever justified in knowingly taking_-0.265 risks with other people 's lives ."
"acj-fragment01","124","Yet if the example is modified_0.121 a little , so that the overtaking is on a country road at night and the risk is known to be slight_0.032 , it becomes questionable whether the causing of death in these circumstances should be labelled_0.455 in the same way_-0.2 as intentional killings ."
"acj-fragment01","125","This is not to suggest that motorists should be treated differently ."
"acj-fragment01","126","The point_-0.054 is rather that , even though knowingly taking_-0.176 risks with other people 's lives is usually unjustifiable , taking_-0.371 a slight_-0.353 risk is less serious_-0.118 than intentionally causing death ."
"acj-fragment01","127","In discussing_-0.2 the boundaries_0.323 of murder , we are concerned with classification , not exculpation ."
"acj-fragment01","128","To classify all reckless killings as murder might be too broad_-0.083 , but the point_-0.094 remains_0.182 that some reckless killings may be thought no less heinous than intentional killings ."
"acj-fragment01","129","Can a satisfactory line_-0.167 be drawn_-0.147 here_-0.273 ?"
"acj-fragment01","130","One approach_-0.029 would be to draw_-0.176 the line_0.088 by reference to the degree_0.219 of probability ."
"acj-fragment01","131","Murder is committed in those situations_0.125 where D caused death by an act or omission which he knew had death as the probable or highly probable result ."
"acj-fragment01","132","A version of this test of foresight of high_0.061 probability is used in several other European countries ; it was introduced_0.062 into English law by the decision in Hyam v."
"acj-fragment01","133","DPP ( 1975 ) , but abandoned_0.176 in Moloney ( 1985 ) on grounds_0.118 of uncertainty ."
"acj-fragment01","134","A second approach_-0.242 is to frame_0.206 the law in such a way_-0.353 as to make_-0.529 it clear_-0.312 that the court should make_-0.265 a moral judgment on the gravity of the defendant 's conduct ."
"acj-fragment01","135","Section_0.061 210.2 of the Model_0.212 Penal Code includes_-0.265 within murder those reckless killings which manifest ‘ extreme_0.182 indifference to the value_-0.147 of human life ’ ."
"acj-fragment01","136","Scots law treats_0 as murder killings with ‘ wicked_0.273 recklessness ’ , a phrase which directs_-0.061 the court 's attention to the circumstances of the killing ."
"acj-fragment01","137","Both the Model_-0.088 Penal Code test and the Scots test may be reduced_0.206 to circularity , however , for when one asks how extreme_0.094 or how wicked_0.343 the recklessness should be , the only possible answer is : ‘ wicked_0.312 or extreme_0.286 enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction ’ ."
"acj-fragment01","138","Admittedly , the Model_0.056 Penal Code does contain_-0.545 a list of circumstances which may amount_-0.091 to extreme_0.353 indifference , which assists_-0.057 the courts and increases_0.059 the predictability of verdicts in a way_-0.176 that Scots law does not , but the essence_0.324 of both approaches_0.129 is that there is no precise way_-0.273 of describing those non-intentional killings which are as heinous as intentional killings ."
"acj-fragment01","139","Their protagonists_0.333 argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation from the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed in favour of more accurate labelling_0.353 by the courts ; opponents_0.114 argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed here_-0.455 specifically to reduce_-0.061 the risk of verdicts based on discriminatory or irrelevant factors , such as distaste for the defendant 's background_0.029 , allegiance , or other activities ."
"acj-fragment01","140","A third , more precise formulation_0.333 derives_-0.156 from the recommendations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980 , namely , that a killing should be classified as murder in those situations_0.118 where there is an intention to cause serious_-0.219 injury coupled with awareness of the risk of death ."
"acj-fragment01","141","Neither an intention to cause serious injury nor recklessness as to death should be sufficient on its own , but together they restrict_0.265 one another , producing_0.091 a test which both satisfies_0.061 the criterion of certainty and marks_0.062 out some heinous but non-intended killings ."
"acj-fragment01","142","A fourth approach_0.091 , adopted_0.139 by English law_0 until 1957 and still in force_0.118 in many American jurisdictions , is some form_-0.083 of felony-murder rule : anyone who kills during the course_0.091 of a felony ( or , more restrictively , a serious crime of violence ) or whilst resisting arrest should be convicted of murder ."
"acj-fragment01","143","Thus stated , there is no reference to the defendant 's intention or awareness of the risks : the fact that D has chosen to commit rape , robbery , or another serious_-0.069 offence , and has caused death thereby , is held_-0.294 to constitute sufficient moral grounds_-0.059 for placing_-0.114 the killing in the highest_-0.088 category ."
"acj-fragment01","144","Plainly , this is a form_-0.312 of constructive_0.382 criminal liability : the murder conviction is constructed_0.343 out of the ingredients_0.059 of a lesser offence ."
"acj-fragment01","145","Presumably the justification is that D has already crossed_0.206 a high_-0.441 moral/social threshold_0.455 in choosing to commit such a serious_-0.188 offence , and should therefore be held_-0.382 liable for whatever consequences ensue , however unforeseeable they may be ."
"acj-fragment01","146","The objections would be reduced_0 if awareness of the risk of death was also required : in other words , if the test were the commission of a serious_-0.028 offence of violence plus recklessness as to death ."
"acj-fragment01","147","The effect of that test would be to pick out those reckless killings which occurred when D had already manifested substantial_0.182 moral and legal culpability , and to classify them as murder ."
"acj-fragment01","148","Four alternative approaches_0.091 have been described , and many others could be listed ."
"acj-fragment01","149","The point_0.029 is that the traditional concepts of intention and recklessness do not , of themselves , appear to be sufficiently well focused_0.176 to mark_0.235 out those killings which are the most heinous ."
"acj-fragment01","150","The law must resort_-0.062 to some kind of moral and social evaluation of conduct if it is to identify_0.194 and separate_-0.029 out the most heinous killings ."
"acj-fragment01","151","Many people might think that a person who causes death whilst using an unlawfully held firearm or explosives ought to be convicted of murder because there is , generally speaking , no excuse for using such dangerous equipment ."
"acj-fragment01","152","Some of the people thus covered_0.059 would be armed robbers , others would be terrorists ."
"acj-fragment01","153","The armed robber might say that he had no intention of using the firearm , that he carried it with him simply to frighten the victim , and that it went off accidentally : if the jury believes that , should he be convicted of murder ?"

"ahb-fragment51","708","DEBBIE ADAMS had to let her East End terrace house in London in a hurry when her husband was re-located to Ireland with two months ' notice ."
"ahb-fragment51","709","She went to a local letting agency , Landlords of 41 Roman Road , Bethnal Green , London E2 , who found_-0.061 a tenant that day ."
"ahb-fragment51","710","She also employed_-0.121 Landlords to manage the let ."
"ahb-fragment51","711","As is common practice , Landlords kept_-0.286 the tenant 's deposit_0.206 of £650 and told_-0.529 Debbie they would take_-0.471 their entire fee of £881 up front_0.167 , so she expected no rent for the first month ."
"ahb-fragment51","712","But July also passed_0.147 without Debbie receiving any money ."
"ahb-fragment51","713","‘ I phoned and said , ‘ Where 's the money ? ’ and was told there were problems with the book-keeper , who would be coming_0.258 in to sort_-0.057 it out , ’ says Debbie ."

"ahb-fragment51","715","She repeatedly phoned_0.273 Landlords , but was either unable to get_-0.647 an answer_-0.212 or told_-0.057 that manager Howard Keizner was unavailable_0.057 ."
"ahb-fragment51","716","Finally , after the third month passed_-0.324 with no rent received , Debbie phoned the tenants , asked them to pay her directly_0.176 , and sent_-0.5 Landlords a recorded-delivery letter , which was returned , and finally one by ordinary post stating_-0.182 that Landlords were no longer employed_0.056 as the managing agents ."
"ahb-fragment51","717","Because they had n't done any management , Debbie felt_-0.441 Landlords were entitled_0.303 only to the 10 per cent tenant-finding_-0.152 fee and therefore owed her £2,400 ( 3 months ' rent plus the deposit_0.147 ) ."
"ahb-fragment51","718","In December 1991 she sued ."
"ahb-fragment51","719","Landlords did n't acknowledge_0.219 the writ , so in January Debbie 's solicitor requested a judgment in default for the full_-0.1 amount plus interest and court fees , a total of £2,453.24 ."

"ahb-fragment51","744","If the letting agent is not managing the flat , the tenant 's deposit_-0.029 should be given_-0.057 to the owner immediately_0.088 ."

"ahc-fragment61","1254","PEOPLE tend to look_-0.394 vague_-0.031 when you mention Poitou ."
"ahc-fragment61","1255","‘ Umm … not a part_-0.156 of France we know … where exactly is it ? ’"
"ahc-fragment61","1256","Inland of La Rochelle , you say ; north of Cognac and east of Limoges ."
"ahc-fragment61","1257","You sort of pass it without realising , going to the Dordogne ."
"ahc-fragment61","1258","‘ Ah yes — Cognac ."
"ahc-fragment61","1259","Nice is it ? ’"
"ahc-fragment61","1260","Well , better than that , and one of the best things_-0.235 about it is the fact that so few people , except the French themselves , bother with it ."
"ahc-fragment61","1261","Even for France , the variety to be found_-0.125 is enormous_0.412 ."
"ahc-fragment61","1262","My passion is for its numerous Romanesque churches , in most cases humbly_0.412 proportioned but elevated_0.219 into unique works of art by the richness of their exquisitely-sculpted decoration ; to go to Poitou/Saintonge and not look at any of its churches would be like going_-0.312 to an African_-0.206 game_0 reserve_-0.091 and ignoring_0.182 the animals_-0.088 ."
"ahc-fragment61","1263","For serious_0.083 drinkers there is the production of cognac to investigate around Cognac , plus the chance to sample pineau , the powerful_-0.139 local aperitif made from young_0.176 wine laced_0.441 with cognac ."
"ahc-fragment61","1264","To the north , where Poitou borders_0.088 on the Vendee , shapely clumps_0.324 of trees are almost the only punctuation_0.167 marks_-0.121 on widespreading marshy landscapes ; to the south it bubbles_0.452 with little rolling hills ."
"ahc-fragment61","1265","Water is everywhere : canals , streams , small busy_0.147 rivers with charming names like the Boutonne , the Mignon and the Belle , and big lazy_0.529 rivers like the Sevre Niortaise and the Charente ."
"ahc-fragment61","1266","The lower reaches of the Sevre Niortaise are swollen with the waters that once covered the whole area , until medieval monks started to dig a spider-web_0.156 of ditches to drain it ."
"ahc-fragment61","1267","Now the Marais Poitevin is a pleasantly low-profile_0.072 tourist attraction where you can take_-0.353 canal-boat trips_-0.121 from villages that have hardly changed in the 15-odd years I 've known them : Maillezais , with a huge and rather dull_0.265 ruined abbey , and Coulon , where I first ate the delicious local version of moules marinieres called mouclade ."
"ahc-fragment61","1268","Drifting_0.364 between grassy polders to which farmers have to ferry their cattle in punts , or following_0.235 leafy twisting_0.059 lanes marked_0 only by rusty signs proclaiming_0.235 the ‘ Venise Verte ’ , you 're in an all-green , mysteriously silent_-0.206 world_0.152 ; only the occasional fisherman , twitching his rod above the algae-smothered_0.667 waters , disturbs_0.125 the stillness ."
"ahc-fragment61","1269","There is more greenery further south in the deep forest of Chize ( with the fine_-0.156 Renaissance chateau of Dampierre-sur-Boutonne at its edge ) ; and more marshes to the west around Rochefort and Marennes , where those mussels and oysters are raised_-0.176 ."
"ahc-fragment61","1270","One of the region 's strangest townlets sits_-0.059 on those marshes : Brouage ."
"ahc-fragment61","1271","Somnolent now within its low grey walls and stumpy towers , it was once rich_0.2 on salt , and powerful_0.147 to boot ."
"ahc-fragment61","1272","It had a son_0.129 to be proud_-0.088 of : Samuel Champlain , founder of Quebec , who was born there around_-0.121 1569 ."
"ahc-fragment61","1273","A century later , it had an adoptive_0.412 daughter_-0.094 to weep_0.242 for : 20-year-old Marie Mancini , niece of Louis XIV 's minister Mazarin ."
"ahc-fragment61","1274","She went there when her romance with the young king was quashed_0.406 for political reasons ."
"ahc-fragment61","1275","Months later , when Marie had departed , Louis is said to have paused nostalgically at Brouage on his way to Paris after marrying the Spanish Infanta at St Jean-de-Luz ."
"ahc-fragment61","1276","As you come back from Brouage towards St Jean-d'Angely — on the D18 via the canalside village of Pont-l'Abbe-d'Arnoult , with a lovely Romanesque church faade — a sign at the junction of the D122 points_-0.091 you to the chateau whose improbably perfect lake and gardens stare_0.133 at you from posters throughout the region : La Roche Courbon ."
"ahc-fragment61","1277","Its most surprising room , covered from ceiling to floor in 17th-century paintings , should be a salon or library ; instead , a dotty stone bathtub was set into one wall at a later date by a lady called Charlotte ."
"ahc-fragment61","1278","She never used it , having got_-0.367 some of the plumbing details_0 wrong ."
"ahc-fragment61","1279","Wriggling_0.625 across country on the D216 to Port-d'Envaux , you come to two more chateaux : 18th-century Panloy , flaking romantically away_-0.353 on its hillock overlooking a bend in the Charente and , almost next door_0.065 , the much older , moated Crazannes , half-smothered_0.469 in amazing flamboyant Gothic carving ."
"ahc-fragment61","1280","Crossing the autoroute and turning north on the D127 brings_0.242 you to St Jean-d'Angely by way of the isolated church of Fenioux ."
"ahc-fragment61","1281","Its conically-roofed tower , hugged_0.3 about by a brood_0.485 of smaller roofs shaped_0.031 like candle_0.059 snuffers_0.438 , is visible for miles ."
"ahc-fragment61","1282","St Jean-d'Angely is a charming little town : there are good shops as well as half-timbered houses along its narrow old streets , one spanned by an ancient bell-tower ."
"ahc-fragment61","1283","There 's also a Renaissance fountain , and an extremely odd_-0.206 conglomeration of church buildings comprising one ancient ruin , one proper church , and the skeleton_0.226 faade and nave of a rather pompous_0.545 and unfinished 18th-century abbey ."
"ahc-fragment61","1284","It makes_-0.235 a conveniently central hub_0.062 : the Marais Poitevin village of Coulon is 27 miles to the north by the D120 , which inexplicably changes_-0.188 its number at the top of a hill to D115 ."
"ahc-fragment61","1285","Niort is about the same distance by the parallel N150 ."
"ahc-fragment61","1286","Saintes , with Gallo-Roman remains , a beautiful Romanesque abbey and an atmospheric_0.562 medieval quarter , is 17 miles south of St Jean ; 15-odd miles to the north-west is Surgeres , all of whose public buildings , including an engagingly asymmetrical church , are within the 16th-century castle walls , scattered among beautiful gardens and parkland — perfect for picnicking ."
"ahc-fragment61","1287","Just under_-0.088 10 miles south-west of St Jean , on the Brouage road , St-Savinien is at the upper limit of the tidal reaches of the Charente ."
"ahc-fragment61","1288","The villagers ' main hobby seems to be fishing with peculiar , saucer-shaped_0.147 nets suspended from precariously-perched bankside huts ."
"ahc-fragment61","1289","One fisherman waxed_0.324 lyrical about the variety of fish in the river ."
"ahc-fragment61","1290","‘ Even salmon , ’ he assured me , ‘ but of course those are protected and must be thrown back ."
"ahc-fragment61","1291","Which they are … normalement . ’"
"ahc-fragment61","1292","Like almost every other Poitevin town and village , St-Savinien has a sweet_0.125 Romanesque church ; Melle , indeed has three ."
"ahc-fragment61","1293","But Aulnay , just over_-0.531 10 miles north-east of St Jean , is probably the best , its unassuming_0.206 architecture a perfect frame_0.094 for the sheer_0.03 artistry of the carvings round its doors and windows ."
"ahc-fragment61","1294","Biblical motifs_0.314 recur — some art-experts call_-0.324 them sermons_0.375 in stone_-0.062 , and their messages_0.219 would certainly have been clear_-0.333 to the often-illiterate medieval pilgrims trudging to Santiago de Compostela in Spain ."
"ahc-fragment61","1295","But these themes are always interspersed with more fanciful ones : grimacing_0.273 masks , weird animals , exuberant_0.455 abstract patterns ."
"ahc-fragment61","1296","I think those 10th- and 11th-century sculptors were motivated not just by piety but also by a certain competitive spirit_0.094 : if a church was finer_-0.2 than the one in the next village , more pilgrims would surely pause there ."
"ahc-fragment61","1297","Today 's attraction-merchants_0.156 are doing no more to lure 20th-century tourists than their medieval_0.2 forebears_0.312 did for pilgrims_0.324 ."
"ahd-fragment06","47","Way_-0.226 of the World_-0.029 : Farming notes"
"ahd-fragment06","48","By AUBERON WAUGH"
"ahd-fragment06","49","MANY will take_-0.257 it as a further surrender_0.361 to Common Market bureaucracy that an inspectorate will soon be established to regulate_0.273 the smell of farm manure ."
"ahd-fragment06","50","In fact , with the development of deep-litter hen houses and intensive pig culture , some such controls_-0.094 are necessary ."
"ahd-fragment06","51","The smell released_0.031 by a pig or chicken farm is indescribable , and can affect 10 square miles of countryside around ."
"ahd-fragment06","52","One may doubt whether modern farming has any useful purpose nowadays when everybody is on a diet ."
"ahd-fragment06","53","It mostly seems to involve_0.094 producing food for animals to eat , whose excrement is then collected to assist_-0.25 the growth of more food for animals ."
"ahd-fragment06","54","Small_-0.281 children can sometimes be persuaded to eat cow cake_0.219 in the same way_-0.265 that old people will eat cat food , but the chief_0.278 result of all this farming was to produce huge food mountains_0.257 which we could then refuse to give_-0.588 to the Third World_0 , or to the socialists of Eastern Europe , in order to teach them the error of their ways_-0.121 ."
"ahd-fragment06","55","However , there is a new_-0.182 plan_0.033 to turn_-0.2 land over to wind farming ."
"ahd-fragment06","56","It involves_-0.226 nothing more than putting up 80-foot masts_0.29 all over the land ."
"ahd-fragment06","57","A 1,500-acre grouse moor will generate enough electricity in this way_-0.3 to power a town of 6,000 people ."
"ahd-fragment06","58","The farmer receives a rent of £15,000 a year and is relieved_0.156 of the need to do any work for it ."
"ahd-fragment06","59","All the food we need will be provided by monster underground funguses producing a regular_0.182 crop of mushrooms without human assistance ."
"ahd-fragment06","60","The masts_0.455 may seem unsightly to those unused to them , but I am sure it is simply a matter of getting accustomed ."
"ahd-fragment06","61","Cows were thought very unsightly when they were first introduced_-0.03 ."
"ahd-fragment06","62","Nowadays , we all swoon_0.25 with pleasure at the sight of a cow ."

"ahe-fragment03","35","DUVETS , phonecards , hot showers and video films will greet_0.235 inmates at Britain 's first privately-run prison when it opens_-0.441 on Monday ."
"ahe-fragment03","36","The Wolds , a remand centre_0.091 at Brough , North Humberside , is far_-0.235 removed_0.118 from the insanitary conditions which prevail at many jails ."
"ahe-fragment03","37","The 320 inmates will be allowed out of their cells for 14 hours a day with a minimum of six hours education and 13 hours exercise a week ."
"ahe-fragment03","38","The £32 million remand prison has 156 single and 72 shared cells , each with its own lavatory and washbasin ."
"ahe-fragment03","39","Recreation areas have telephones and pool tables ."
"ahe-fragment03","40","Nail clippers , combs , toothpaste and toothbrushes , razors and washbags are neatly laid out on tables in the cells to await_-0.182 the arrival of inmates , many of whom will not be carrying such items because they may not have expected to be remanded in custody ."
"ahe-fragment03","41","‘ The cells are luxurious compared to some of the things_-0.471 we put up with in the Army , ’ said one staff member_-0.152 during a Press tour of the jail ."
"ahe-fragment03","42","The prison has a medical block_-0.029 with 24 beds and a gym with equipment that staff said_-0.486 would be the envy_0.182 of many council leisure centres ."
"ahe-fragment03","43","Group 4 Remand Services Ltd , the security firm selected_0.03 by the Home Office to manage_-0.176 The Wolds in a £5 million-a-year contract , likes_-0.176 to think_-0.25 of its prisoners_0.235 as customers ."
"ahe-fragment03","44","‘ It may seem a little odd_-0.029 for prison staff to be looking_-0.312 at their prisoners as customers_0.212 , but they are the direct_-0.156 consumers_0.235 of our service , ’ explained Mr Stephen Twinn , prison director , who spent_-0.219 23 years in the public sector_0.152 at various grades of prison governor ."
"ahe-fragment03","45","The 60 male warders or ‘ custody officers ’ as they are called , wear a dapper_0.281 outfit of black blazers , grey trousers , white shirts and grey tie ."

"ahf-fragment24","536","By MARTYN HARRIS"
"ahf-fragment24","537","AT THE drop-in centre on South Meadowell , Labour candidate Paddy Cosgrove has dropped in to meet the people — mostly fat ladies in shellsuits with laps full of chips ."
"ahf-fragment24","538","‘ You all know me , ’ says Paddy , and a fat lady with good timing says , ‘ I do n't know you ."
"ahf-fragment24","539","Never seen you in me life . ’"

"ahf-fragment24","541","Another digs_0.065 the cream from the centre of a pink fancy and smears it in his hair ."
"ahf-fragment24","542","Paddy Cosgrove , councillor and barrister , in candidates ' pinstripes , sits tensely_0.353 on the edge of his plastic chair ."
"ahf-fragment24","543","‘ I 'm a regular_-0.303 visitor to this estate … ’"
"ahf-fragment24","544","‘ Who does he say he is ? ’ says a second fat lady ."

"ahf-fragment24","546","‘ He 's better looking on TV … ’"
"ahf-fragment24","547","‘ He 's only come because the press are here , ’ says the first fat lady ."
"ahf-fragment24","548","And Paddy Cosgrove blushes ."
"ahf-fragment24","549","Political consciousness_0.543 is low_-0.03 on the Meadowell Estate ."
"ahf-fragment24","550","Turnout at the last election was around_-0.182 50 per cent , and with the thinning_0.121 of the electoral roll_-0.061 brought_0 by the poll tax , will be even lower_-0.406 this time ."
"ahf-fragment24","551","They are mostly Labour voters but several confuse their Labour candidate with the leader of the Liberal Democrats ."
"ahf-fragment24","552","Very few know their MP is a Conservative , and hardly anyone that his name is Neville Trotter , defender_0.353 of a slender_0.265 2,500 majority ."
"ahf-fragment24","553","By most measures_0.182 Meadowell is the worst council estate in Britain , and probably the most notorious since the riots last September , which followed_-0.375 the deaths of joyriders Colin Atkins and Dale Robson in a police chase ."
"ahf-fragment24","554","In fact Meadowell is an Elastoplast_0.375 name like Sizewell , invented in the 1970s to disguise_0.029 what was already a running_-0.088 sore_0.257 ."
"ahf-fragment24","555","When built in 1938 it was The Ridges , which is still what they call it locally — a slum clearance project on the north bank of the Tyne , 10 miles east of Newcastle ."
"ahf-fragment24","556","Its first inhabitants were shipyard and fishquay workers from the riverside towns of North Shields and Wallsend , who moved happily from their tumbledown terraces to these fine_-0.031 new houses with inside toilets and gardens ."
"ahf-fragment24","557","Many , like Ronnie Collyer , a retired shipyard worker , still live here and are still proud of the place ."
"ahf-fragment24","558","All the trouble , says Ronnie , is down to ‘ a few families who doa n't keep their young ’ uns in order_-0.182 ."
"ahf-fragment24","559","And then the media coom_0.515 down and blow_-0.121 everything up . ’"

"ahf-fragment24","561","‘ It 's a canny_0.576 place The Ridges , with plenty of good folk . ’"
"ahf-fragment24","562","But something was wrong from the start_-0.273 ."
"ahf-fragment24","563","Some say it was the importing_0.265 of whole_-0.382 streets of fighting_0.286 families from the fishquays , with their dockland diversions_0.375 of prostitution , drug-dealing and handling_0.125 ."
"ahf-fragment24","564","Others say it was the shortage of pubs , shops , churches , transport and police stations ."
"ahf-fragment24","565","By the 1950s , The Ridges was the criminal ghetto_0.235 of Newcastle , and by the 1970s a costly_-0.062 council manicure_0.281 job had turned it into a free-fire zone ."
"ahf-fragment24","566","Paths and boundaries_0.424 vanished_0.222 , allowing_-0.114 the tides_0.062 of street life to wash_0.233 right up to the doorsteps ."
"ahf-fragment24","567","Joyriders used front lawns to practise their handbrake turns ."
"ahf-fragment24","568","Car theft became so common that private cars virtually disappeared from the area ."
"ahf-fragment24","569","Shops like greengrocers and chippies , with pitiful_0.029 cash takings , were routinely subjected to armed robberies with shotguns , balaclavas — the whole_-0.182 bit_-0.176 ."
"ahf-fragment24","570","When I ask the fat ladies at the drop-in centre what is the one thing_-0.323 that would do most to improve the estate they say ‘ get rid of the kids ’ and they are only half joking ."
"ahf-fragment24","571","The age structure_0.182 of Meadowell means_-0.286 it is awash_0.686 with teenagers , whose only pastimes are having babies and body-building ."
"ahf-fragment24","572","Do your husbands come here ?"
"ahf-fragment24","573","I ask , and they all laugh ."
"ahf-fragment24","574","‘ The men are all useless_-0.031 — sitting indoors if there 's trouble in the street ."
"ahf-fragment24","575","It 's women have to go out and deal_-0.182 with it . ’"
"ahf-fragment24","576","By the time of the riots a quarter of all houses on the estate were boarded up and burned out by infant_0.333 petrol bombers ."
"ahf-fragment24","577","Unemployment was 80 per cent on some streets ."
"ahf-fragment24","578","In Meadowell Primary , which has 232 children , every one was receiving a clothing grant ."
"ahf-fragment24","579","The area had effectively been abandoned_0.229 by the authorities , a fact which became clear_0.182 during the riot itself , when police waited five hours to enter the estate and put_-0.032 down the disturbances ."
"ahf-fragment24","580","‘ And there were never more than a few dozen ringleaders , ’ Bob Mather , a local butcher , tells me ."
"ahf-fragment24","581","‘ I was stood outside me shop all night , and most were no more than kids . ’"
"ahf-fragment24","582","Eight months on and little has changed — if anything it is rather worse ."
"ahf-fragment24","583","Unemployment is up another 17 per cent ; more houses and shops are boarded up ; burglaries and joyriding continue — and if there is less ram-raiding it is only because 50 or so of the hardest_0.029 cases are still behind bars_0.094 ."
"ahf-fragment24","584","A food co-op which tried_-0.091 to replace the burned-out shops has been closed after several break-ins , and even the drop-in centre is burgled weekly , according to project worker Sheila Auld ."
"ahf-fragment24","585","There is a new phone box , ripped from the wall and lying on the floor of her office to prove it ."
"ahf-fragment24","586","Meadowell has even discovered_-0.094 a new martyr in the shape of one Willy Hunter , a local hard_0.118 nut_0.059 awaiting trial for murder , and allegedly the victim_0.03 of a police frame-up ."
"ahf-fragment24","587","‘ Free Willy Hunter ’ say_-0.273 the graffiti , next to the old , fading graffiti for Dale Robson and Colin Atkins ."
"ahf-fragment24","588","My friend Kevin , muscleman and minicab driver , says the lads would be out rioting for Willy now if it was n't tipping_0.273 down with rain the whole_-0.088 time ."

"ahf-fragment24","595","Tory ministers , like Michael Heseltine who visited Meadowell last November , say the cash shortages are due to council profligacy and bad management ."
"ahf-fragment24","596","MP Neville Trotter is a pear-shaped_0.472 Tory with pear-shaped_0.529 vowels who has little appeal_-0.029 to the people of Meadowell , and a dwindling appeal_0.059 in the middle-class suburbs where unemployment is also climbing_0.375 ."

"ahf-fragment63","1162","The travelling chaos_0.188 of a modern party leader 's election entourage had carried_0.226 Major within a few miles of the home of the founder of the profession , a few of whose more troublesome contemporary practitioners are said to have caused him much irritation_0.133 over the 16 months of his premiership ."
"ahf-fragment63","1163","‘ A Liberal ?"
"ahf-fragment63","1164","He 's admitted_-0.121 to being a Liberal ! ’"

"ahf-fragment63","1167","He was also carrying an orange poster on a pole , urging_0.273 a vote for the local Liberal Democrat candidate ."

"ahf-fragment63","1173","There were also some lines_0.029 intended for local consumption_0.543 : ‘ Higher_-0.091 petrol prices from the Liberal Democrats … that 's not gon na help_-0.625 a rural area …"
"ahf-fragment63","1174","’ What would Bagehot have made_-0.324 of him ?"
"ahf-fragment63","1175","Like the heckler , he was a Liberal ."
"ahf-fragment63","1176","There_-0.029 the similarity ends , since judging_0.194 from his writings Bagehot was a roaring_0.344 snob , whereas judging_0.2 from his heckles the heckler was not ."
"ahf-fragment63","1177","More to the point_0 , it was Bagehot who said : ‘ A constitutional_0.429 statesman is in general a man of common opinions and uncommon abilities . ’"
"ahf-fragment63","1178","The statesman to whom he was referring_-0.059 was Peel ."
"ahf-fragment63","1179","A political commentator of our own day , Paul Johnson , quoted it not long after Major became Prime Minister to suggest_-0.091 that it was also true of him ."
"ahf-fragment63","1180","But is it still ?"
"ahf-fragment63","1181","B AGEHOT 'S phrase comes_-0.219 in a passage_-0.091 in which he appears to propound the dispiriting theory that a politician , if he wants to get_-0.529 anywhere_0.125 , must appeal_0.235 to ‘ the average_-0.031 man ’ ."
"ahf-fragment63","1182","The average_-0.176 man is ‘ a cool_-0.129 , common person , with a considerate_0.343 air , with figures in his mind , with his own business to attend_-0.029 to , with a set of ordinary opinions arising_0.088 from and suited_-0.091 to ordinary life ."

"ahf-fragment63","1185","Bagehot goes_-0.2 on to say of Peel : ‘ From a certain peculiarity of intellect and fortune , he was never in advance_0.303 of his time ."
"ahf-fragment63","1186","Of almost all the great_-0.353 measures_0 with which his name is associated , he attained great_0.111 eminence as an opponent before he attained even greater_-0.091 eminence as their advocate_0.382 . ’"
"ahf-fragment63","1187","That last sentence has more to do with Kinnock than with Major ."
"ahf-fragment63","1188","It is also a warning to all hack_0.323 Tories who think that it is a telling blow_0.114 against Kinnock to keep on pointing_-0.061 out that he has reversed_0.147 his opinions about unilateral nuclear disarmament , British membership of the EC , or anything else ."
"ahf-fragment63","1189","But the most striking thing_-0.286 about Bagehot 's essay on Peel , in the light of the last full_-0.125 week of this election campaign_0.394 , is that it simply does not apply_-0.242 to Major at all ."
"ahf-fragment63","1190","Common opinions were what got_-0.333 Major into difficulties in the first place_0.118 ."
"ahf-fragment63","1191","Between his becoming Prime Minister and his party 's fall_-0.324 in the polls about_-0.147 10 days ago , Major did nearly everthing that common opinion wanted_0 him to do ."
"ahf-fragment63","1192","This was true_-0.394 of what he did about both high_-0.091 policy and low_0 politics ."
"ahf-fragment63","1193","For example , on high_-0.25 policy common opinion said_-0.543 that there was nothing for it but to stay_-0.235 in the ERM ."

"ahf-fragment63","1195","In low_-0.206 politics , common opinion — no less common for being expensively hired_0.097 by Conservative Central Office — encouraged_0.029 him in the belief that he should fight_0 much of the election sitting down ."
"ahf-fragment63","1196","He did so , and he looked like the questioner in the studio audience rather than the answerer ."
"ahf-fragment63","1197","The result was Wobbly Week , the second week of the campaign_0.188 ."
"ahf-fragment63","1198","But last Saturday Major climbed_0.061 on to that soapbox_0.406 in Luton ."

"ahf-fragment63","1201","The jubilant_0.382 word from Kinnock 's camp_0.345 was that Major was behaving more like an opposition leader than a prime minister ."
"ahf-fragment63","1202","But there seemed nothing wrong with the head_-0.286 of government appearing to be the challenger_0.375 on the hustings ."
"ahf-fragment63","1203","President Truman did so in a campaign_0.303 which no-one expected him to win , and he won ."
"ahf-fragment63","1204","It is justified_0.278 if the head_-0.071 of government is challenging_-0.03 something powerful_-0.257 ."
"ahf-fragment63","1205","Kinnock complains of the alleged power of the Tory tabloid press , but he has powers_0.161 on his side_-0.312 too ."
"ahf-fragment63","1206","Ninety per cent of his party 's cash comes_-0.424 from the unions , which will expect_-0.361 a return_-0.091 ."
"ahf-fragment63","1207","The British people have in the past found_-0.03 them rather more powerful_0.212 than the corporations which are popularly supposed to finance the Conservative party ."
"ahf-fragment63","1208","Then there are all those schoolteachers , dons , television producers , writers on arts pages and members_-0.091 of the agitating classes who want_-0.486 a Labour win in order to impose Political Correctness ."
"ahf-fragment63","1209","That is to say , they will have what the Jesuits once attached_-0.086 such importance to : power_0.059 over young or impressionable minds ."
"ahf-fragment63","1210","As the week went_-0.371 by , Major rejected common opinion about_-0.406 two other large_-0.438 subjects_-0.29 : proportional representation and Scottish devolution ."
"ahf-fragment63","1211","He hardened_0.303 his opposition to both , despite the fact that his own party chairman had once favoured the first , and vocal forces_-0.029 within his Scottish party were in support of the second ."
"ahf-fragment63","1212","E VEN at this late hour , psephology , demographics and luck suggest_-0.219 that the Tories could still emerge_0.111 as the biggest_-0.188 single party in a hung_0.206 Parliament ."

"ahf-fragment63","1214","If so , we are dealing_-0.194 with a more Quixotic , romantic or principled figure than some of us used to think ."
"ahf-fragment63","1215","Once that soapbox_0.364 came_-0.206 out , Major campaigned as if he would now do and say what he really thought ."
"ahf-fragment63","1216","Was it too late ?"

"ahl-fragment02","5","by Greg Neale Environment Correspondent"
"ahl-fragment02","6","HUNDREDS of thousands of dolphins could be saved from death thanks_-0.114 to pioneering work by British scientists ."
"ahl-fragment02","7","They believe they have found_-0.469 a cheap , practical means_-0.114 of preventing dolphins entangling themselves in monofilament drift fishing nets — the ‘ walls_0.219 of death ’ believed to be responsible_0.029 for killing large numbers of dolphins off Cornwall this year ."
"ahl-fragment02","8","But their work is hampered_0.324 by lack of money ."

"ahl-fragment02","10","The researchers , headed_-0.242 by Dr Margaret Klinowska , a Cambridge biologist , and David Goodson , an expert on acoustic engineering at Loughborough University , say_-0.265 new_-0.412 data shows_-0.061 that plastic sound reflectors_0.588 to fishing nets can warn_-0.206 dolphins of hazards ."
"ahl-fragment02","11","Data to be published shortly draws on experiments including observations of Freddy , the dolphin that has been living off the Northumbrian coast for four years ."
"ahl-fragment02","12","Using equipment donated_-0.083 by Racal , the scientists have analysed recordings of the ‘ clicking ’ dolphins make while hunting ."
"ahl-fragment02","13","Observations of Freddy led_-0.531 them to conclude that dolphins use_-0.455 sonar while hunting ."
"ahl-fragment02","14","They emit an intense , broad-band ‘ click ’ or pulse_0.118 of sound ."
"ahl-fragment02","15","Echoes of the signal alert_0.088 them to possible prey , at ranges up to 80–90 metres in shallow waters ."
"ahl-fragment02","16","Mr Goodson , who became interested in the sonar capacity_0.097 of dolphins after hearing one while swimming off the Welsh coast , has experimented_0.212 with various shapes of sound reflectors_0.5 ."
"ahl-fragment02","17","The most promising is eliptical , about_-0.219 3½in long ."
"ahl-fragment02","18","The theory is that its internal air pocket will ‘ bounce_0.086 ’ back the dolphin 's sonar signal , regardless of the direction of approach ."
"ahl-fragment02","19","Last autumn , Dr Klinowska , Mr Goodson and their team_-0.344 put_-0.424 the theories into practice ."
"ahl-fragment02","20","In the Moray Firth , they placed a ‘ headline_0.147 barrier_0.312 ’ , from which they had suspended reflectors_0.412 at two-metre intervals ."
"ahl-fragment02","21","The movement of dolphins around the barrier_0.258 was observed , using electronic equipment to monitor sonar activity_0.219 ."
"ahl-fragment02","22","‘ The results exceeded our expectations , ’ said Mr Goodson ."
"ahl-fragment02","23","Dolphins swimming near the barrier_0.371 altered their behaviour to avoid it , the result , the scientists believe , of them detecting_0 sonar echoes from the reflectors_0.303 ."
"ahl-fragment02","24","Dr Klinowska said that , although it was necessary to be cautious about the findings , a combination of reflector_-0.062 devices and some modification of fishing gear might reduce_-0.129 deaths ."
"ahl-fragment02","25","But the Moray Firth experiments were only possible after the naturalist Dr David Bellamy helped secure_-0.088 a donation_0.061 from the Co-operative Wholesale Society ."

"al0-fragment06","180","The ‘ angel_0.032 ’ in question was an American woman who calls herself Rytasha ."
"al0-fragment06","181","Apart from a particularly vicious-looking_0.257 nose-job and alarming turquoise-coloured contact lenses , Rytasha is rather beautiful , and in the 1970s , when she went_-0.206 by the name of Ricki , she was a successful model_-0.2 ( she began life as Maxine Shenkman ) ."
"al0-fragment06","182","An earlier film by Raphael , The Persuaders ( 1986 ) , charted_0.4 the transformation of Ricki into Rytasha , which occurred_-0.324 at the Hare Krishna Temple in London , and her uneasy_0.182 relationship with her guru there ."
"al0-fragment06","183","It would have been interesting to have seen the two films together_-0.118 ."

"al2-fragment23","254","MORE than 800 Lloyd 's of London members_0.176 on syndicates managed_0 by the loss-making Gooda Walker agency have failed in their legal attempt to prevent Lloyd 's and members_-0.121 ' agents from drawing_-0.097 down their funds ."
"al2-fragment23","255","Michael Freeman , the solicitor who advised the members_-0.121 on court action , said yesterday : ‘ This will cause the most dreadful hardship ."

"al2-fragment23","258","However , he suggested there was perhaps a need to look_-0.588 into the system_-0.094 more closely ."
"al2-fragment23","259","Costs were awarded to the members_0.133 ' agents but not to Lloyd 's ."
"al2-fragment23","260","The members_-0.031 , many of whom are unable to fulfil the latest £101m cash call_0.097 due on March 2 to cover_-0.226 1989–90 losses on syndicates were seeking_-0.059 an interim injunction to stop_-0.303 members_-0.147 ' agents and Lloyd 's dipping_0.094 into their security ."

"al5-fragment03","19","Labour sought_0.1 to turn_-0.03 the general election into a referendum on the NHS , asking_-0.125 voters for a mandate to reverse_0.091 the changes ."
"al5-fragment03","20","Mrs Bottomley is convinced the Tory victory provides the opportunity to entrench the reforms — and to give_-0.387 doctors , nurses and managers the confidence to make_-0.281 them work_-0.118 ."
"al5-fragment03","21","In her first full_-0.212 interview since being appointed Health Secretary , she said the election result , and Mr Major 's unequivocal commitment to the NHS , had finally ‘ nailed_0.303 the lie ’ about privatisation of health care ."

"alp-fragment01","1","a Non-punitive Paradigm of Probation Practice : Some Sobering Thoughts L.R. SINGER"
"alp-fragment01","2","Lawrence Singer is an Assistant Chief Probation Officer with Merseyside Probation Service ."
"alp-fragment01","3","Beforehand he worked as a probation officer for Berkshire Probation Service and later as a research officer for Somerset Probation Service where he undertook the research reported here ."
"alp-fragment01","4","The paradigm which is described originates_0.088 from doctoral research into generic probation practice and has been presented_0.061 in a book Adult Probation and Juvenile Supervision : Beyond the Care-Control Dilemma ( 1989 , Gower ) ."
"alp-fragment01","5","SUMMARY"
"alp-fragment01","6","The Government White Paper Crime , Justice and Protecting the Public proposes_0.273 a radical change for probation practice ."
"alp-fragment01","7","Henceforth probation work will no longer be an alternative to punishment but an alternative form_-0.265 of punishment ."
"alp-fragment01","8","This article challenges_0.029 the conceptual and practical appropriateness of applying_0.031 the notion of punishment to the probation context_0.257 ."
"alp-fragment01","9","Probation officers , it is argued , are concerned with establishing rules_0.059 for probationers and not inflicting pain_-0.229 on them ."
"alp-fragment01","10","An alternative non-punitive paradigm of probation practice is described ."
"alp-fragment01","11","The paradigm is based_-0.125 on the joint supervisory aims_0.062 of support_-0.062 and surveillance which are implemented through the methods of counselling , assisting , directing , and monitoring ."
"alp-fragment01","12","To illustrate_0.176 the paradigm , reference is made_-0.281 to an alcohol education course_-0.176 developed for offenders in trouble through drink ."
"alp-fragment01","13","The efficacy of the alcohol project and the non-punitive paradigm is demonstrated by the results reported from a three year evaluation study covering_0.242 152 offenders ."
"alp-fragment01","14","The article concludes_0.091 with an affirmation of the disciplined but non-punitive character_0.118 of current probation work and argues_-0.059 that , to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offenders into the community , the probation officer 's employment of established social work knowledge , skills , and values is a strength_-0.091 not a weakness_-0.057 ."
"alp-fragment01","15","The aim_-0.121 of this article is to challenge_0.059 the assertion contained_0.212 in the White Paper Crime , Justice and Protecting the Public ( Home Office , 1990a ) that probation practice can be conceived_0.091 of as a form_0.059 of punishment in the community ."
"alp-fragment01","16","Issue will be taken_-0.182 with the appropriateness of applying_-0.057 the concept of punishment to the probation context_0.029 through reference to a demanding_-0.121 and successful_0 probation project concerned_0.086 with offenders in trouble through drink ."
"alp-fragment01","17","In describing the project , a non-punitive model_0.094 for understanding probation practice will be developed ."
"alp-fragment01","18","This non-punitive paradigm will provide_-0.312 a framework_0.206 for contrasting the efficacy of current practice with future plans_-0.088 inappropriately to transform_0.333 probation work into ‘ a new approach_-0.281 to punishment in the community ’ ( p. 18 , para. 4.3 ) ."
"alp-fragment01","19","The punitive approach_-0.061 anticipated for the Probation Service in the White Paper is underpinned_0.314 by a definition of punishment that resides_0.382 ‘ in the restrictions on liberty and in the enforcement of the orders_0.059 ’ ."
"alp-fragment01","20","The White Paper goes_-0.364 on to emphasize_0.281 : ‘ It is the loss_-0.294 of liberty involved in carrying out the terms_-0.118 of the order_-0.111 rather than the activities carried out during the order_0.032 which is the punishment ’ ( p. 18 , para. 4.4 ) ."
"alp-fragment01","21","Notwithstanding the popular appeal and political capital_0.361 to be derived from such a humane-sounding_0.114 statement , this definition is nevertheless at variance with the traditional understanding of the meaning of punishment ."
"alp-fragment01","22","Discourses on punishment and dictionary definitions of the term_-0.156 clearly_-0.323 specify the central_0.114 feature_0.333 of punishment as being the infliction of pain_-0.314 rather than the loss_-0.121 of liberty per se ( Hudson , 1987 ) ."
"alp-fragment01","23","The conceptual and practical implications of this discrepancy will be examined in the third and final section_0.029 of this article ."
"alp-fragment01","24","Beforehand , however , consideration will be given_-0.152 first to the probation project and second to its evaluation ."
"alp-fragment01","25","In these sections_0.176 punishment will be understood to mean the infliction of pain_-0.059 and the review of the project will seek_0.029 to demonstrate that the probation practice described is not only more demanding_0.387 but also more effective than this traditional understanding of punishment ."
"alp-fragment01","26","At a time when the Home_-0.062 Secretary is inviting_0 the Probation Service to ‘ move_-0.571 centre_0.147 stage_-0.029 in the Criminal Justice System_0.265 ’ ( NACRO , 1990 , p. 17 ) it may seem misguided and unnecessarily pedantic to take_-0.29 issue with the White Paper 's notion of punishment ."
"alp-fragment01","27","Punishment is just a word after all : nothing more than convenient political rhetoric meriting only lip-service_0.081 from probation managers and practitioners poised at the ‘ window_0.094 of opportunity ’ ."
"alp-fragment01","28","However , this fails to acknowledge a fundamental axiom of social work practice ; namely that language not only reflects_0.441 but also shapes_-0.176 social reality ."
"alp-fragment01","29","As Davies ( 1981 ) has pointed_0.083 out , speech is the basic tool_-0.226 of the social worker ."
"alp-fragment01","30","What we say influences what we think and in turn_-0.265 , what we do ."
"alp-fragment01","31","If punishment is assimilated_0.5 into the probation glossary it will inevitably influence the sort of practice the Service undertakes_0.167 ."
"alp-fragment01","32","In the sections_0.061 to follow_-0.194 the stark_-0.061 question is therefore put_-0.242 ‘ Is the Probation Service in the business of inflicting pain_-0.355 ? ’ and the answer which unfolds_0.059 may be summarized ‘ No , because it neither aspires_0.194 nor wishes_0.152 to ! ’"
"alp-fragment01","33","THE PROJECT : MORE DEMANDING_0.097 THAN PUNISHMENT"
"alp-fragment01","34","Government concern about the problem of drink-related offending is as old as the Probation Service ."
"alp-fragment01","35","Indeed , as Bochel ( 1976 ) has shown_0.031 , the establishment of a Probation Service in England and Wales was inextricably linked_0.118 with work undertaken with offenders in trouble through drink ."
"alp-fragment01","36","Almost a century later the new approach_-0.029 to punishment in the community outlined_0.094 by the White Paper once again presents_0.091 alcohol misuse as a key problem requiring community-based intervention ."
"alp-fragment01","37","‘ Alcohol ’ , the White Paper states_-0.088 , ‘ is implicated in a wide_-0.219 variety of crimes , drunken driving , offences of public disorder and domestic violence ’ ( p. 21 , para. 4. 14 ) ."
"alp-fragment01","38","In describing_-0.206 its vision_0.182 of effective supervision the White Paper goes_-0.531 on to note_-0.088 :"
"alp-fragment01","39","offenders take_-0.588 part_-0.139 in alcohol education programmes so that they can learn to drink sensibly ."
"alp-fragment01","40","They learn about the relative strength_-0.059 of different drinks , the amount which is safe to consume , and the pitfalls to avoid ( e.g. competitive drinking and buying ‘ rounds_0.188 ’ ) ( p. 37 , para. 7.11 ) ."
"alp-fragment01","41","As a summary of alcohol education programmes , this is something of a simplification ."
"alp-fragment01","42","However it does provide_0 a useful introduction_0.162 to the origins of the Alcohol Education Course_-0.257 reported here ."
"alp-fragment01","43","Furthermore , it highlights_0.161 the suitability of referring to this type of project for testing_0.091 out the appropriateness of applying_0 the notion of punishment to probation practice ."
"alp-fragment01","44","In 1985 the management of Somerset Probation Service was faced_-0.086 with the fact that nearly one in three of the offenders supervised in their area were either known to be or suspected of misusing alcohol ( Singer , 1985 ) ."
"alp-fragment01","45","Aware of practitioners ' frustration in not being able to work effectively with these problematic clients , Probation management_0.057 , in partnership with the voluntary sector_0.114 , determined to develop an Alcohol Education Course_-0.152 ( AEC ) ."
"alp-fragment01","46","By 1986 , when social inquiry report monitoring information covering_-0.031 1,257 offenders indicated that the problem of drink-related offending was virtually as great for pre- as for post-sentence clients , that is , alcohol was cited as a pre-offence problem in twenty-nine per cent of cases , a specialist project worker had been appointed ."
"alp-fragment01","47","Towards the end_-0.333 of 1986 an AEC was launched_0.2 and has been running_-0.212 ever since ."
"alp-fragment01","48","The aim_-0.03 of the course_0.086 is to educate offenders about alcohol to facilitate a lasting change in their subsequent use of this drug ."
"alp-fragment01","49","This aim_-0.121 is underpinned_0.324 by three interrelated objectives and it is not without significance_0.176 how they complement and serve_-0.03 to implement the White Paper 's own trinity of ‘ aims_0.059 of supervision ’ , that is , protection of the public , prevention of reoffending and successful reintegration of the offender in the community ( p. 35 , para. 7.3 ) ."
"alp-fragment01","50","These were :"
"alp-fragment01","51","1 ."
"alp-fragment01","52","To increase_0.03 knowledge about alcohol so that future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent ."
"alp-fragment01","53","2 ."
"alp-fragment01","54","To instil or reinforce_0.265 responsible drinking attitudes_0.273 and behaviour ."
"alp-fragment01","55","3 ."
"alp-fragment01","56","To encourage_0.059 the maintenance_0.382 of , or , where appropriate , a reduction to a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake ."
"alp-fragment01","57","To meet_-0.353 these objectives the AEC has a structured programme involving group and individual contact_0 , that is , six group sessions sandwiched_0.323 between one-to-one interviews held_-0.235 immediately before and after the group ."
"alp-fragment01","58","The initial one-to-one meeting , held_-0.333 with one of the two group leaders , serves_-0.219 to clarify what participants can expect from the course_0.029 and what is expected of them ."
"alp-fragment01","59","A standard_-0.114 contract which covers_0.061 conditions of attendance and an agreement to complete various assignments between group sessions is signed by each participant ."
"alp-fragment01","60","The final interview entails_0.091 a personalized review of the course_0.062 , as well as the formulation_0.364 of a follow-up plan_-0.441 to be undertaken with the offender 's supervising officer ."
"alp-fragment01","61","The course_-0.235 employs_0.059 a variety of materials_0 and techniques including the use of checklists , magazine and newspaper clippings , quizzes , videos , brainstorm exercises_0.118 , discussions , drink diaries , and role plays ( Menary , 1986 ) ."
"alp-fragment01","62","The AEC is primarily intended for young adults subject to a probation order_-0.125 with a special condition of attendance ( Schedule 11 4A(II) Criminal Justice Act 1982 ) and reflects_-0.133 the fact that most Somerset offenders in trouble through drink commit_-0.059 serious_-0.118 offences and/or possess a substantial_0.147 number of previous convictions ."
"alp-fragment01","63","In short , they are seriously at risk of committing_0 further_-0.182 offences and becoming trapped in the revolving_0.469 door_-0.118 of custody ."
"alp-fragment01","64","The development of the Somerset AEC both accords with and constitutes a practical example of the Home Office 's recent guidance to sentencers :"
"alp-fragment01","65","In recent years the probation service has devoted increasing resources_-0.029 to supervising_0.029 the more serious_-0.125 and persistent offenders ."
"alp-fragment01","66","Probation orders_-0.029 which are combined_0.118 with constructive_-0.057 , disciplined and effective programmes of supervision are increasingly being used for offenders who stand_0.108 to receive custodial sentences ( 1990b , p. 35 ) ."
"alp-fragment01","67","From the description_-0.057 of the AEC already given_-0.529 the demanding_0.364 and disciplined nature_-0.029 of the course_0.088 can be appreciated ."
"alp-fragment01","68","However , the course_0.176 is not punitive ; it is not concerned_0.094 with the infliction of pain_-0.176 ."
"alp-fragment01","69","Instead , it is concerned_-0.088 with the establishment of rules_-0.235 ."
"alp-fragment01","70","This is plainly_0.029 evident from the section_-0.212 of the contract signed by each participant where what is expected of them is spelt_0.303 out :"
"alp-fragment01","71","You will be expected to keep a drink diary throughout the course_-0.029 , and make_-0.333 attempts at reducing the amount you drink if it is greater than accepted healthy drinking levels ."
"alp-fragment01","72","You must be willing to be helped and help others — your experiences will be useful to other group members_0.265 ."
"alp-fragment01","73","You must attend 8 sessions ( these will consist of : an introductory session , six group sessions and a final assessment interview ) ."
"alp-fragment01","74","You must not drink before the session ."
"alp-fragment01","75","You must be on time — lateness will count_-0.294 as an absence ."
"alp-fragment01","76","Unlike the prison inmate , AEC participants can not sit_-0.394 back and passively do their time ."
"alp-fragment01","77","Probation practice is not , however , solely concerned_0.265 with the establishment of rules_0.032 ."
"alp-fragment01","78","As has been demonstrated elsewhere with regard to the generic probation setting_0.212 ( Singer , 1989 ) , the supervision of offenders involves two overarching aims_-0.088 : namely support_-0.029 and surveillance ."
"alp-fragment01","79","Support_-0.061 refers to anything which is said or done to help the offender solve or mitigate their personal or social problems : surveillance to anything which is said or done to induce the offender to conform to socially acceptable standards_-0.059 of behaviour ."
"alp-fragment01","80","These aims_0 are implemented through the practice of four distinguishable but related methods ."
"alp-fragment01","81","In terms of support_-0.088 , there is counselling and assisting : in terms of surveillance , there is directing and monitoring ."
"alp-fragment01","82","Each of these four methods are employed_0.206 during the eight sessions ."
"alp-fragment01","83","Although summarized as an alcohol education course_0 , the sessions are not just concerned_0.161 with giving_-0.333 information but also with enabling participants to make_-0.286 practical use of it ."
"alp-fragment01","84","In the first group session the counselling method is registered in the course_0.061 tutor 's notes ( Menary , 1986 ) by the explanation : ‘ This session aims_0 to get_-0.457 participants to consider the subject_-0.114 of alcohol in ways_-0.4 they had not thought of in the past ’ ( p. 3 ) ."
"alp-fragment01","85","During this session the importance of monitoring is also emphasized_0.125 :"

"alp-fragment01","87","In the fifth group session entitled ‘ Focus_0.032 on the Individual ’ , the counselling and the monitoring combine with the directing and assisting methods ."
"alp-fragment01","88","At the start of the session the tutor 's notes make_-0.029 clear_-0.212 that directing_0.265 extends_0 beyond enforcing the conditions of attendance :"

"alp-fragment01","90","The aim_0.212 at the end_-0.412 of the session is to encourage participants to make_-0.441 rules for their future drinking which will lead_-0.059 to a lessening of identified problems ( p. 4 ) ."
"alp-fragment01","91","Similarly , the assisting extends_0.176 beyond simply providing handouts of useful information :"
"alp-fragment01","92","It is important that participants are provided with the skills to reduce_-0.029 their drinking levels or handle_-0.03 more effectively ‘ pub centred ’ problems ."
"alp-fragment01","93","The use of role play , incorporating previously discussed difficulties ( i.e. homework assignment session 4 ) in ‘ real ’ or set_-0.143 up situations_-0.059 provides an opportunity for testing these skills ."
"alp-fragment01","94","Probably the best illustration_0.25 of the assisting method in action during the course_0.152 comes_-0.618 in the fifth session when Somerset practitioners take_-0.333 the logic of working with the problem in the community to its ultimate conclusion ."

"alp-fragment01","96","The counselling , assisting , directing , and monitoring on the AEC give_-0.351 substance_0.161 to the aims_0.273 of support_-0.032 and surveillance and provide the basis for establishing a model_0.088 of probation practice ."
"alp-fragment01","97","Punishment has no place_-0.206 in this model_-0.059 ."

"amm-fragment02","1594","In this chapter some of the ways_-0.147 in which palaeontologists determine the way_-0.303 fossil animals lived are described , reanimating_0.636 the dead fragments to build_0.324 up a living_-0.088 creature_0.143 ."
"amm-fragment02","1595","Since popular ideas of life in the past are often founded_0.235 on vividly_0.444 coloured_0.281 reconstructions_0.371 of ‘ The World in the Jurassic Period ’ and the like , it is important to remember that these imaginative scenes_0.094 are all inferences from bones , and similar fragments ."
"amm-fragment02","1596","In fact there is nothing fixed_0.03 about such interpretations , because the way_-0.472 the fossils are understood may change_-0.265 over the years , but it is usually some time before new discoveries percolate_0.206 into the popular presentations ."
"amm-fragment02","1597","Even the most solid-looking dinosaurs may have changed_-0.152 their habits_0.152 in the last few years !"
"amm-fragment02","1598","Many different lines_-0.062 of evidence may be used to flesh out the bare bones of the fossils ."
"amm-fragment02","1599","The first of these is the evidence of the rocks from which the remains were recovered ."
"amm-fragment02","1600","The sediments themselves reveal_0 much about the environment of deposition , as was shown_-0.294 in Chapter 3 ."
"amm-fragment02","1601","It is important to establish whether the fossil animal actually lived in the environment which furnished_0.273 its sedimentary cover , or whether its remains were swept_0.125 in from some other place ."
"amm-fragment02","1602","Fortunately it is usually easy to spot such intruders_0.25 ."
"amm-fragment02","1603","The type of sediment and the associated fossils will show_-0.25 whether the environment was marine , freshwater or terrestrial , providing the basic information into which the ecology of the animal has to be accommodated_0.355 ."
"amm-fragment02","1604","The sediments themselves may have preserved_0.206 some of the tracks left by the animal ( p. 20 ) to give_-0.286 direct_-0.143 evidence of its past activities_-0.065 ."
"amm-fragment02","1605","From the tracks alone it is possible to be certain of the bipedal stance_0.171 of certain dinosaurs , and to measure their stride_0.088 ."
"amm-fragment02","1606","The character_-0.121 of the rocks , and their setting in the past geography at the time when they accumulated , diagnoses_0.235 the climatic setting in which the extinct fauna lived , and climate imposes_0.273 certain restraints_0.229 on possible modes of life ."
"amm-fragment02","1607","Savannah animals differ from those of tropical rain forests , and these again from inhabitants_0.2 of the tundra at high_0.032 latitudes ."
"amm-fragment02","1608","Looking at the fossil animal itself , the first necessity is to reconstruct it as accurately as possible from its fragmentary remains ."
"amm-fragment02","1609","Sometimes this is a very complex business , particularly for vertebrates with numbers of small bones ."
"amm-fragment02","1610","To proceed_0.059 from the reconstruction_0.353 to an assessment_0 of probable life habits_0.062 two different but complementary approaches_-0.03 are used ."
"amm-fragment02","1611","One method attempts_-0.206 to compare the structures of teeth or limbs or some other feature of the extinct animal with living analogues ."
"amm-fragment02","1612","These do not have to be biologically related_0.182 organisms ."
"amm-fragment02","1613","The basic argument is that structures that are closely_-0.061 similar were probably adapted to a similar function ."
"amm-fragment02","1614","Sometimes these similarities are quite obvious : the ferocious_0.25 teeth of a predatory dinosaur are a sure indication of hunting habits_0.029 , with hardly a glance at the fangs of living mammalian carnivores ."
"amm-fragment02","1615","But the structure and functioning of grinding or chewing teeth in other mammals , in which opposing_0.294 teeth co-operate_0.176 in action , and which can be matched in extinct , unrelated_0.147 mammals , is a much more subtle matter , involving detailed studies on the operation of living dental systems to help elucidate the functioning of fossil ones ."
"amm-fragment02","1616","The technique of ‘ hunt_-0.29 the analogue ’ is a favourite one practised by palaeontologists , but it is certainly not a foolproof one , because there are many fossil animals that defy_0.139 comparison with living organisms , and some analogues do not stand_0.029 up to detailed scrutiny ."
"amm-fragment02","1617","The second method tries_-0.303 to analyse the structure of the fossil almost as if it were a piece_0.059 of engineering_0.375 ."
"amm-fragment02","1618","If the fossil is constructed in a certain way_-0.529 , then there are only a limited number of ‘ jobs_-0.219 ’ that the structure could perform_0.147 ."
"amm-fragment02","1619","The idea here_-0.424 is to decide which of the possibilities is the most likely one ."
"amm-fragment02","1620","This assumes_0.265 that nature only manufactures_0.375 efficient designs_0.29 ."
"amm-fragment02","1621","For the most part this is a reasonable assumption to make_-0.303 ."
"amm-fragment02","1622","Most animals today_-0.147 do seem to have bodies that accord_0.273 well with the functions they have to carry out to survive : flyers_0.294 are aerodynamically efficient , active swimmers_0.455 have suitable streamlining , herbivorous mammals have teeth appropriate for grinding plant food , and so on ."
"amm-fragment02","1623","Ideally one could construct a model of the fossil to test out these various functions in experiments , but the number of examples where the analysis has been pursued_0.229 this_-0.382 far_-0.375 are limited ."
"amm-fragment02","1624","Of course it can never be known whether the right answer_0.062 has been reached_-0.281 ( unless somebody dredges up a ‘ living fossil ’ from the depths of the ocean ) — there are only varying degrees of probability ."
"amm-fragment02","1625","But the best answers_-0.371 are probably obtained_-0.086 where the functional design_0 of the fossil points_0.029 to the same life habits_0.059 as a living analogue , and where both are consistent_0.229 with the geological circumstances in which the fossil remains occur ."
"amm-fragment02","1626","SWIMMING TRILOBITES"
"amm-fragment02","1627","There are thousands of different kinds of trilobites ."
"amm-fragment02","1628","All of them were marine and all of them are extinct ."
"amm-fragment02","1629","Since many kinds of trilobites co-existed at any one time they were probably occupying_0.059 different ecological niches_0.485 , behaving in different ways_-0.5 , corresponding with the wide_0.125 variation in shape that they show_-0.257 ."
"amm-fragment02","1630","We can use the methods described above_-0.088 to elucidate some of these occupations_0.176 , and get_-0.412 a glimpse_0.091 , albeit an imperfect one , of the trilobite as it lived ."
"amm-fragment02","1631","I will take_-0.618 an example where all the methods can be used , and where all point_0.118 in the same direction_0.152 , so that the answer_-0.083 is probably correct ."
"amm-fragment02","1632","Most trilobites were broadly oval-shaped being rather longer than wide , not greatly convex , and with eyes that occupy_0.312 perhaps a quarter of the length of the head ."
"amm-fragment02","1633","There are a few trilobite species , however , with enormous , globular eyes ( see below_0.061 ) ."
"amm-fragment02","1634","By examining the way_-0.571 these animals were put_-0.344 together_-0.258 it is possible to suggest a likely mode_0.152 of life ."
"amm-fragment02","1635","Giant-eyed Ordovician trilobite , seen from the top and side ."
"amm-fragment02","1636","Twice its natural size ."
"amm-fragment02","1637","Enlargement shows_-0.156 a section through the lenses to show_-0.194 the direction of the field_-0.206 of view ."
"amm-fragment02","1638","We can take_0.182 the eyes first ."
"amm-fragment02","1639","The trilobite eye was of a compound type , and each lens was made_-0.471 up of a calcite crystal ."
"amm-fragment02","1640","From the optical properties of this mineral we know that the lens was able_-0.485 to interpret_0.219 light coming_-0.258 from a direction more or less at right-angles to the lens surface ."
"amm-fragment02","1641","So we can deduce what the field_0.121 of vision of our globular-eyed trilobite was , by looking at the directions in which all the lenses face ."
"amm-fragment02","1642","It turns_-0.457 out that our animal was able_-0.559 to see in almost every direction — upwards , downwards , sideways and forwards , and even backwards , because the eyes bulged out beyond the line_0.118 of the rest of the body ."
"amm-fragment02","1643","Most other trilobites have a predominantly lateral field_-0.091 of view ."
"amm-fragment02","1644","If the animal lived on the sea bottom , it seems unlikely that it would have eye lenses specialized for looking downwards , and we begin to suspect_0.235 that the animal habitually_0.343 dwelt above the sea floor ."
"amm-fragment02","1645","Other features of its shape are consistent_0.212 with this ."
"amm-fragment02","1646","At the– edge of the eyes are a pair of long spines , and these point_0 downwards at a steep angle , at very awkward attitude for resting comfortably on the sea floor ."
"amm-fragment02","1647","Most ‘ normal ’ trilobites have a more or less horizontal rim around the forward margin , which may have rested on the sediment surface ."
"amm-fragment02","1648","The thorax of the large-eyed trilobite is remarkably long compared with the average trilobite ( compare Fig. 33 ) ."
"amm-fragment02","1649","The convex , middle part of the thorax contained the musculature that operated_0.062 the appendages ( which , as usual , are not preserved ) , and the relatively large volume of this region shows_-0.406 that the musculature was powerful ."
"amm-fragment02","1650","The construction of this giant-eyed trilobite suggests_-0.143 that it lived an actively swimming life well above the bottom , and possibly in the surface waters of the sea ."
"amm-fragment02","1651","Of course because there are no living trilobites we can not find_-0.382 direct_-0.147 confirmation of this hypothesis , but we can look_-0.417 for other arthropods that have the same modifications_0.455 of the eyes , for example , in the present day oceans ."
"amm-fragment02","1652","The analogy is found_-0.333 in such ocean-going amphipods ( a kind of ‘ shrimp ’ ) as Cystosoma , which also has enormously expanded eyes , looking like headlamps_0.294 , compared with its bottom-dwelling relatives_0.312 ( see above_0 ) ."

"amm-fragment02","1737","If it is correct that our trilobite lived above the sea bottom , actively swimming in the water , there are certain predictions we can make_-0.471 about its geological occurrence which can be tested by looking in the rocks ."

"amm-fragment02","1749","Active swimmers_-0.303 in the surface waters of the present_-0.088 oceans are likely to feed directly on the plankton , and the trilobites may have had a method of harvesting_0.382 large_-0.182 quantities of minute food ."

"amm-fragment02","1760","The sauropods have relatively long , pillar-like_0.163 legs , resembling those of the elephant , the largest living land animal , and may have been well adapted for supporting the huge bulk of the animal ."
"amm-fragment02","1761","The feet of the sauropod are small ( relatively speaking_-0.118 ! ) , with short , stubby toes , yet animals that walk on soft mud tend_0.176 to have spreading feet to distribute their weight more evenly ."

"amm-fragment02","1763","If the dinosaur did , after all , live on dry land , then the long neck could have usefully functioned to allow_-0.257 the animal to browse the high foliage of trees ( see p. 116 ) ."
"amm-fragment02","1764","It has been suggested that an animal of the size of Brachiosaurus could not have breathed under water because of the pressure on the lungs ."
"amm-fragment02","1765","Their fossil remains seem to occur with other animals and plants , which are generally accepted as terrestrial ."
"amm-fragment02","1766","There is even some evidence from the tracks they have left behind that Diplodocus and its allies_0.212 moved about in herds ."
"amm-fragment02","1767","They may have been the gigantic reptilian analogue of the elephant , and it may be no coincidence that the elephant also has its nasal openings on top of the skull , with the nostrils in this case sited_0.171 at the end of the trunk it has been suggested that some sauropods may have had a proboscis of some sort ."
"amm-fragment02","1768","The balance_0.097 of evidence seems to be swinging_0.485 away from the original idea of swamp-dwelling giant dinosaurs to fully terrestrial habits_0.065 ."
"amm-fragment02","1769","But other aspects_0.03 of the dinosaur living habits_-0.258 are still more strongly_0.133 debated ."
"amm-fragment02","1770","In the last few years a powerful_-0.029 controversy has arisen_0.382 over whether the dinosaurs as a whole were cold-blooded , like all living reptiles ( and there is no doubt that dinosaurs were reptiles ) , or warm-blooded , resembling mammals in this respect ."
"amm-fragment02","1771","Cold-blooded animals have to ‘ warm_-0.171 up ’ before they can be fully active ; that is why lizards and snakes bask in the sun in temperate climates_0.375 ."

"amm-fragment02","1773","Warm-blooded animals have the same body temperatures at all times , and can be more continuously_0.219 active , but they use_-0.562 far_-0.062 more energy — and hence need more food — than cold-blooded animals of the same size ."
"amm-fragment02","1774","The posture_0.121 of many dinosaurs , and particularly the carnivorous theropod dinosaurs , was fully erect with the legs beneath the body , and unlike the sprawling legs of living reptiles ( see p. 116 ) ."
"amm-fragment02","1775","The long back legs of such hunters_0 look highly suitable for running , and as they did so the long tail may have been held erect as a kind of counter-balance ( see p. 116 ) ."
"amm-fragment02","1776","For any kind of prolonged activity , warm-bloodedness would have been a distinct advantage ."
"amm-fragment02","1777","Under the microscope even the bone structure_0.333 of these dinosaurs looks more like that of living mammals than cold-blooded reptiles ."
"amm-fragment02","1778","On the other hand_-0.389 it can be argued that the sauropods like Brachiosaurus were so large , and with a relatively small surface area through which to cool compared with their enormous volume , that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to allow_0.029 them to sustain more continuous_0.125 activity than smaller , living reptiles ."
"amm-fragment02","1779","It has also been argued that the small mouths of the giants_0.324 simply could not have downed enough food to support_-0.121 a warm-blooded metabolism , particularly plant food that needs a lot of processing before it becomes available as energy ."
"amm-fragment02","1780","The armoured_0.118 or plated_0.438 dinosaurs include some species that seem too heavily burdened with protective armour_0.429 to have been very active , but this does not necessarily mean that they had to be cold-blooded ."

"amm-fragment02","1786","The point_0.059 is that birds themselves are warm-blooded , like mammals , and if birds and dinosaurs are as closely_-0.194 related as now seems likely , then it obviously increases the likelihood that the dinosaurs themselves may have been warm-blooded ."
"amm-fragment02","1787","The pros_0.03 and cons_-0.088 of this theory are the subject_0.029 of much contentious debate by experts , but it would probably be correct to say_-0.576 that the greater_0.031 number of specialists believe that at least the more bipedal of the dinosaurs , including small and large carnivores , were warm-blooded , active animals ."

"as6-fragment01","28","Harrison describes ( p. 369 ) the way_-0.424 in which the inner urban powder-keg leads_0.061 to a vicious_0.265 circle_-0.114 , with many victims_0.125 , but few individual villains_0.394 :"

"as6-fragment01","32","The inevitable sufferers , of course , are the poor , of whom those who actually commit_-0.057 the offences that concern the police are a tiny_0.206 minority and whom , indeed , it should be the purpose of the police to protect ."
"as6-fragment01","33","Not only are the most disadvantaged on the receiving_-0.4 end_-0.441 of most crime , argues Harrison , they also have to put up with the heaviest_0.206 police presence ."
"as6-fragment01","34","They are more likely to be stopped and searched , and to be the victim_0.182 of mistaken arrest or conviction ."
"as6-fragment01","35","At the same time , the residents of the poorest areas have to suffer_0 , in a way_-0.156 that is not true of those who live elsewhere , a growing_-0.471 fear of attack on themselves or their property ."

"as6-fragment01","38","And he concludes , ‘ of all the warnings that the inner city has to offer_-0.242 for the direction_-0.032 British society is taking_-0.176 , this is perhaps the most sinister ’ ."

"as6-fragment01","48","for the moment , however , the pattern_-0.139 of drug abuse in Britain remains as varied as ever — with home-produced_0.019 drugs such as amphetamines as serious_0.03 a problem as those that hit_-0.156 the headlines ."
"as6-fragment01","49","It is a symptom_-0.029 of public anxiety about urban squalor — and , less creditably , of class and racial prejudice — that ‘ drugs ’ and ‘ inner cities ’ are automatically_0.121 linked_0.156 in the popular consciousness_0.559 ( MacGregor , 1989a ) ."

"as6-fragment01","74","Despite the contemporary tone_0.062 of much of Action for Cities , the programme 's heritage can be traced_0.265 to the early 1960s studies which provided the basis for the 1965 Milner–Holland Report on housing and the 1967 Plowden Report on education , as a result of which general improvement areas and education priority areas were established ."

"as6-fragment01","90","The previous Government , however , had already pointed_0.161 to the need to revitalize_0.097 urban economies , and at first the shift was more rhetorical than real ."

"as6-fragment01","92","Partnership became his slogan — the partnership_0.303 of public and private brains and money ."
"as6-fragment01","93","A new Urban Development Grant was devised , to pump-prime with public funds schemes which would then attract_-0.176 private investment ."
"as6-fragment01","94","Heseltine 's vision_0.152 was of ‘ partnerships which recognise_-0.03 that there are some things_-0.031 that only governments can pay_0 for , but also that the ingenuity and flexibility_0.324 of the private sector_0.265 is indispensable ’ ( p. 156 ) ."
"as6-fragment01","95","He claims that serious_0 work on inner-city policy began in 1979 : but it was , undoubtedly , the riots of 1981 , coinciding with the biggest_-0.121 drop_-0.243 in employment and job vacancies since the war , which gave_-0.273 impetus_0.312 to the new_-0.324 approach_0.29 ."
"as6-fragment01","96","Urban Development Corporations were introduced in 1981 in London Docklands and Merseyside , and the Urban Development Grant came_-0.457 in late the following_-0.054 year ."
"as6-fragment01","97","Conservative instincts were , of course , to minimize_0.188 — within the ‘ partnership_0.4 — state involvement and expenditure , relative to that of private enterprise ."
"as6-fragment01","98","Yet , the irony of the early 1980s — as a deteriorating , but perennial , urban problem rapidly became the most acute aspect_0.206 of the crisis_-0.057 of mass unemployment — was that a Tory government , willy-nilly , found_-0.086 itself presiding over an increase in state intervention through a variety_0.056 of agencies ."
"as6-fragment01","99","The increased scale_0.121 of operations_0.176 also ushered_0.314 in another fashion of the 1980s — new_-0.588 management structures_0.206 ."
"as6-fragment01","100","Thus in 1985 City Action> Teams were introduced to each ‘ Inner City Partnership ’ area to co-ordinate_0.273 the work of the three government departments involved ."
"as6-fragment01","101","Task forces_0.226 , meanwhile , were directed_0.265 to tackle_0.212 youth unemployment ."
"as6-fragment01","102","By 1986/7 the Urban Programme was supporting_0.059 1,380 starter units and 400 business starts in enterprise workshops_0.424 ."
"as6-fragment01","103","It was providing 27,500 training_-0.088 places_-0.353 ( often in conjunction with the Manpower Services Commission ) : some 2,500 buildings were being improved ; estate action aimed_0.2 to tackle_0.152 run down housing ; and a large_-0.303 number of new_-0.576 ‘ partnerships ’ ( which some might see_-0.333 as subsidies , or discredited_0.324 regional grants , in a new_-0.29 guise ) were in operation_0.235 , in an effort to bring_-0.576 private investment to run-down urban areas ."
"as6-fragment01","104","By 1988 it was claimed that £200 million of Urban Development Grant and Urban Regeneration_0.438 Grant had successfully ‘ levered_0.343 ’ more than £800 million of private investment into the inner cities ( although how much of the latter sum might have been invested in any case is difficult to say_-0.382 ) ."
"as6-fragment01","105","Meanwhile , there were other incentive schemes — Enterprise Zones , for example , and simplified Planning Zones , which aimed_0.242 to lift_0.057 tax and planning ‘ barriers_0.139 ’ in order to facilitate investment ."
"as6-fragment01","106","Indeed , while with one hand_-0.062 trying to hold_-0.229 down expenditure by local authorities , the Government found_-0.152 itself by the late 1980s involved with the other hand_0.059 in massive_0.057 ear-marked spending on inner urban areas ."
"as6-fragment01","107","The Department of the Environment alone by 1988 was spending_-0.094 half a billion pounds out of an Action for Cities total , involving most Home_-0.088 departments , estimated at £3 billion ."
"as6-fragment01","108","Perhaps a Labour government would have spent_0.065 even more : it would certainly have spent_-0.371 it in different ways_-0.382 ."
"as6-fragment01","109","It is a curious_0.143 comment on Thatcherism , however , that the administration most committed_0.125 to a reduction_0.188 in the role_-0.485 of the state , and in the need for an independent_0 private sector_0.091 , has spent_-0.088 more on specific urban regeneration_0.5 and employment schemes and incentives to private investment in urban areas than any other in recent history ."
"as6-fragment01","110","One of the most bizarre aspects_-0.091 of government policy has been the effective murder_0.382 of the voluntary sector_0.176 , and its appropriation_0.419 , by subterfuge , into the Tory version_0.364 of the corporate state ."
"as6-fragment01","111","Conservatives have always lauded the ‘ voluntarist ’ principle in welfare , and encouraged_0.114 it from platforms_0.143 ."
"as6-fragment01","112","Faced_-0.152 , however , with the catastrophic_0.235 increase in unemployment and the need to occupy_0.147 large_-0.25 numbers of workless people without directly_-0.059 employing them ( which would have run_-0.545 counter_0.353 to the economic doctrine which had led_-0.147 to the redundancy of many of them in the first place_-0.471 ) , the Government poured_0.059 money into any ‘ voluntary ’ agency willing_-0.121 to put_-0.394 in a bid for government-funded cheap labour ."
"as6-fragment01","113","One result was the triumphant_0.455 expansion_0 of some charitable_0 organizations , which rejoiced_0.444 both at their new-found importance and at the Government 's munificence ."
"as6-fragment01","114","Another was the transformation of many such bodies_0.152 , already heavily_0.344 subsidized from public funds , into de facto agencies of the state , which financed_0 them and indirectly determined_-0.061 their policy ."
"as6-fragment01","115","Nowhere was the impact_0.171 of this clumsy_0.281 sleight_0.515 of hand_-0.121 more evident than in the inner cities , where voluntary organizations had been most active , and where the Government was most anxious_-0.118 for them to mop_0.03 up unemployment ."
"as6-fragment01","116","However , the later withdrawal_0.094 of government support_0.176 , with the scrapping_0.424 of the Community Programme as unemployment receded_0.441 , left_0.029 many of these voluntary organizations high_-0.212 and dry_-0.062 ."
"as6-fragment01","117","The National Council for Voluntary Organizations ( NCVO ) has suggested_-0.031 from a recent survey_-0.182 that around_-0.061 3,000 projects had been affected and had lost_-0.394 £285 million in funding ( MacGregor , 1990 ) ."
"as6-fragment01","118","There was , of course , a crucial element_0.097 in the Government 's anxiety_0.242 : the high_-0.065 concentration of ethnic minorities in the areas of concern ."
"as6-fragment01","119","In 1981 nearly 40 per cent of ethnic minorities in the UK lived in ‘ partnership ’ or ‘ programme ’ areas ."
"as6-fragment01","120","There is a danger_0.171 in reading back from this figure another stereotype , similar to the Pavlovian ‘ drug addiction/inner city ’ assumed_0.206 link_0.118 ."
"as6-fragment01","121","Some urban areas have serious_0 problems without a major ethnic dimension_0.194 ( Newcastle , Teesside ) ; not all members_-0.03 of ethnic minorities are poor or deprived ."
"as6-fragment01","122","Nevertheless , the high proportion of inner urban populations composed of people from ethnic minorities , and the high incidence among these groups of all the indices of poverty and social and environmental hardship — combined with the specific problem of inter-racial rivalry , harassment , and tension — make race and ethnicity an aspect that is central to any analysis of the inner cities and of any ameliorative approach ."
"as6-fragment02","349","MAKING_-0.182 SENSE_0.029 OF THE 1981 RIOTS"
"as6-fragment02","350","Reactions_-0.029 to the riots have concentrated_0.182 on a number_-0.343 of key variables that are said to characterize the localities in which the riots have occurred ."
"as6-fragment02","351","Lord Scarman 's report on the 1981 disorders_0.147 highlighted_0.212 the importance of unemployment , urban deprivation , racial disadvantage , relations between young blacks and the police , the decline of civic consent , and political exclusion as the key issues ."
"as6-fragment02","352","Other reactions_-0.061 have concentrated_0.118 on the issue of the interplay_0.242 between inner-city decay_0.294 and racial disadvantage in contemporary Britain ."
"as6-fragment02","353","Yet others have argued that the unrest can be seen_-0.387 as a symptom_0 of the breakdown_0.206 of law and order_0.2 in British society ( Gaffney , 1987 ; Hall , 1987 ; Keith , 1987 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","354","The main issues that were prominent_0.412 in debates during 1980–1 were ‘ race ’ and ‘ law and order_0 ’ ."
"as6-fragment02","355","This was by no means an accident , since throughout the 1970s a powerful_0.091 body_-0.161 of media , political , and academic opinion had been constructed_0.364 around the theme of how Britain was drifting_0.273 into a ‘ violent society ’ , and how the basis of consent was being shifted_-0.029 by the pressures_0.152 of immigration and the growth_-0.061 of multi-racial inner city areas ."
"as6-fragment02","356","A glimpse_0.206 of the impact_0.171 of the 1980–1 riots at this level_0.03 can be achieved through two important debates in Parliament ."
"as6-fragment02","357","The first took_-0.029 place_-0.242 in the midst_0.375 of the July 1981 riots , and had as its theme : ‘ Civil Disturbances ’ ."
"as6-fragment02","358","The tone_0.032 of the debate was set_-0.364 by Home Secretary William Whitelaw 's introductory statement in which he spoke of ( a ) the need to ‘ remove_-0.469 the scourge_0.176 of criminal violence from our streets ’ , and ( b ) the urgency of developing ‘ policies designed_0.059 to promote_0.088 the mutual tolerance and understanding upon which the whole_-0.143 future of a free democratic society depends ’ ( Hansard , vol. 8 , 16 July 1981 : col. 1405 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","359","The ‘ scourge_0.514 of criminal violence ’ was , Whitelaw argued , a danger to the whole_-0.212 framework_0.147 of consent and legality on which the political institutions of British society were based_0.062 ."
"as6-fragment02","360","In reply Roy Hattersley supported_-0.097 the call_-0.394 for the immediate suppression_0.406 of street violence , but warned that the roots_0.147 of such riots could not be dealt with until all people felt_-0.412 they had a stake_0.029 in British society ( ibid. : cols. 1407–9 )"
"as6-fragment02","361","The second debate took_-0.533 place_-0.147 on 26 November 1981 , on the publication of the Scarman Report , and had as its theme : ‘ Law and Order_-0.152 ’ ."
"as6-fragment02","362","The importance of the riots in pushing_-0.029 the law and order_-0.031 issue , and specifically policing , on to the main political agenda was emphasized_0.375 by the Liberal leader , David Steel , who argued that ‘ urgent action ’ to prevent a drift_0 into lawlessness was necessary from both a moral and a political perspective_0.03 ( Hansard , vol. 13 , 26 November 1981 : cols. 1009–11 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","363","A subsequent debate on the same issue in March 1982 was also full_-0.206 of references to the experience of 1981 , the impact_0.031 of street violence , crime , decaying_0.353 urban conditions , the breakdown_0.118 of consent between the police and many local communities , and the spectre_0.545 of ‘ more violence to come ’ if changes in both policing tactics_0.265 and social policy were not swiftly_0.059 introduced ( Hansard , vol. 20 , 25 March 1982 : cols. 1107–81 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","364","The need to support_-0.143 the police was accepted by both the Labour and the Conservative speakers in the parliamentary debate on the riots , and was established as a benchmark for the official response_0.029 to the riots long_-0.059 before the Scarman Report was published in November 1981 ."
"as6-fragment02","365","Any substantive disagreement centred_0 around the issue of what role_-0.029 social deprivation and unemployment had in bringing_0.059 young people to protest violently on the streets ."
"as6-fragment02","366","Intermingled with the discourses about race and law and order_-0.182 were constant_0.2 references to unemployment , particularly among the young , and various forms_0 of social disadvantage and poverty ( Solomos , 1988 , pp. 186–911 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","367","Throughout 1980 and 1981 debates about the riots in the media , in Parliament , and in various official reports hinged_0.324 around the interrelationship between racial , law-and-order , and social factors_-0.118 ."
"as6-fragment02","368","The importance of this debate can be explained , partly , by the political capital_0.147 which the Opposition could make_-0.235 from linking_-0.091 the social and economic malaise_0.375 of the country at large with violent street disturbances ."
"as6-fragment02","369","Conversely , throughout this period Government Ministers strenuously denied that unemployment and social deprivation were significant causes of urban unrest ."
"as6-fragment02","370","Although the Scarman Report is often taken_0.028 to be the central_0.125 text which argues_-0.057 for a link_-0.219 between ‘ social conditions ’ and ‘ disorder_0.206 ’ , the terms of the debate were by no means set_-0.206 by Scarman ."
"as6-fragment02","371","During both April and July 1981 vigorous_0.235 exchanges_0.147 took_-0.469 place_-0.212 in the press and in Parliament about the role_-0.091 that deteriorating social conditions and unemployment may have played_-0.265 in bringing about the riots ."
"as6-fragment02","372","During the 16 July parliamentary debate on ‘ Civil Disturbances ’ , Roy Hattersley 's formulation_0.294 of this linkage_0.441 provided a useful summary of the ‘ social conditions ’ argument ."
"as6-fragment02","373","After some preliminary remarks about the Labour party 's support_-0.152 for the police , he went on to outline_-0.176 his opposition to the view_-0.353 of the riots as essentially anti-police outbursts :"
"as6-fragment02","374","I repeat that l do not believe that the principal cause of last week 's riots was the conduct of the police ."
"as6-fragment02","375","It was the conditions of deprivation and despair in the decaying_0.276 areas of our old cities — areas in which the Brixton and Toxteth riots took_-0.531 place_-0.235 , and areas from which the skinhead invaders_0.03 of Southall come ."
"as6-fragment02","376","( Hansard , vol. 8 , 16 July 1981 : col. 1408 )"
"as6-fragment02","377","Much of the subsequent controversy about this analysis centred_0.152 on the question of youth unemployment ."
"as6-fragment02","378","Hattersley had suggested that the riots were a ‘ direct_-0.152 product_0.226 ’ of high levels_0.125 of youth unemployment , and a furious debate ensued in both Parliament and the media about this assertion ."
"as6-fragment02","379","The final symbolic cue_0.312 used to make_-0.323 sense_-0.114 of the 1980–1 protests is more difficult to categorize , but its basic meaning can be captured_0.394 by the term ‘ political marginality ’ ."
"as6-fragment02","380","While a number_-0.125 of discussions of the roots_0.114 of urban unrest in the United States have noted_-0.212 the salience of political marginality in determining participation in violent protests ( Skolnick , 1969 ; Fogelson , 1971 ; Edelman , 1971 ; Knopf , 1975 ) , this issue has received_-0.2 relatively little attention in Britain ."
"as6-fragment02","381","Nevertheless , during the 1980–1 events and their aftermath the political context_0.441 was discussed from a number_0.029 of perspectives_0.088 ."
"as6-fragment02","382","The Scarman Report , for example , located_0.088 part_-0.29 of the explanation for the riots in the feelings of alienation and powerlessness_0.531 which were experienced by young blacks living in depressed_0.265 inner-city areas ."
"as6-fragment02","383","A successful policy for tackling_0.375 the roots_0.176 of urban disorder_0.03 was seen_-0.324 as one which sought_-0.242 to involve all the community in dealing with the problems of each area so that they could come_-0.094 to feel_-0.324 that they have a stake_0.065 in its future ( Scarman , 1981 , para. 6.42 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","384","Where such arguments did not fit in with the overarching themes of race , violence and disorder_0.091 , and social deprivation they were either sidelined_0.206 or pushed_0.2 into the sub-clauses of official reports ."
"as6-fragment02","385","The Scarman Report , for example , contained_0 the following policy proposal : ‘ I recommend that local communities must be fully and effectively involved in planning_-0.029 , in the provision of local services , and in the management and financing of specific projects , ( Scarman , 1981 , para. 8.44 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","386","Such a move_-0.219 towards greater_0 political integration was seen_-0.394 by Lord Scarman as essential if the gap_0.097 between inner-city residents and the forces_-0.03 of law and order_0.088 was to be bridged_0.091 ."
"as6-fragment02","387","But the concern with overcoming_0.097 political marginality remained_-0.086 on the sidelines_0.424 of the main public debate because it questioned_-0.152 the perception of the rioters as driven_0.156 by irrational , uncivilized , and criminal instincts ."
"as6-fragment02","388","This did not , however , stop_-0.324 the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policies from being raised_-0.152 at all , as can be seen_-0.286 subsequently by the attempts after 1981 to introduce both locally and nationally measures_0.258 which were meant to address_-0.121 some of the grievances of the rioters and to ensure that further disturbances did not occur ."
"as6-fragment02","389","Aspects_0.303 of these measures_0.281 are considered further_0 on in the chapter ."
"as6-fragment02","390","PERSPECTIVES_-0.057 ON THE 1985 RIOTS"
"as6-fragment02","391","Despite widespread predictions of further unrest in the aftermath of 1981 , the scale_0.029 and the location of the 1985 riots seem to have surprised even some of the most astute commentators ."
"as6-fragment02","392","Handsworth , for example , was presented_0.242 even shortly before September 1985 as a ‘ success story ’ in terms of police — community relations ."
"as6-fragment02","393","The outbreak of violence in this area was therefore widely presented_0.118 as an aberration ."
"as6-fragment02","394","Similarly the spread_0.067 of violence in London to areas such as the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham was seen_-0.344 as a break_-0.029 from previous experience , which had centred_-0.029 on areas such as Brixton ."
"as6-fragment02","395","There are many continuities_0.455 between 1980–1 and 1985 in relation to the common-sense images_0.273 used in the press and television to cover_0.062 the events ."
"as6-fragment02","396","But responses_-0.167 in 1985 were different , at least in terms of degree_0.161 , and probably in relation to the extent_0.242 to which the riots were seen_-0.406 as a ‘ race ’ phenomenon by a wider_0 body_0.188 of opinion ."
"as6-fragment02","397","The ambiguities and sub-clauses to be found_-0.25 in much of the press coverage during 1980–1 had at least acted_-0.273 as a countervailing tendency against the more extreme forms_-0.118 of discourse which blamed_-0.152 the riots completely on black people ."
"as6-fragment02","398","During the 1985 riots and their immediate aftermath , the imagery_0.394 of ‘ race ’ was used_-0.375 by sections_-0.065 of the press without the sense_-0.242 of ambiguity which could still be found_-0.118 in 1980–1 ."
"as6-fragment02","399","The ‘ silence over race ’ was breached_0.303 in 1980–1 , but in 1985 debate about racial issues was taken_-0.438 a step_-0.212 further_-0.094 ."
"as6-fragment02","400","Peregrine Worsthorne , for example , used the ferocity of the confrontations in Handsworth , Brixton , and Tottenham to argue that there was a major question_-0.057 mark_-0.206 over the possibility of assimilating the ‘ coloured_0.188 population ’ into mainstream ‘ British values ’ ( Sunday Telegraph , 29 September 1985 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","401","To be sure there was still a strong_-0.306 response_-0.212 opposing Enoch Powell 's call_-0.147 for repatriation , from all shades_0.312 of political opinion , but the racialization of public debate about the 1985 riots went_-0.515 much further_-0.152 than 1980–1 ."
"as6-fragment02","402","In this context_-0.188 it was the externality_0.212 of British Afro-Caribbeans and Asians which was highlighted_0.194 rather the racist institutions and processes which worked_0.059 against blacks at all levels_-0.065 of society ."
"as6-fragment02","403","The usage of ‘ race ’ during the September-October 1985 period took_-0.118 on new meanings , which had little if anything to do with the impact_0.031 of racism as such , since the emphasis_0.029 was on the cultural characteristics of the minority communities themselves ."
"as6-fragment02","404","After Handsworth part_-0.094 of the press response_0.031 was to blame the riot on rivalry between West Indians and Asians , and even after the arguments were criticized by local residents ; and community leaders , they were used to ‘ explain ’ ' what happened ."
"as6-fragment02","405","In addition , the question whether the cultures and values of the black communities , their family structures_0.212 , and their political attitudes_0.235 ‘ bred_0.171 violence ’ was constantly raised_0.088 ( van Dijk , 1988 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","406","The actual facts ' of who was arrested during the riots , whether black or white , were hardly debated since it was assumed_-0.094 that they were mostly black and mostly unemployed and involved with crime ( Keith , 1987 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","407","The imagery_0.147 of the ‘ black bomber , used in Handsworth was extended_-0.059 to the notion that there were groups of alienated and criminalized young blacks who saw_-0.412 the riots as a chance to engage_0.032 in an ‘ orgy_0.344 of looting ’ ."
"as6-fragment02","408","The Dear Report on Handsworth captures_0.125 this image_-0.029 and links_0 it to the social condition of young blacks :"
"as6-fragment02","409","The majority of rioters who took_-0.424 part in these unhappy_-0.062 events were young , black and Afro-Caribbean origin_0.088 ."
"as6-fragment02","410","Let_-0.171 there be no doubt , these young criminals are not in any way_-0.469 representative of the vast_0 majority of the Afro-Caribbean community whose life has contributed_-0.265 to the life and culture of the West Midlands over many years and whose hopes and aspirations are at one with those of every other law-abiding citizen ."
"as6-fragment02","411","We share_-0.194 a common sorrow_0.094 ."
"as6-fragment02","412","It is the duty of us all to ensure that an entire cultural group is not tainted_0.031 by the actions of a criminal minority ."
"as6-fragment02","413","( Dear , 1985 , p. 69 )"
"as6-fragment02","414","This ‘ black ’ criminal minority was constructed_0.219 not only into the leading force_0 behind the riots , but sometimes as the only force ."
"as6-fragment02","415","Indeed , throughout September and October 1985 , and during the following months , the imagery_0.343 of race continued_-0.156 to dominate_0.258 debate about both the causes and the policy outcomes of the riots ."
"as6-fragment02","416","As pointed_-0.129 out earlier , the ‘ social causes ’ argument was another major plank_0.219 of public debate about the 1980–1 riots , particularly in relation to the highly politicized issue of unemployment ."
"as6-fragment02","417","During 1985 this issue was raised_0.121 once again , though by then the extent_0.059 of mass unemployment and urban de-industrialization and decay_0.242 was more stark_0.471 than it had been in 198l ."
"as6-fragment02","418","Images_-0.152 of ‘ urban decay_0.324 ’ , ‘ tinderbox_0.5 cities ’ , and ‘ ghetto_0.294 streets ’ linked_0.242 up with the images_-0.121 of ‘ race inequality ’ and ‘ black_0.061 ghettos_0.344 ’ to produce_-0.091 an analysis more complex but also more contradictory ."
"as6-fragment02","419","An interesting mixture_0.118 of the various images_-0.081 was provided by a story in the Daily Telegraph under the headline : ‘ Broadwater Farm : Like the Divis_0.387 Flats_0.152 with Reggae_0.412 ’ ( 8 October 1985 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","420","The Mirror described_-0.086 the estate as ‘ Living_-0.176 Hell_0.121 ’ , and quoted_0 one resident as saying that ‘ You 've no idea how awful daily life is ’ ( 8 October 1985 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","421","Such images_0.091 were reworkings of arguments already used about Toxteth in 1981 and Brixton in 1981 , but they were used more widely than in 1980–1 ."
"as6-fragment02","422","Even the Daily Mail , which deployed_0.324 the clearest_0.206 use_-0.242 of ‘ race ’ and ‘ outside_0 agitator ’ arguments , ran_-0.182 a major story on Broadwater Farm under the headline : ‘ Burnt-out_0.161 hulks_0.265 litter_0.088 this concrete jungle_0.312 … despair hangs_0.294 heavy_0.152 ’ ( 8 October 1985 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","423","A number_-0.059 of stories using such imagery_0.294 were run_-0.188 by both the quality and the popular press during this period , but similar arguments are to be found_-0.094 in parliamentary debates ( Hansard , vol. 84 , 21 October 1985 , cols. 30-.46 , 388 ) , and even in official reports produced by the police on the riots in Birmingham and London ."
"as6-fragment02","424","The ‘ cities of inner_0.273 despair ’ were conceived_0.2 as the breeding_0.057 ground_0.152 for disorderly_0.545 protest , and however hard_-0.229 the Government tried to break_-0.303 the causal link_0.206 between the two , it was forced_-0.129 to take_-0.367 on board_0.531 the need to restore_-0.097 order_-0.212 not only through the police but through promises of help for the inner cities ."
"as6-fragment02","425","Much as in 1980–1 , the ‘ social causes ’ argument can not be seen_-0.515 separately_0.031 from the broader_0.057 debate about the future of the British economy and society ."
"as6-fragment02","426","The Government 's record on unemployment was a heavily_0 politicized issue , and just as in 1981 it vehemently denied_-0.188 any responsibility for the riots through its pursuit_0.235 of free-market_0.059 policies ."
"as6-fragment02","427","But the Government did find_-0.294 a way_-0.394 of accepting a link_-0.324 between the riots and social problems without bringing_0 its main policies into the debate : namely by linking_0.212 the growth_0.086 of violent disorder_0.25 to crime and drugs ."
"as6-fragment02","428","The emphasis_0.235 on ‘ crime ’ and the ‘ criminal acts_-0.242 ’ of the rioters in the official responses_0.031 to the 1985 riots took_-0.235 a general and a specific form_-0.147 ."
"as6-fragment02","429","The general form_-0.03 relied_0.229 on the argument that the riots were not a form_-0.241 of protest against the insufferable social conditions of inner-city areas or the actions of the police , but a ‘ criminal act_-0.417 ’ or a ‘ cry_0.118 for loot_0.562 ’ ."
"as6-fragment02","430","This was an argument put_-0.171 most succinctly by Geoffrey Dear , Chief Constable of the West Midlands ( Dear , 1985 ) and by Douglas Hurd , the Home Secretary , in relation to Handsworth ."
"as6-fragment02","431","But it recurred as a theme in official and press responses_-0.091 to the other riots ."
"as6-fragment02","432","The specific form_-0.343 was built_-0.118 upon the notion that the outbreak of violence in Handsworth and Brixton , in particular , was brought about by ‘ drug barons ’ who saw_-0.636 the police attempting to curb their activities and control ‘ their territory ’ ."
"as6-fragment02","433","Numerous examples of this line_0.091 of argument can be found_-0.242 in Dear 's report on Handsworth , and in press coverage during the riots ."
"as6-fragment02","434","Taking_-0.486 the specific argument about the role_-0.029 of drugs and ‘ drug barons ’ in stimulating the riots , this seems to have served_-0.029 two purposes ."
"as6-fragment02","435","First , it distanced_0.188 the riots from the social , economic , political , and other grievances_0.188 which had been linked_0.294 to them by locating_0.206 the cause outside the ‘ social problems ’ of inner-city dwellers and in the ‘ simple greed ’ of the drug barons_0.364 to accumulate ‘ loot_0.156 ’ ."
"as6-fragment02","436","Second , just as Dear 's image_-0.156 of a few hundred ‘ young black criminals ’ was used to explain what happened in Handsworth , the problem of drugs was used to explain what happened at a national level_-0.29 ."
"as6-fragment02","437","The issue of drugs provided an everyday image_0.057 , already a national issue through saturation_0.382 media coverage and public debate , around which the police , the Home Office , and other institutions could depoliticize_0.371 the riots ."
"as6-fragment02","438","Responding to the Handsworth events Douglas Hurd was moved_-0.294 to argue forcibly_0.559 that such events were senseless_0.088 and reflected_-0.03 more on those who participated in them than on the society in which they took_-0.206 place_-0.171 : ‘ The sound which law abiding people in Handsworth heard on Monday night , the echoes_0.545 of which I picked_-0.147 up on Tuesday , was not a cry_-0.059 for help but a cry_0.375 for loot_0.531 ’ ( Financial Times , 13 September 1985 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","439","The Chief Constable for the West Midlands , Geoffrey Dear , took_-0.182 this argument further_0.065 by pointing_-0.152 out that the day before the riots a successful carnival had taken_-0.118 place_-0.441 , with the support_-0.303 of local community leaders ."
"as6-fragment02","440","He drew_0.065 the conclusion from this that the riot ‘ came_-0.242 like a bolt_0.382 out of the blue_0.147 ’ ( Guardian , 21 November 1985 ) ."
"as6-fragment02","441","Such language focused_-0.258 attention on the individuals or groups who were ‘ breaking_0.152 the law ’ , ‘ committing_0.088 criminal acts ’ , and threatening_0.188 the interests of the law-abiding ‘ majority ’ ."
"b17-fragment02","170","PART 2 Sociology and crime"
"b17-fragment02","171","Explaining crime : theories of criminality"
"b17-fragment02","172","Most people have their own notions or theories as to what causes criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","173","For example , lack of discipline in the home , genetic defects , poverty , mixing_-0.235 with the ‘ wrong sort ’ have all been proposed as causes of criminality ."
"b17-fragment02","174","While such notions may all contains_0.062 some elements_0.25 of truth , they are by no means complete explanations of criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","175","This chapter will examine_0.286 a range_-0.226 of theories which attempt_0 to explain such behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","176","Although the major theoretical explanations are covered_0.118 in the numerous introductions_0.091 to the sociology of crime and deviance and to sociology generally , some review of these theories is necessary before embarking_0.226 upon an examination of specific , substantive examples of criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","177","As this is not a book on criminological theories , what follows_-0.212 will be a brief_-0.121 overview of a wide_-0.088 range_0.118 of theories and explanations ."
"b17-fragment02","178","First , a word of warning might be in order_-0.294 ."
"b17-fragment02","179","It would be naive to expect to uncover_-0.125 any ultimate explanation or basic cause for criminal behaviour , given the extensive_0.182 and diverse behaviour that is encompassed_0.323 by the term crime ."
"b17-fragment02","180","Suppose , for example , that it could be proved that one cause of delinquency was lack of parental supervision ."
"b17-fragment02","181","It might still be necessary to ask why delinquency occurred with one son or daughter but not another ."
"b17-fragment02","182","Also , there would be the further question of why the parents had not provided adequate supervision ."
"b17-fragment02","183","Perhaps this was because of their poor_0.167 living conditions which would raise_-0.156 the question of why they were in poor_-0.353 housing ."
"b17-fragment02","184","Was this because of governmental housing policy or a poor_-0.147 employment record on the part of the bread-winner of the family ?"
"b17-fragment02","185","Clearly_0.031 , we are getting_-0.182 further_0.029 and further_-0.062 away from the causes of delinquent behaviour , and it is perhaps wisest to think in terms of causal processes when looking_-0.324 at criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","186","Biological and psychological theories"
"b17-fragment02","187","Before examining the major sociological on crime , it is useful to refer to theories from outside of sociology , from other academic disciplines ."
"b17-fragment02","188","Thus , we will look_-0.441 initially at biological and psychological theories ."
"b17-fragment02","189","Biological theories"
"b17-fragment02","190","Biological ( or physiological ) explanations are based_-0.059 on the notion that some individuals are predisposed to criminal behaviour because of their genetic make-up_0.212 ."
"b17-fragment02","191","The individual criminal is born so ; and this is usually put_0.029 down to ‘ faulty chromosome patterns_-0.032 ’ , or , more vaguely , to ‘ hereditary_0.382 traits ’ ."
"b17-fragment02","192","The most famous exponent of this approach_0 was the nineteenth-century Italian physician , Cesare Lombroso ."
"b17-fragment02","193","In his book L'Uomo Delinquente , Lombroso developed a complex description of what he called_-0.257 the ‘ born criminal ’ , who could be recognised by a variety of physical characteristics , in particular facial characteristics — for example large jaws and ears , and high cheek bones ."
"b17-fragment02","194","In the medical faculty at the University of Rome there is a gallery of portraits of splendidly ugly delinquents who were used to illustrate_0.438 Lombroso 's theory ."
"b17-fragment02","195","To use his own language :"
"b17-fragment02","196","Thus were explained anatomically the enormous jaws , high cheek bones , prominent superciliary arches_-0.03 , solitary_0.219 lines on the palms , extreme size of the orbits_0.424 , handle-shaped_-0.015 or sessile_0.571 ears found_-0.303 in criminals , savages_0.531 and apes , insensibility of pain , extremely acute_0.062 sight , tattooing , excessive idleness , love of orgies and the craving for evil for its own sake …"
"b17-fragment02","197","These explanations see_-0.485 the delinquent individual as inherently more prone_0.188 to criminal behaviour than the non-delinquent ."
"b17-fragment02","198","They have been widely criticised and rejected by sociologists ."
"b17-fragment02","199","Lombroso 's work , for example , was based_-0.303 on his examination of people in prison in Italy ."
"b17-fragment02","200","This would , necessarily , ignore_-0.029 the fact that many criminals do not go to prison , and that , perhaps , people in prison are not always criminal ."
"b17-fragment02","201","Most advocates_0.182 of biological theories do not express_0 themselves in the same bizarre language and style as Lombroso , and such theories of crime are not merely historical relics_0.273 that died_0.303 with Lombroso ."
"b17-fragment02","202","In a major study of institutionalised delinquents ( delinquents in some form_-0.206 of custody ) in the USA in the 1950s , Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck found_-0.171 that delinquent boys were twice as likely to have a mesomorphic build , a chunky , muscular , compared with non-delinquent boys ."
"b17-fragment02","203","However , the fact that the study was restricted_0.152 to institutionalised delinquents limits the validity of the association_0.242 between body build and crime and delinquency ."
"b17-fragment02","204","It may be that tougher-looking_0.212 delinquents are more liable to be put_-0.441 away_0.029 than fragile_0.212 looking ones ."
"b17-fragment02","205","Furthermore , it has been found_-0.294 that the association_0.118 between delinquency on the one hand_0.059 and height , weight and physique on the other_0.061 is greatly reduced_0.176 once social , background_0.324 factors are taken_0 into account_-0.125 ."
"b17-fragment02","206","For example , lower_-0.188 working-class people are more likely to be mesomorphic as a result of their diet and continual manual labour , and this class grouping is more likely to be found_-0.242 represented in the criminal statistics ."
"b17-fragment02","207","With regard to the links_-0.314 between criminal behaviour and inherited_0.091 characteristics , there have been a number of theoretical explanations suggesting_-0.229 an association_0 between criminality and particular personality characteristics ."
"b17-fragment02","208","An example of this more sophisticated_0.364 biological approach_-0.031 is the work of Hans Eysenck , who has argued in a series of studies , that there is a link_0.062 between genetically based personality characteristics and criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","209","He maintains_0.156 that there is a link_-0.097 between characteristics such as extroversion and criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","210","An individual 's degree_-0.161 of extroversion or introversion is inherited_0.121 , determined_0.182 by his or her genetic make-up_0.441 ."
"b17-fragment02","211","The link_0.061 with crime found_-0.303 by Eysenck was that when prisoners were tested for extroversion , more extroverts were found_-0.206 than in the general population ."
"b17-fragment02","212","Eysenck then argues that extroversion is the inherited_0.242 basis of criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","213","Extroverts take_-0.323 longer to learn the rules_-0.194 of society , they are more likely to break_0.125 them , and thus more likely become convicted criminals ."
"b17-fragment02","214","As with Lombroso 's work and the Gluecks ' study discussed above_-0.281 , by starting with institutionalised criminals , it is assumed_0.143 that all prisoners are criminals and that most criminals do , in fact , go to prison ."
"b17-fragment02","215","The people who get caught and imprisoned may not be a representative picture_0.273 of all criminals ."
"b17-fragment02","216","The major problem faced_-0.032 by theories suggesting_-0.1 a link_-0.207 between genetic make-up_0.176 and criminal behaviour is the difficulty of distinguishing between genetic and environmental effects ."
"b17-fragment02","217","While some genetic influence can not be ruled out , just what is inherited_0.333 remains very unclear ."
"b17-fragment02","218","Psychological theories"
"b17-fragment02","219","These theories share_-0.088 certain similarities with biological explanations ."
"b17-fragment02","220","They stress_0.156 the link_-0.091 between criminal behaviour and specific personality traits or characteristics ."
"b17-fragment02","221","Psychological theories , however , see_-0.212 these characteristics as a result of unusual or abnormal experiences , rather than as inherited_0.226 ."
"b17-fragment02","222","Thus , as with biological theories , crime is seen_-0.515 as pathological ( a disease ) , as something to be looked_-0.147 at from the medical point_-0.029 of view_-0.152 ."
"b17-fragment02","223","However , psychological causes are seen as treatable , whereas biological causes mark_-0.242 the individual for life ."
"b17-fragment02","224","In those cases there is no possible treatment , one is born a criminal ."
"b17-fragment02","225","Many psychological theories refer_-0.029 to faulty parent-child relationships , such as abnormal experiences in early childhood having a lasting effect and influence on personality ."
"b17-fragment02","226","Studies in this area_-0.219 have indicated_-0.057 that too strict_0.062 or too lax_0.258 parental attitudes_0.114 increase the risk of delinquency ( the work of John Bowlby , for example ) ; they have found_-0.344 that if a young child is deprived of close_-0.088 personal relationships with parents or parent figures then ‘ problem behaviour ’ is more common ."
"b17-fragment02","227","It is well established that in the delinquent-prone , home discipline is more liable to be too lax_0.2 , strict or erratic ."
"b17-fragment02","228","However , it is patently obvious that parents can be a good or bad influence and example for their children , and this fact can hardly be used to explain_-0.121 present patterns_0.265 of crime ."
"b17-fragment02","229","The majority of offenders do not come from disturbed_0.412 or broken_0.067 homes , and many broken_0.057 homes do not produce_0 delinquents ."
"b17-fragment02","230","Of course , this last point_-0.25 does not show_0 that there is no link_-0.059 between parent-child relations and crime and delinquency ."
"b17-fragment02","231","The problem with assessing_0.448 the influence of parental and family dimensions_0.118 , such as weak_-0.265 supervision or parental criminality , is the fact that they are closely_0 linked_-0.091 to various aspects_0.147 of social and economic disadvantage , such as poverty , overcrowding and poor_0 housing ."
"b17-fragment02","232","And it may be that these disadvantages help to cause parental difficulties , and hamper_0.118 good parenting ."
"b17-fragment02","233","We can hardly do justice to the wide_-0.324 scope of psychological theories here_-0.364 , but there are some basic ideas and assumptions which underlie such theorizing ."
"b17-fragment02","234","These stress_0.088 the importance of family relationships and upbringing during the early years , and conclude_0 that anti-social , and by implication criminal , behaviour results from faulty personality development ."
"b17-fragment02","235","To summarise , these biological and psychological theories hold_-0.057 that the criminal is a particular type of person , apart from the rest_-0.273 of society and with a special predisposition toward criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","236","They are based_-0.457 on the idea that criminal behaviour is either inherited_0.324 or a consequence of unique , individual experiences ."
"b17-fragment02","237","Before we look_-0.387 at sociological explanations it might be useful to ask yourself , or to discuss with colleagues , whether you feel_-0.406 that criminals are different ‘ types ’ of person ."
"b17-fragment02","238","While there are , no doubt , predispositions toward criminal behaviour , and clearly certain characteristics are inherited_0.258 , most sociologists would reject these ‘ individual pathology ’ sort of theories ."
"b17-fragment02","239","They lack convincing supporting_-0.161 evidence ."
"b17-fragment02","240","While some offenders suffer from mental disorders the vast_0.324 majority do not ."
"b17-fragment02","241","Furthermore , if criminals are abnormal then it follows_0.312 that a large_-0.235 proportion of the population must also be abnormal ."
"b17-fragment02","242","For numerous studies have shown_-0.343 that a high_-0.273 percentage of the population have committed criminal offences , in particular high_-0.265 proportions of juveniles , and it is difficult to believe that they are all different or abnormal ."
"b17-fragment02","243","Sociological theories"
"b17-fragment02","244","We said above_-0.061 that sociologists would reject non-sociological explanations of crime ."
"b17-fragment02","245","This is not because such explanations are ‘ wrong ’ , but because they are incomplete_0 or inadequate ."
"b17-fragment02","246","In Chapter One , it was stressed_0.219 that crime can not be considered_-0.091 aside from its social context_0.353 , that it is dependent on society defining certain actions as criminal , and on the reaction_0.121 of others to such actions ."

"b1g-fragment02","740","Ian Masser"
"b1g-fragment02","741","Given the extent_0.182 to which geographic information management is applications_0.194 driven , it is important to consider_-0.212 in some depth_0.03 the characteristics of some potential application_0.061 fields_0.371 ."
"b1g-fragment02","742","In the process it will be necessary to examine_-0.206 not only the extent_0.194 to which geographic issues feature on the policy issues agenda in these fields_-0.031 but also the institutional context_0.303 which governs_0.094 decision-making and the extent_0.029 to which data are available for research and policy analysis purposes ."
"b1g-fragment02","743","Questions_-0.323 on data availability are likely to be particularly important where users are heavily_0.364 dependent on secondary sources_-0.182 ."
"b1g-fragment02","744","In situations_0.265 of this kind provisions_0.176 governing_0.455 access_0.121 and format_0.176 may exert_0 powerful_-0.062 constraints on the use that can be made_-0.424 of these data ."
"b1g-fragment02","745","The first four chapters in this part_-0.294 examine_0 issues relating to geographic information handling_0.406 in terms of four potential applications_0.125 fields_0.176 ."
"b1g-fragment02","746","The authors were asked to review the current state_0.029 of the art_0.312 in their fields_0.219 with particular reference to the likely requirements of the future policy issues agenda in terms of the demands that they make_-0.273 on geographic information management ."
"b1g-fragment02","747","Authors were also asked to evaluate critically the state_-0.25 of geographic information provision in terms of the needs of users and to consider_-0.152 the impact_-0.121 of user requirements on the development of geographic information handling_0.086 methodology ."
"b1g-fragment02","748","In this way_-0.176 the chapters in this part_-0.375 present_-0.147 a number of perspectives_0.548 which essentially complement and amplify_0.206 the discussion_0.121 in the previous part_-0.424 ."
"b1g-fragment02","749","In this case , however , methodological issues are tackled_0.2 from a largely user standpoint , whereas in the previous part_-0.212 they were viewed_-0.344 as substantive problems in their own right ."
"b1g-fragment02","750","In effect the product_0.147 of the discussion_0.065 in both parts_-0.312 is a matrix_0.257 where the methodological issues are listed_-0.088 along one axis_0.371 and particular applications_0.333 fields_0.061 on the other_-0.438 ."
"b1g-fragment02","751","Figure 8.1 summarizes_0.086 the main features_-0.182 of this matrix ."
"b1g-fragment02","752","There are important differences between the chapters in this part_-0.235 both in the nature_0.088 of the demands that they make_-0.229 on geographic information and also in the relative importance that is attached_0.182 to geographic criteria as against other issues by planners and decision-makers in these fields_-0.121 ."
"b1g-fragment02","753","The first three chapters dealing_-0.281 with environmental monitoring , natural and technological hazards and settlements and infrastructure applications_0.294 make_-0.312 use of a very wide_0.059 range_-0.281 of geographic information ."
"b1g-fragment02","754","A major feature_-0.171 of these applications_0.182 is the extent_0.088 to which they involve overlays_0.257 of a variety of information drawn_0 from different sources_-0.286 on a topographic map base_-0.167 ."
"b1g-fragment02","755","for this reason they make_-0.323 particularly heavy_-0.303 demands on current GIS technology both because of the size_-0.188 of the data sets and the diversity of the data structures_0.03 that are involved ."
"b1g-fragment02","756","Brown 's chapter on geodemographics discusses_0.182 an application_0.412 field_-0.265 where primary data collected_0.152 for operational purposes are typically evaluated in relation to secondary data derived_0.206 from sources_-0.147 such as the Census of Population ."
"b1g-fragment02","757","The range_0.091 of data sets involved and the demands that are made_-0.088 on GIS technology in applications_0.088 of this kind are often more limited than those of previous applications_0.312 fields_0.029 ."
"b1g-fragment02","758","However , this is offset by the demands that are made_-0.636 on spatial analysis and modelling_-0.194 methodology ."

"b1g-fragment02","762","One of the examples of work in progress_-0.111 discusses_-0.323 research that has been carried out for the European Commission as part_-0.429 of the CORINE Project ."
"b1g-fragment02","763","This highlights_0.188 the challenges_0.118 for research in a field_-0.143 categorized by a lack of data for some countries , varying definitions and standards_0.176 in use , and unreasonably high_-0.389 user expectations ."
"b1g-fragment02","764","The chapter as a whole draws_-0.25 attention to a number of key methodological issues that are involved in environmental monitoring and prediction ."
"b1g-fragment02","765","These include_-0.588 the highly specialized nature_0.129 of much of the technical analysis , the limited capacity_0.125 for checking the accuracy of many of the findings of this kind of research and the consequent need for the development of knowledge-based_0.152 inference machines for extracting_0.031 useful information from secondary and often proxy data ."
"b1g-fragment02","766","In Chapter 10 Gatrell and Vincent consider a wide range of natural and technological hazards including industrial hazards , risk assessment , hazardous waste disposal , emergency planning , natural hazards and environmental epidemiology ."

"b1g-fragment02","768","To model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas generated by a chemical explosion and its impact on the surrounding area , for example , an understanding of atmospheric dispersion models , epidemiology and population distribution would be required ."
"b1g-fragment02","769","In applications of this kind the authors argue that geographic information management in general and GIS in particular have an important role to play and they give a number of examples from research in progress to illustrate the current state of the art in this field ."
"b1g-fragment02","770","The discussion of operational problems and prospects further amplifies many of the issues raised in preceding chapters , particularly with respect to the problems caused by the dependency on secondary data sources and the need for much more detailed geographic information to overcome some of the problems associated with linking data sets ."
"b1g-fragment02","771","Like most of the other contributors to this section , Gatrell and Vincent see decision support systems as a major area for future development in the geographic information management field ."
"b1g-fragment02","772","Given that ‘ most GIS are rather dumb systems , requiring intelligent , very computer literate users ’ , managing natural and technological hazards means that this knowledge base must be built into the system so that it can be utilized quickly by untrained users after a disaster has taken place or in an emergency ."
"b1g-fragment02","773","The settlement and infrastructure field is also characterized by a wide range of users with a great diversity of interests ."
"b1g-fragment02","774","These include not only central and local government but also major utility companies and transport suppliers ."

"b1g-fragment02","776","In addition to these data requirements , such users are also interested in developing their capabilities for modelling the changing relationships between the supply and demand for infrastructure in the context of both public and private sector decision-making ."
"b1g-fragment02","777","Shepherd , more than any other contributor to this section , draws attention to the extent to which current efforts in the geographic information management field are constrained by the highly fragmented nature of both data suppliers and users both in sectoral and spatial terms , the great diversity of data sets in varying formats and the difficulties presented by institutional factors such as copyright provision , data ownership and the control of access to data ."
"b1g-fragment02","778","Digital data occupy a central position in this applications field and a number of examples are given to illustrate the extent to which their development has been hampered or facilitated in various countries by the policies of the organizations with responsibility for digital data provision ."
"b1g-fragment02","779","In Chapter 12 Brown reviews the development of geodemographics from its origins in the computer-based social area analysis of US census tract data from 1950 onwards ."
"b1g-fragment02","780","He describes the features of the four main systems that are currently in use in the UK and illustrates their application with reference to examples drawn from retail analysis and store location , market research , credit rating and target marketing ."
"b1g-fragment02","781","Brown demonstrates the extent to which the growth of research activities in this field has led to the emergence of improved cluster analytic methods for the multidimensional classification of people according to the type of area in which they live ."
"b1g-fragment02","782","In the last part of this contribution , Brown identifies a number of priorities for future research ."
"b1g-fragment02","783","Like Gatrell and Vincent and Shepherd before him , he is concerned with the lack of detailed geographical information particularly in this case with reference to the years between censuses ."
"b1g-fragment02","784","Spatial linkages also feature prominently in Brown 's discussion which amplifies many of the points made in the earlier contribution from Openshaw in Chapter 3 ."
"b1g-fragment02","785","The analysis points to the need for the development of a fuzzy geodemographics methodology which takes account of the effects of different types of spatial errors ."
"b1g-fragment02","786","Other major research priorities for the future in this applications field are the development of response-modelling techniques to explore the factors affecting consumer choice ."
"b1g-fragment02","787","This is particularly important in a field where many of the demands made by users are highly specialized in nature ."
"b1g-fragment02","788","In summary , then , as fig. 8.1 shows , many of the issues raised by this review of geographic information handling in the four potential application fields are essentially complementary to those discussed in the part on methodological developments ."
"b1g-fragment02","789","Spatial analysis features particularly prominent on the research agenda relating to natural and technological hazards and geodemographics ."
"b1g-fragment02","790","Questions relating to data integration emerge as being particularly critical in terms of environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure applications ."
"b1g-fragment02","791","Spatial linkages and questions relating to spatial representation feature prominently in the settlements and infrastructure and geodemographics fields ."
"b1g-fragment02","792","The evaluation of error propagation is a matter of considerable significance in the environmental monitoring and settlements and infrastructure fields ."
"b1g-fragment02","793","Finally , in all applications fields , the findings of the reviews above suggest that there is a need for improvements in user interfaces of all kinds ."
"b1g-fragment02","794","This is particularly evident in the demand for the development of knowledge-based decision support systems and modelling capabilities ."
"b1g-fragment02","795","Such demands highlight the extent to which geographic information management must be regarded as a means to an end rather than an end in itself when viewed from the standpoints of the needs of planners and decision-makers ."
"b1g-fragment02","796","The final chapter in this section rounds off the discussion of applications-related research with an examination of organizational issues that need to be taken account of in handling geographic information ."
"b1g-fragment02","797","Campbell presents a conceptual framework for the analysis of the organizational issues involved in the development and implementation of GIS ."
"b1g-fragment02","798","This contribution cuts across many of the questions relating to particular applications that were raised in preceding chapters and draws attention to the dangers of neglecting institutional and personal considerations in practice ."
"b1g-fragment02","799","All too often , as the experience of many mature applications indicates , technical and data-related matters dominate the system development phase and technically elegant solutions are devised which fail to take enough account of user needs and capabilities ."
"b1g-fragment02","800","Campbell discusses the role of geographic information in organizations and the process of GIS diffusion drawing upon research from a variety of social science disciplines ."
"b1g-fragment02","801","The findings of the analysis are summarized in two sets of research questions for all applications fields ."
"b1g-fragment02","802","In this way she sets out a research agenda for applications-related research which serves a similar function to the spatial analysis research agenda set out by Openshaw at the beginning of Part Two ."

"b1g-fragment02","805","Introduction"
"b1g-fragment02","806","Monitoring of the state of and the changes in the environment is now universally recognized as being of profound importance to mankind ( Tickell 1986 , 1989 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","807","This awareness is most obviously manifested by the frequent appearance of press reports on ozone depletion , on the greenhouse effect and possible global warming , on nitrate pollution , on deforestation in the Tropics , on decreasing biological diversity and on many other environmentally related topics ."
"b1g-fragment02","808","Usually these reports concentrate on prophecies of a forthcoming Armageddon but many also describe a dire contemporary situation ."
"b1g-fragment02","809","Thus the algal bloom off the Italian Adriatic shore in 1989 is reckoned to have caused the holiday trade and local fisherman losses running into tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds ."
"b1g-fragment02","810","More globally , the Brundtland Report ( WCED 1987 ) noted that , in the 900 days during which the World Commission was at work ,"
"b1g-fragment02","811","1 ."
"b1g-fragment02","812","The African drought put the lives of 35 million people at risk and may have killed 1 million of them ;"
"b1g-fragment02","813","2 ."
"b1g-fragment02","814","The Bhopal accident killed 2000 and injured 200 000 more ;"
"b1g-fragment02","815","3 ."
"b1g-fragment02","816","The Chernobyl disaster caused environmental damage across Europe ;"
"b1g-fragment02","817","4 ."
"b1g-fragment02","818","A chemical fire in Switzerland caused toxic materials to be transported by the Rhine at least as far as the Netherlands ;"
"b1g-fragment02","819","5 ."
"b1g-fragment02","820","At least 60 million people died of diarrhoeal diseases caused by malnutrition and dirty water ."
"b1g-fragment02","821","As a consequence of these and other disasters , of rapid and world-wide broadcasting of them and of the concerned action of many individuals , the environment is now ‘ moving fast up the political agenda ’ ( Patten 1989 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","822","The then Prime Minister also emphasized the political awakening to the environment in statements such as : ‘ it is possible that with all these enormous changes ( population , agricultural , use of fossil fuels ) concentrated into such a short period of time , we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself ’ ( Thatcher 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","823","The political concern is not altruistic ."
"b1g-fragment02","824","Mrs Thatcher , a recent convert to environmental conservation , clearly held the opinion that environmental problems are not only soluble but that solving them can be shown to be cost-effective :"
"b1g-fragment02","825","In the past when we identified forms of pollution , we have shown our capacity to act effectively ."
"b1g-fragment02","826","The great London smogs are now only a nightmare of the past ."
"b1g-fragment02","827","We have cut airborne lead by 50 per cent ."
"b1g-fragment02","828","We are spending £4 billion on cleansing the Mersey Basin alone , and the Thames now has the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world ."
"b1g-fragment02","829","Even though this kind of action may cost a lot , I believe it to be money well and necessarily spent because the health of our economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other … ."
"b1g-fragment02","830","The Government espouses the concept of sustainable economic development ."
"b1g-fragment02","831","Stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded ( Thatcher 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","832","The primary official manifestation of this UK commitment to the environment has been the government 's White Paper ( HMSO 1990 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","833","While criticized by many on the grounds that it had few ‘ teeth ’ and represented a compromise between the DoE and all other departments ( notably those of Agriculture and of Transport ) , it was none the less a major achievement ."
"b1g-fragment02","834","Its main sections dealt with the government 's approach to the environment ( nationally , at the European level and globally ) , the nature and effects of the greenhouse effect , environmental problems in both rural and urban areas ( especially in relation to land-use matters ) , pollution control and enhancing awareness of environmental matters ."
"b1g-fragment02","835","Central to this approach is said to be an emphasis upon guidance from the best available scientific evidence ."
"b1g-fragment02","836","There is also a clear recognition of the need for monitoring and modelling of the state of the natural and man-influenced environment ."
"b1g-fragment02","837","Though there has been a change of Prime Minister and of the Secretary of State for the Environment since the publication of the White Paper , the environmental cause seems as strong as ever ."
"b1g-fragment02","838","Thus , The Times of 17 December 1990 reported that a group of 40 of the most senior Civil Servants had met the previous weekend to discuss ‘ ways in which the government machine could respond better to national and international problems such as the threat of global climate change ’ ."
"b1g-fragment02","839","Pearce et al. ( 1989 ) have argued that the effects of government , commercial and other actions on the environment can and should be assessed on a cost/benefit basis and this seems likely to be the basis on which at least the UK government will proceed ."
"b1g-fragment02","840","Given such a lead , it is scarcely surprising that British scientists have sought to demonstrate the practical and financial consequences of environmental events and processes ; Table 9.1 , for example illustrates their perception of the importance of global environmental research to the UK domestic economy ."
"b1g-fragment02","841","If it now seems self-evident that monitoring of the global environment is necessary , indeed is even vital , the prediction of what is likely to happen is almost as important : the 170 000 people in the Maldives are understandably worried about the prospect of global sea-level change since no part of the islands is more than 2 m above present sea-level !"
"b1g-fragment02","842","Yet , as we shall see below , the prediction of the activities of natural and man-influenced environmental systems requires an understanding of the interaction of processes that , in many cases , we simply do not yet have ."
"b1g-fragment02","843","Even monitoring of the present is very imperfect , as witness the order of magnitude variations in estimates now current for deforestation rates ."
"b1g-fragment02","844","This chapter , then , attempts to review some of the problems in environmental monitoring and prediction , describes some of the relevant scientific and organizational activities and looks ahead to what is likely to happen next ."
"b1g-fragment02","845","The nature of environmental processes"
"b1g-fragment02","846","Notwithstanding Mrs Thatcher 's confidence that we can ‘ fix ’ environmental problems , the difficulties associated with a task even as apparently simple as monitoring a state variable are considerable ."
"b1g-fragment02","847","Some of the reasons for this — the difficulty of deciding on appropriate proxy variables and on economical yet non-biasing temporal and spatial sampling frameworks , taking account of the relative importance of aperiodic and rare events as compared to near-continuous processes , processing the vast volumes of data usually involved and organizing the multidisciplinary and ( often ) multinational researchers involved — are discussed briefly later ."
"b1g-fragment02","848","Even at this stage , however , it is important to stress that we have a very incomplete understanding of many processes in the natural environment ."
"b1g-fragment02","849","The next section therefore attempts to summarize what we do know ; it is derived chiefly from the Earth System Sciences Committee ( ESSC ) ( 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","850","Temporal and spatial scales of operation"
"b1g-fragment02","851","Even ignoring the effects of man , earth system processes operate at a variety of spatial and temporal scales ( see Fig. 9.1 ; see also Rosswall et al. 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","852","Thus microclimate effects can have major short-term implications for local populations ( such as those brought about by the photochemical smogs of Los Angeles ) , are often applicable only over areas of a few hectares or less and may operate on a diurnal cycle ."
"b1g-fragment02","853","In contrast , soil creation ( cf. soil degradation ) may require hundreds or thousands of years ."
"b1g-fragment02","854","In between are variations in phenomena such as El Nino ."
"b1g-fragment02","855","The sampling theorem indicates that we must sample these phenomena at a frequency of no less than half their wavelength if we are to avoid bias in measurement ."
"b1g-fragment02","856","In this chapter , the primary concern is with changes occurring over time spans from minutes to centuries and from spatial wavelengths from about 1 m to about 100 km ."
"b1g-fragment02","857","It is , however , impossible to separate out processes acting at different scales and over different periods : a single volcanic eruption lasting hours or days sometimes leads to dust and gas being ejected into the atmosphere over a period of months and this in turn may lead to global climatic fluctuations over years or decades ."
"b1g-fragment02","858","Conversely , a large-scale and long-period phenomenon such as the movement of tectonic plates can lead to local stress accumulation and to its release by an earthquake in a few seconds and with highly local effects ."
"b1g-fragment02","859","This therefore has the following consequences :"
"b1g-fragment02","860","1 ."
"b1g-fragment02","861","We should know something about the periodicity of the variables we are monitoring if we are not to risk either unnecessarily detailed data collection or aliasing of trends ;"
"b1g-fragment02","862","2 ."
"b1g-fragment02","863","Since we know that the periodicity of some variables is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human beings , we must make use of surrogate or proxy variables to extend our range of knowledge ( such as via tree rings , palynology , oxygen isotope ratios from ice cores and geomorphological evidence of environmental change ) ;"
"b1g-fragment02","864","3 ."
"b1g-fragment02","865","Since we are not yet able to predict all the interactions which may be important in a study of environmental problems , collecting potentially useful data as well as those believed central to the problem under study is often wise ;"
"b1g-fragment02","866","4 ."
"b1g-fragment02","867","We must accept that most data collection exercises will inevitably be a compromise on the grounds of cost and hence less than perfect data sets will be produced ;"
"b1g-fragment02","868","5 ."
"b1g-fragment02","869","Irrespective of the use of surrogates , monitoring environmental processes only makes sense over time-scales which are extended by human standards ( hence the IGBP ( see below ) is designed to run for two or three decades ) ;"
"b1g-fragment02","870","6 ."
"b1g-fragment02","871","Changes in political priorities may simply result in the need for informed guesswork if suitable data are not available ."
"b1g-fragment02","872","Much attention will be given throughout this chapter to monitoring the environment on a global basis ."
"b1g-fragment02","873","This is not merely because of its topical nature ."
"b1g-fragment02","874","The main reason is that — though some problems are local and are best studied that way — many others ( even involving a limited geographical extent ) are best understood within a global framework ."
"b1g-fragment02","875","Thus no meteorologist would attempt to forecast the weather 2 or 3 days ahead without using a mathematical model based on observations from all around the world ."
"b1g-fragment02","876","Moreover , recent work has shown that much of the heat energy in the seas of the North Atlantic ( every square kilometre of which gives off as much energy as a nuclear power station and hence influences our weather ) is absorbed from sunlight in the tropical Pacific and is carried by ocean currents through the Drake Passage and up into the Atlantic ."
"b1g-fragment02","877","Thus , to understand some local and many regional , national and continental and all global environmental events , we need to have a global perspective and hold global databases ( Rhind and Mounsey 1989 ; Mounsey and Tomlinson 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","878","In no way , however , does this invalidate the need for microscale studies — for instance , while global data sets may indicate the extent of algal blooms and may suggest causes of them , only detailed study of the algae themselves can provide understanding of why the bloom is occurring ."
"b1g-fragment02","879","The processes themselves"
"b1g-fragment02","880","A major complication , however , is that the environment can rarely be treated as in a laboratory experiment ."
"b1g-fragment02","881","Given this , determining the nature of the interactions between the variables becomes a matter of major difficulty ."
"b1g-fragment02","882","Figure 9.2 is taken from ESSC ( 1988 ) and is an attempt to show the interactions between environmental processes , as well as the indicators and implications of change in the state of the environment ."
"b1g-fragment02","883","In essence , the figure can be summarized as showing processes within the physical climate system and within the biogeochemical one , these systems being interwoven by the global role of water and increasingly affected by human activities ."
"b1g-fragment02","884","The main components of the first system are well known : the atmosphere is its engine and atmospheric circulation is driven by differences in solar heating between the equatorial and polar regions ."
"b1g-fragment02","885","We are , however , becoming ever more aware of the massive influence of oceans on our climate ; research into ocean/atmosphere interactions is now a priority ."
"b1g-fragment02","886","In ocean dynamics studies , important topics are heat storage , circulation and the role of sea ice ."
"b1g-fragment02","887","Atmospheric circulation ( and , in turn , precipitation and temperature ) is also greatly affected by the balance of thermal energy at the land surface , itself affected by the vegetation and terrain characteristics ."
"b1g-fragment02","888","The biogeochemical system embraces the totality of the movements of the key elements essential to life — carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and others — through what has been described as the total earth system ."
"b1g-fragment02","889","The oceans and their biota play a central role in the carbon and nutrient cycles ; global ocean circulation is also critical to the global carbon budget ."
"b1g-fragment02","890","Trace gases in the atmosphere are key components of the cycles of such elements as carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , sulphur and the halogens ; as is now well known , their concentrations are much influenced by biogenic and anthropogenic activities and the concentrations of such gases as carbon dioxide , ozone , methane , nitrous oxide and the chlorofluoromethanes ( CFMs ) strongly affect radiative transfer and provide a link with the physical climate system ."
"b1g-fragment02","891","A particular cause for concern is that the concentrations of the two main CFMs is increasing by about 5 per cent per annum while the equivalent figures for methane , nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are 1 , 0.4 and 0.3 per cent ."
"b1g-fragment02","892","Finally , the chemistry of the stratosphere is dominated by the photochemical production and catalytic destruction of ozone ."
"b1g-fragment02","893","There are several important ways in which biogeochemical processes can influence climate and hence habitability ( except where the latter is maintained at enormous cost ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","894","If , for instance , the concentrations of certain trace gases ( see above ) continue to increase , it has been predicted that the earth 's surface temperature will increase by an amount comparable to that since the last major phase of the most recent glaciation ( about 18 000 years BP ) — though there is some dispute about the magnitude of the likely change ."
"b1g-fragment02","895","The converse case — the effect of physical climate changes on biogeochemical processes — is also of obvious importance : changes in annual averages and cycles of temperature and precipitation , together with the probabilities of extreme events such as prolonged droughts or frosts , are major determinants of terrestrial ecosystem type , at least in areas largely unaffected by human activity ."
"b1g-fragment02","896","Human-induced changes to the environment have increased rapidly as a consequence of growing population numbers and of numerous developments in technology ."
"b1g-fragment02","897","fossil fuel combustion , for instance , has led to increased concentrations of sulphate in precipitation ( ’ acid rain' ) and many rivers , lakes and estuaries have been greatly affected by phosphates from agricultural , urban or industrial sources ."
"b1g-fragment02","898","It should be stressed , however , that — while the outlines of human activities are clear — there are still many uncertainties : for instance , we know that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen about 9 per cent since 1959 ."
"b1g-fragment02","899","But calculations of the total carbon released by fossil fuel combustion imply that , if all such carbon remained in the atmosphere , the concentration would have increased by twice as much ."
"b1g-fragment02","900","The absolute difference between the two figures seems to be due to two different factors : absorption by the oceans and other reductions in carbon stocks in living biota , the latter being strongly affected by human activities since the Industrial Revolution ."
"b1g-fragment02","901","Does God play dice ?"
"b1g-fragment02","902","Much environmental prediction is predicated upon a logical positivist or Newtonian deterministic basis ."
"b1g-fragment02","903","The environmental systems are effectively regarded as machines whose workings can all be discovered , described in differential equation form and whose future activities can thus be predicted in detail if their initial states are known ."
"b1g-fragment02","904","An argument by many atmospheric physicists , for example , is that shortcomings in the accuracy of weather prediction over periods of more than a few days largely results from the unsophisticated nature of existing models , the lack of suitable data and inadequate computer power ( see Fig. 9.3 , derived from Tyler 1989 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","905","In contrast , the advocates of chaos theory ( e.g. Stewart 1989 ) argue that some natural systems are so sensitive to tiny stimuli that even ‘ the faint beat of a butterfly 's wing could be the ultimate trigger for a hurricane ’ ."
"b1g-fragment02","906","In essence , they argue that tiny differences in the initial conditions of many systems can lead to widely different outcomes since the systems exhibit stochastic behaviour within a deterministic framework ."
"b1g-fragment02","907","If so , there is little chance of making accurate long-term forecasts of these systems ."
"b1g-fragment02","908","This has been recognized by , among others , ESSC ( 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","909","The authors of that report accepted that there is a theoretical limit of 2–3 weeks in explicit prediction of day-to-day fluctuations in weather because of the influence of small-scale turbulence within the large-scale dynamics ; such limits imply that medium and long-term prediction must inevitably be stochastic ."
"b1g-fragment02","910","To complicate matters still further , however , it seems at least possible that the components of the earth system may best be predicted deterministically at some spatial and temporal scales but stochastically at others and that the basis of prediction will differ for different components ."
"b1g-fragment02","911","As an example , atmospheric temperature shows marked day-to-day variability , a strong seasonal cycle with some year-to-year variations , a weak minimum variability for 10–20 year averages and then increased variation again at longer time-scales ( ESSC 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","912","It need hardly be pointed out that coping with such multiple databases on which modelling is to be carried out is not a trivial exercise ."
"b1g-fragment02","913","Finally , it is perhaps worth concluding this section by emphasizing that there is still much controversy among the scientific community about the magnitude of many of the effects being discussed ."
"b1g-fragment02","914","In general , the research work of the international groups of scientists , including those involved in the Inter-Governmental Committee and in the UK 's Inter-Agency Committee on Global Environmental Change , has progressively reduced the magnitude of the predicted effects of , for example , global warming ."
"b1g-fragment02","915","In giving the 1990 Robens Coal Science Lecture at the Royal Institution , Sir John Mason ( a former Director of the Meteorological Office ) urged caution in interpreting the results of the massive atmospheric and oceanic modelling exercises ; as the equilibrium models are refined to take account of the thermal lag in oceans , etc. , lower values of predicted changes are likely ."
"b1g-fragment02","916","Thus , while almost all scientists are — at the time of writing — convinced from the evidence that change in climate is under way and that regional effects may be much greater than the global average , the magnitude of the latter is now thought likely to be about half of what was predicted only 5 years ago ."
"b1g-fragment02","917","Who is involved and what is going on ?"
"b1g-fragment02","918","If we consider the environment in the broadest sense , much monitoring of it has been in progress for many years and by an enormous diversity of organizations in the UK ; these include the DoE , the Forestry Commission , the Nature Conservancy , the Health and Safety Executive , local authorities , the component members of the Natural Environment Research Council ( such as the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology and the British Antarctic Survey ) , individuals or research groups in academia , the CEGB , the Friends of the Earth , and UK Centre for Economic and Environmental Development ( CEED ) ( 1989 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","919","The diversity of monitoring organizations seems just as great in other countries ; numerous multinational organizations , both quasi-governmental ( e.g. the UN Environment Programme ( UNEP ) ) and non-governmental ( e.g. the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) and the International Institute for Environment and Development ( IIED ) ) are also active in the field ."
"b1g-fragment02","920","Moreover , commercial monitoring of the environment is now also routine , notably to predict crop yields in the main grain-growing areas and hence facilitate the buying of futures ."
"b1g-fragment02","921","The international scientific involvement"
"b1g-fragment02","922","Scientists have both promoted and responded to the increasing interest in the environment ."
"b1g-fragment02","923","Thus , at the global scale , the International Council of Scientific Unions ( ICSU ) has endorsed the setting up of the International Geosphere Biosphere Project ( IGBP ) to ‘ describe and understand the interactive physical , chemical and biological processes that regulate the total Earth system , the unique environment it provides for life , the changes that are occurring in that system and the manner by which these changes are influenced by human actions ’ ( Report of ad hoc Planning Group for IGBP 1986 , quoted in IGBP 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","924","Priority in the IGBP is intended to be given to those areas which deal with key interactions and significant changes on the time-scales of decades to centuries , that most affect the biosphere , that are most susceptible to human perturbations and those that will most likely lead to a practical , predictive capability for global change ."
"b1g-fragment02","925","This is to be put into operation by concentrating on four themes :"
"b1g-fragment02","926","1 ."
"b1g-fragment02","927","Documenting and predicting global change ;"
"b1g-fragment02","928","2 ."
"b1g-fragment02","929","Observing and improving our understanding of dominant forcing functions ;"
"b1g-fragment02","930","3 ."
"b1g-fragment02","931","Improving our understanding of interactive phenomena in the total Earth system ;"
"b1g-fragment02","932","4 ."
"b1g-fragment02","933","Assessing those effects of global change which will be large scale and cause major modifications to both renewable and non-renewable resources ."
"b1g-fragment02","934","By 1990 , IGBP had progressed as far as defining a set of seven core projects ( IGBP 1990 ) addressing these four themes ."
"b1g-fragment02","935","In addition , plans for regional research centres and for the data and information systems for IGBP ( known as IGBP-DIS ) had been announced ."
"b1g-fragment02","936","The latter are particularly relevant to this chapter ."
"b1g-fragment02","937","Based in Paris and working under Professor I. Rasool , it is intended to concentrate on managerial and policy aspects of the task in the first 2 years ( 1990–92 ) but then to expand considerably thereafter ."
"b1g-fragment02","938","Tasks agreed for the IGBP-DIS include making available a ‘ directory of data directories ’ modelled on NASA 's Master Directory , providing data sets for education and training and undertaking a land cover pilot study ."
"b1g-fragment02","939","Until 1990 , remarkably little interaction had taken place between the ‘ hard science ’ and the social science communities on global monitoring and prediction ."
"b1g-fragment02","940","It is noteworthy , however , that the Royal Society made a plea for just this type of multidisciplinary work in its submission on greenhouse gases to the House of Lords ' Select Committee on Science and Technology ( Royal Society 1989 : 40 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","941","Fortunately , in addition to the actions of the world ‘ hard science ’ community , a parallel effort is now being initiated by social scientists ( Fuchs 1989 ; Jacobson and Price 1990 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","942","Currently this is organized and sponsored by the International Social Science Council ( ISSC ) , the UN University and the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Studies ."
"b1g-fragment02","943","Its objectives are to :"
"b1g-fragment02","944","1 ."
"b1g-fragment02","945","Improve scientific understanding and increase awareness of the complex dynamics governing human interaction with the total Earth system ;"
"b1g-fragment02","946","2 ."
"b1g-fragment02","947","Study , explore and anticipate social change affecting the global environment ;"
"b1g-fragment02","948","3 ."
"b1g-fragment02","949","Identify broad social strategies to prevent or mitigate undesirable impacts of global change or to adapt to changes which are unavoidable ;"

"b1g-fragment02","951","Analyse policy options for dealing with global environmental change and promoting the goal of sustainable development ."
"b1g-fragment02","952","Jacobson and Price ( 1990 ) provide a useful summary of the ways in which human factors contribute to , and are affected by , likely global changes ; in particular , they stress the importance of the data-handling issues and the role of GIS in coping with some of the problems of data integration and manipulation ."
"b1g-fragment02","953","The ISSC proposed its own work programme in the Human Dimensions of Global Change in late 1990 ."
"b1g-fragment02","954","While these organizations intrinsically have a world-wide membership and are concerned with research into global environmental change , others share the same interest but from a more restricted geographical base ."
"b1g-fragment02","955","A leading example of this is the European Science Foundation which has sponsored research programmes in both the physical and social science aspects of environmental change ( ESF 1990 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","956","Governmental and political involvement"
"b1g-fragment02","957","The spread of environmental awareness is readily demonstrated : in 1972 , 26 countries had environmental and natural resource management agencies whereas , a decade later the number was 144 ( WEC 1985 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","958","In most countries , the governmental and political concern with the environment has come somewhat later than that of scientists or concerned lay people : the early development of the Green Party in the Federal Republic of Germany is something of an exception ."
"b1g-fragment02","959","Such a commitment to the environment is , none the less , both welcome and necessary if resources are to be made available to tackle existing , let alone forthcoming , environmental problems ."
"b1g-fragment02","960","The ‘ conversion ’ of the UK government has been briefly described earlier ; it is manifested in their July 1989 commitment to spend £10m. on climate change research in 1989/90 and the confident request to them from the Advisory Board for the Research Councils ( ABRC ) for an extra £11m. in 1990 and £13m. in the two succeeding years for additional environmental research ."
"b1g-fragment02","961","Perhaps the most significant development of all , however , is the increasing role of the European Commission ."
"b1g-fragment02","962","Their role in bringing environmental impact assessment ( EIA ) on to the statute book is well known , but the Commission has now made a proposal ( CEC 1989 ) for the ‘ establishment of the European Environment Agency and the European Environment Monitoring and Information Network ’ ."
"b1g-fragment02","963","The Commission argues that there is at present no monitoring of environmental quality and trends on a European scale , nor any guarantee that the results of environmental monitoring will be comparable on a Community-wide basis ( a realization brought about through the CORINE programme described later ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","964","The objectives of the new agency would be to assist the Community and the Member States to achieve the goals set out in the Treaty of Rome and in successive environmental action programmes ; it must also , however , be seen in the context of the European Council 's adoption on 2 December 1988 of the Rhodes Declaration on the Environment and the environment chapter in the Single European Act which comes into effect in 1992 ."
"b1g-fragment02","965","The detailed specific roles of ‘ the System ’ ( comprising both agency and network ) are envisaged as :"
"b1g-fragment02","966","1 ."
"b1g-fragment02","967","To provide the Community , the Member States and participating third countries with the objective ( sic ) information requested for the formulation and implementation of sound and effective environmental policies ;"
"b1g-fragment02","968","2 ."
"b1g-fragment02","969","In particular , to provide technical , scientific and economic information requested by the Commission in its tasks of identification , preparation and assessment of the implementation and results of environmental action and legislation ;"
"b1g-fragment02","970","3 ."
"b1g-fragment02","971","To stimulate the development and the application within the agency of techniques of environmental modelling and forecasting in order that adequate preventative action can be taken at the appropriate time ;"
"b1g-fragment02","972","4 ."
"b1g-fragment02","973","To help ensure the harmonization and comparability of environmental data in the Community as well as the integration of European environmental data into international environmental monitoring programmes , such as those established within the framework of the United Nations and its system of agencies ."
"b1g-fragment02","974","Considerable stress is laid by the Commission on collaboration with national data-gathering agencies and with states adjacent to the Community 's borders ."
"b1g-fragment02","975","It is envisaged that the totality of activities will extend the existing State of the European Environment report ( CEC 1988 ) through addressing the issues of the quality and sensitivity of the environment and also the pressures upon it ."
"b1g-fragment02","976","Priorities for the new agency include study of atmospheric emissions and quality , water resources and quality ( including the marine environment ) , soil erosion and pollution and important land resources , and biotopes and nature conservation ."
"b1g-fragment02","977","At the time of writing , the proposal has been approved and discussions are in progress on the location of the agency 's headquarters ."
"b1g-fragment02","978","It seems certain to have major and growing effects upon environmental monitoring and prediction in Europe and on the policies of component governments ."
"b1g-fragment02","979","Yet this is by no means the only plan which the Community has in relation to the environment : Directorate-General XII ( that for Science , Research and Development ) has published details of an extensive R&D programme ( CEC 1990a ) and the Commission as a whole ( CEC 1990b ) has made public its plans to develop regular official statistics of the environment ."
"b1g-fragment02","980","The private sector"
"b1g-fragment02","981","Certain aspects of environmental monitoring have long been carried out by the private sector , notably that of crop states on a world-wide basis ."
"b1g-fragment02","982","Derived from satellite imagery at comparatively low resolution , predicted yields for different crops in different nation states become of commercial value ."
"b1g-fragment02","983","However , significant resources are also being made available by the private sector where there is no immediate commercial gain : thus IBM UK Ltd has donated £3.5m. of computing equipment to UNEP and IBM in general is actively supporting other R&D which can be expected to facilitate ‘ sustainable development ’ : IBM Europe , for instance , has invested $16m. in its Bergen scientific centre to make it the focal point for the company 's environmental modelling and a centre for information on the environment and sustainable development ."
"b1g-fragment02","984","On a more modest basis , IBM UK have agreed to fund a pilot global population database being built in Birkbeck College to permit assessment of the impact of environmental change on the world s population ."
"b1g-fragment02","985","Many other companies , of course , are supporting environmental work but IBM seems almost to be unique in its corporate commitment to use of high technology for facilitating ‘ sustainable development ’ ."
"b1g-fragment02","986","Some examples of environmental monitoring projects"
"b1g-fragment02","987","The local scale"
"b1g-fragment02","988","At the local scale , it is usually impossible to neglect the effects of multiple processes operating ."
"b1g-fragment02","989","An example of environmental modelling and prediction where the interactions between different processes and dynamic feedback is taken into account is given by Haber and Schaller ( 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","990","Their work formed part of one UNESCO Man and Biosphere ( MAB ) project , carried out in the Berchtesgaden National Park in Bavaria ."
"b1g-fragment02","991","Following Holling ( 1978 ) and Grossman ( 1983 ) , they conceptualized the man/environment relationship at a series of hierarchical levels :"
"b1g-fragment02","992","1 ."
"b1g-fragment02","993","The lowest , or process , level , is directly and ( usually ) obviously connected to perceived reality ."
"b1g-fragment02","994","Thus processes and interrelationships are mostly obvious , simple and linear ; data are usually readily available and may be voluminous ."
"b1g-fragment02","995","This level is readily handled in commercial GIS ; ,"
"b1g-fragment02","996","2 ."
"b1g-fragment02","997","The intermediate , or dynamic , level is concerned with less frequent and often irregular events , e.g. a temporary lack of water because of fire , frost or excessive demand from an increasing populace ."
"b1g-fragment02","998","Characteristically , the data used may be more difficult to obtain and are usually more spatially aggregated ; modelling software which permits feedback loops is essential ;"
"b1g-fragment02","999","3 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1000","The top , or strategic , level is the most difficult to explore ; the external influences are often unpredictable by formal means ."
"b1g-fragment02","1001","Relevant data are therefore difficult to identify and scenario building is one of the few approaches available ."
"b1g-fragment02","1002","The Haber and Schaller approach is to ‘ soft-couple ’ these different levels and their accompanying approaches using an ecological balance model ."
"b1g-fragment02","1003","Results of running this with different scenarios include ‘ time slice ’ maps of possible outcomes and of the exchange of material and energy within the study area ."
"b1g-fragment02","1004","While ultimately qualitative , it seems to offer a method for coping with different types of process and incorporating stochastic and truly random events ."
"b1g-fragment02","1005","The national and continental scale : the CORINE project"
"b1g-fragment02","1006","The CORINE programme represents the product of much activity by the European Commission 's Directorate-General ( XI ) for the Environment ."
"b1g-fragment02","1007","It originates from an Italian request to the Council of Ministers in 1973 to identify environmentally ‘ balanced ’ and ‘ unbalanced ’ areas in the Community ; the first attempts to do this were unsuccessful and , though by 1981 it was clear that a new approach based on an environmental information system was the most promising one , funding for this was not secured until 1985 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1008","A 4-year experimental programme to ‘ collect , co-ordinate and ensure the consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resources in the European Communities ’ was set up and labelled CORINE ."
"b1g-fragment02","1009","The objectives of CORINE were to be achieved through bringing together existing data holdings in the member states , developing methods for holding , analysing and presenting the data , and encouraging the exchange of data ."
"b1g-fragment02","1010","A number of priority areas were identified , including biotopes of importance for nature conservation , acid deposition and its effects on soils and biotopes and the protection of the environment of the Mediterranean region ( Briggs and Martin 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1011","Many achievements can be claimed by the CORINE project team ."
"b1g-fragment02","1012","As a result of some 40 sub-projects involving all the Member States ( and often several groups within each one ) , databases of topography , soils , water resources and quality , biotopes , atmospheric emissions , climate , soil erosion and administrative boundaries have been built up for the whole_-0.312 Community and can be interrelated ; other data sets ( such as land cover , derived from satellite imagery ) have already been compiled for some of the Member States ."
"b1g-fragment02","1013","Various aspects of the CORINE project have been described in papers by Rhind et al. ( 1986 ) , Wiggins et al. ( 1987 ) , Briggs and Martin ( 1988 ) , Briggs and Mounsey ( 1989 ) and CEC ( 1990c ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1014","For the present purposes , however , the key findings are :"
"b1g-fragment02","1015","1 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1016","Many necessary data sets were unavailable for reasons of administrative inadequacies , confidentiality constraints , cost or non-collection in certain countries ;"
"b1g-fragment02","1017","2 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1018","The unavoidable reliance upon existing data sets led to many problems due to non-harmonization even of commonly used variables , e.g. eight different definitions of potential evapo-transpiration were in use in the Member States and ‘ maximum temperature ’ at each weather station was defined in at least four different ways ;"
"b1g-fragment02","1019","3 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1020","The compilation of a spatially coherent database from mapped information compiled by different organizations at different scales and on different topographic bases ( see Rhind and Clark 1988 ) is often difficult ;"
"b1g-fragment02","1021","4 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1022","User expectations are often unreasonably high ; use of administrative computing systems encourages bureaucrats to believe that environmental data can just as readily be analysed and used to support decisions ."
"b1g-fragment02","1023","The ‘ fuzzy ’ nature of much geographically distributed data , the inherent errors in it , the effects of the processing algorithms used and the assumption of known interactions between variables ensures that completely routine use by unskilled users is unlikely to be possible in the foreseeable future ;"
"b1g-fragment02","1024","5 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1025","More detailed data are required for particular tasks as the role of CORINE grows ."
"b1g-fragment02","1026","The European Commission 's proposal for an environment agency ( see above ) will subsume the CORINE team and databases ."
"b1g-fragment02","1027","The global scale : NASA and GEMS/GRID"
"b1g-fragment02","1028","Without question , the largest ‘ player ’ in the global environment arena is NASA ."
"b1g-fragment02","1029","The organization has initiated many of the schemes which now are under discussion — the IGBP , for instance , has been strongly influenced by NASA proposals ."
"b1g-fragment02","1030","A summary of current activities and future plans is given in NASA ( 1988b ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1031","By way of example , current programmes are collecting global data on stratospheric ozone , on sea-surface and sea-ice variables and on the earth 's radiation budget ."
"b1g-fragment02","1032","Approved future programmes include the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite , the NASA Scatterometer and the joint NASA/CNES Ocean Topography Experiment ."
"b1g-fragment02","1033","In addition , however , funding has recently been approved for a much more ambitious scheme — the Earth Observing System ( EOS ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1034","This is conceived not as a set of hardware but as a comprehensive information system focused on the needs identified by the ESSC ( see above ) and anticipating somewhat those of IGBP ."
"b1g-fragment02","1035","It will collate data from the two proposed space station polar platforms , one European Space Agency platform , a Japanese one and also from the manned space station ."
"b1g-fragment02","1036","On this basis , a data flow of no less than 1 terabyte ( i.e. 10&sup12 ; bytes ) day is anticipated by the mid-1990s ."
"b1g-fragment02","1037","A major user of NASA data and skills has been the UN Environment Programme ."
"b1g-fragment02","1038","formed in the wake of the 1972 Stockholm conference , UNEP soon spawned the Global Environment Monitoring System ( GEMS ) as well as an international register of potentially toxic chemicals and a global network of sources to locate and provide technical , scientific and management information on the environment ."
"b1g-fragment02","1039","The need for a mechanism to handle the global environmental data was defined in the early 1980s and the Global Resources Information Database ( GRID ) resulted ."
"b1g-fragment02","1040","Mooneyhan ( 1988 ) has described the progress of the pilot stage of GRID which culminated in approval for a full operational phase ; GRID is now involved in integrating , storing and exploiting a variety of global environmental databases , mostly acquired from NASA ."
"b1g-fragment02","1041","In addition to the work being carried out in the UNEP HQ at Nairobi and in the GEMS/GRID site in Geneva , a series of GRID regional nodes are now being set up world-wide , each equipped with the same hardware and software and local subsets of the data ."
"b1g-fragment02","1042","The first of these is in Bangkok and another is to be opened in Latin America ."
"b1g-fragment02","1043","Moreover , national nodes are also being set up ; the recent IBM gift to GRID ( see above ) has ensured that powerful microcomputers have been installed in many African countries , together with national and continental data sets ."
"b1g-fragment02","1044","Training of unskilled staff to operate this equipment and to exploit the scientific data is now a major role for GRID staff ."
"b1g-fragment02","1045","Technical aspects and problems"
"b1g-fragment02","1046","It follows from much of the above that there are major challenges in use of environmental data ."
"b1g-fragment02","1047","These are best considered by itemizing characteristics of contemporary environmental monitoring and prediction :"
"b1g-fragment02","1048","1 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1049","The use of secondary data , rather than primary data collected by the data analyst ;"
"b1g-fragment02","1050","2 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1051","The need , at least with data on the terrestrial environment , for an inference process to extract useful information from the secondary ( and often proxy ) data ;"
"b1g-fragment02","1052","3 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1053","The data volumes collected are often voluminous even by the standards of contemporary computing facilities ;"
"b1g-fragment02","1054","4 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1055","The analyses carried out are often arcane in detail to all but a small group of ‘ high priests ’ ;"
"b1g-fragment02","1056","5 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1057","We have only a limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many environmental monitoring results , let alone of predictions ."
"b1g-fragment02","1058","Some of these characteristics are now addressed in slightly more detail ; it will be obvious that such problems merit a paper in themselves ."
"b1g-fragment02","1059","Remote sensing as a data collection process"
"b1g-fragment02","1060","As the need for more extensive , high-resolution yet consistent and up-to-date data becomes more pressing , increased use of remote sensing seems inevitable ."
"b1g-fragment02","1061","No other data collection methodology obviates the short distance variation in data sets induced by variations in data collection and aggregation methodology typically encountered between adjacent nation states ."
"b1g-fragment02","1062","The problem is now recognized , especially in Europe , and strenuous efforts are being made to harmonise the data sets ( e.g. through the use of standard classifications , such as that for land use produced by the Conference of European Statisticians in 1989 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1063","At present , however , ground-collected environmental data are far less than ideal ."
"b1g-fragment02","1064","Recognizing this , NASA ( 1988a ) concluded that forthcoming global science projects would need land surface altitude data at three resolutions : 1 km resolution in XY and 10–100 m resolution in Z on a global basis , 100 m XY resolution and 1–10 m resolution in Z for regional databases and 10 m XY resolution and 0.1–1 m in Z for local studies ."
"b1g-fragment02","1065","They argued that existing maps and digitized files from them are unable to meet these needs at global or regional scale and only remote sensing could help in the short term : the availability of stereometric data from the French SPOT satellite has already led to proposals for automated creation of global digital elevation models with a spatial ( XY ) resolution of about 30 m ( Muller 1989 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1066","For many terrestrial purposes , however , a substantial inference process must take place to convert the radiometric measurements into useful information ( in contrast , more direct measurements of sea state , etc. are possible ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1067","The value of this information is inherently dependent upon the quality of the inference process and that in turn depends upon the complexity of the scene , the spatial , temporal and spectral resolution of the sensors and the particular algorithms used ."
"b1g-fragment02","1068","Thus far , for instance , accuracies of land cover ( let alone what is often needed , i.e. land use ) determined from Landsat and SPOT imagery for the UK have rarely been higher than 70 per cent unless trivial classifications ( e.g. built/unbuilt land ) have been used ."
"b1g-fragment02","1069","One solution to this is to ‘ densify ’ the ground control and another is to use contextually based classifiers rather than the traditional , spectrally based ones ."
"b1g-fragment02","1070","But the ground conditions in some parts of Europe make good results extremely difficult to obtain : some areas of Portugal , for instance , have field sizes of only a few metres and exhibit multi-level and multi-seasonal cropping ."
"b1g-fragment02","1071","A further difficulty is the cost of the data in relation to its anticipated benefits ."
"b1g-fragment02","1072","Relatively few cost/benefit studies have yet been carried out except in such areas as crop prediction and ocean navigation ( where they are generally shown to be highly advantageous in saving someone else 's money ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1073","It may be that a study commissioned from contractors by the British National Space Centre will provide useful evidence on the cash value of remote sensing ; it is particularly timely in view of the appointment of Professor Pearce ( see above ) as the adviser to the UK Secretary of State for the Environment ."
"b1g-fragment02","1074","Other work on assessment of costs and benefits of such data have been carried out for the French government by Professor Didier ( 1990 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1075","Finally , since data are often costly to acquire , it follows that summaries of them e.g. The State of the European Environment report ( CEC 1988 ) and the Environmental Data Report of the UN EP ( GEMS MARC 1989 ) are of considerable value ."
"b1g-fragment02","1076","Equally , the ‘ signposting ’ role now being adopted by UNEP 's GRID project — which is expected to offer on-line access to a catalogue of environmental data sets and details of the responsible agencies in 1991 — is to be welcomed ."
"b1g-fragment02","1077","The data problem and partial solutions"
"b1g-fragment02","1078","The lack of harmonization of definitions and methods of collection of environmental data have already been outlined above ."
"b1g-fragment02","1079","In the European Community of 12 nation states , for instance , no less than eight procedures for calculating potential evapo-transpiration have been in use !"
"b1g-fragment02","1080","The need for harmonization is obvious and , in this respect , must follow from the successful pioneering achievements of EUROSTAT in harmonizing the definitions in trade , demographic and other ‘ social science ’ statistics ( see CEC 1990b ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1081","An additional and severe problem is that the volumes of data which are already collected are huge by the standards of only a decade ago ."
"b1g-fragment02","1082","By 1995/96 , they will be very much greater , notably from the EOS programme ."
"b1g-fragment02","1083","NASA has announced plans to collect up to 1 terabyte ( 10&sup12 ; bytes ) day ."
"b1g-fragment02","1084","Since remote sensing data sets ( especially those pertaining to terrestrial areas of the globe ) typically need much pre-processing to calibrate , transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurements of the radiation reflected or emitted by small areas of ground into useful ( e.g. land cover ) data , the processing power required is going to be formidable ."
"b1g-fragment02","1085","Other , non-remote-sensing data sets are smaller in volume but more complex in structure and in their characteristics ."
"b1g-fragment02","1086","To hold all of the 1/50 000 scale topographic map coverage alone for the European Community would probably require about 3 terabytes of storage ."
"b1g-fragment02","1087","Parenthetically , the form in which the data may be held can affect dramatically the scale of the problem faced ."
"b1g-fragment02","1088","It would be technically possible , for instance , to hold in less than 1 terabyte detailed information for every individual in the world , akin to that collected about everyone in the UK through the Census of Population ."
"b1g-fragment02","1089","In practice , legislation generally forbids such data being held thus and distributed in anything other than area aggregate form ; the cross-tabulations commonly employed ( e.g. to give tables of population numbers broken down by age and sex ) often result in a great multiplication of the data volumes ."
"b1g-fragment02","1090","This all presents major problems of data storage , handling ( especially for global data sets ) , display and dissemination ."
"b1g-fragment02","1091","Fortunately , technical developments have ensured that the increase in computing power per unit cost has been growing at about an order of magnitude every 6 years over the last three decades ."
"b1g-fragment02","1092","Indeed , this may grossly under-represent the present situation : the rapid spread of UNIX-based systems seems to facilitate competition and , at the time of writing , performance of workstations per unit cost seems to be increasing at about 50 per cent per annum ."
"b1g-fragment02","1093","Moreover , the advent of low-cost , high-density-storage devices like CD-ROMs may well make substantial data sets available even to those with modest computing power : a CD-ROM , for instance , can hold about 600 megabytes ( i.e. 10&sup6 ; bytes ) , can be reproduced currently for about £1 and read on a device costing about £400 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1094","Yet , despite such revolutionary changes in technology , novel solutions will still be required to make effective use of the new data sets ."
"b1g-fragment02","1095","One such solution is Goodchild and Yang 's ( 1989 ) scheme for a hierarchical spatial data structure to handle data for the spherical earth ."
"b1g-fragment02","1096","A particular problem is that little or no quantitative regard has been paid until recently to the effects of quality variation in environmental data ."
"b1g-fragment02","1097","The literature of the last few years is thronged with papers proposing that these must be taken into account — but with few realistic proposals on how this is to be achieved ."
"b1g-fragment02","1098","Goodchild ( 1988 ) has made perhaps the best summary of the problem and possible solutions to date ."
"b1g-fragment02","1099","Finally , relatively little emphasis has been given to the management of data as a corporate resource , available to a wide community : many environmental data are collected on a project-by-project basis and ‘ lost ’ once the urgency of the initial research is over ."
"b1g-fragment02","1100","However , the 1990 report of the Data and Facilities Working Group of the UK Inter-Agency Committee on Global Environmental Change argued strongly that planning for the dissemination and maintenance of such data was a vital role ."
"b1g-fragment02","1101","It also noted that ownership of and access to environmental data was a policy matter of the greatest importance ; this may be more difficult in ‘ within country ’ data than with global data since the latter are often already the subject of international exchange agreements at zero cost ."
"b1g-fragment02","1102","Global environmental research and the social sciences"
"b1g-fragment02","1103","Thus far , the emphasis has been very much on the natural science aspects of environmental monitoring and prediction ."
"b1g-fragment02","1104","That is unremarkable since the anticipation of such problems and assessments of some of their causes and magnitudes can only be made by environmental scientists ."
"b1g-fragment02","1105","Yet the consequences of any significant changes are a matter of the utmost concern to planners and to politicians at all levels , the quantification of the costs and benefits of alternative policy strategies is very much a matter for economists , and the adaptation of societies to massive change is a particular interest to sociologists and others ."
"b1g-fragment02","1106","For geographers — who span the conventional ( and now archaic ) dichotomy between the natural and the environmental sciences — all of these aspects need to be woven together to anticipate the likely spatial patterns of the effects of massive change , the redistributions in trade , health and wealth which they will bring about and the ‘ knock on ’ effects these consequences themselves will have on society and the environment ."
"b1g-fragment02","1107","For social scientists , then , environmental monitoring and prediction are a matter of considerable significance , especially as ‘ globalization ’ of markets and economies proceeds ."
"b1g-fragment02","1108","The Economic and Social Research Council ( ESRC ) commissioned two reports on global environmental change to guide or at least inform the allocation of research funding ."
"b1g-fragment02","1109","These reports ( Pearce 1990 ; Turner 1990 ) may be taken as informed views from at least the economists in the UK social science community on the social science aspects of global environmental change ."
"b1g-fragment02","1110","Pearce ( 1990 ) , for instance , presented an economist 's views of the high-priority topics for research as follows :"
"b1g-fragment02","1111","1 ."

"b1g-fragment02","1113","2 ."

"b1g-fragment02","1145","Some of it is being carried out : in March 1991 ESRC announced a £6m programme of research on Global Environmental Change ."
"b1g-fragment02","1146","However , perhaps most critical of all in the early stages is social science practice rather than research ."
"b1g-fragment02","1147","In the USA at least , there needs to be an improvement in scientists ' understandings of how to influence the allocation of funding for remedial measures or for further research ( see Kitsos and Ashe 1989 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1148","All too often , it seems that the coupling of an as yet imperfect scientific understanding to policy-making is tenuous ( see Table 9.2 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1149","Fortunately , considerable high-quality work has already begun on the legal , political and institutional aspects of global environmental change ( see , for instance , Nitze 1990 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1150","What next ?"
"b1g-fragment02","1151","The contents of this chapter have scarcely touched upon such important environmental research as the World Ocean Climate Experiment or the World Climate Research Programme ."
"b1g-fragment02","1152","Nor has there been any discussion of the growing requirement in the UK ( as elsewhere ) to carry out an environmental impact assessment for all major developments ."
"b1g-fragment02","1153","The consequences for some nations or subgroups in a population of being without access to environmental data or the tools for analysing them while others have such access are potentially profound — as the European Commission has recognized in issuing a directive on public access to environmental data ( CEC 1990d ) — yet space limitations have also precluded their discussion ."
"b1g-fragment02","1154","Despite these shortcomings dictated by the space available , what has been said should be sufficient to illustrate the enormous and diverse scope of environmental monitoring and prediction ."
"b1g-fragment02","1155","Such is its diversity that measuring the total expenditure on it seems quite impossible and the number of ‘ actors ’ already involved is vast ."
"b1g-fragment02","1156","What is clear , however , is that monitoring is rarely a simple exercise , that the time-scales of the sponsors of monitoring and environmental research are rarely long term though most science is inevitably of this nature and that the increasingly multinational nature of such work necessitates a degree of management not always present in local or nationally based schemes ."
"b1g-fragment02","1157","In these circumstances , it is scarcely surprising that there is evidence of international and interdisciplinary dispute , as Terney ( 1989 ) has chronicled in regard to IGBP ."
"b1g-fragment02","1158","Moreover , as Newby ( 1990 ) has pointed out , the complexities of environmental research have created a new kind of relationship between research and policy : ‘ in the past , … the relationship was predicated on the belief that science provided decision-makers with objective ‘ hard ’ facts on which to base their soft , value-ridden policies … ."
"b1g-fragment02","1159","But now we find scientists delivering only ‘ soft ’ , uncertain ‘ facts ’ to decision-makers facing ‘ hard ’ decisions . ’"
"b1g-fragment02","1160","Yet , even if all of this causes great uncertainty among scientists , it is still a reasonable prediction that a decade ahead will see both environmental monitoring and prediction treated as an everyday need and activity in major organizations ."
"b1g-fragment02","1161","We shall also see the existence of binding requirements upon national governments — certainly in the European Community — to collect at least basic environmental indicators in a harmonized form ( CEC 1990b ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1162","More than that , it seems highly likely that the social science aspects of environmental problems will underpin the actions of governments and international agencies ."
"b1g-fragment02","1163","Perhaps the single most important conclusion to be drawn from this review is that the monitoring , modelling and management of the global environment are tasks which uniquely require the integration of skills and techniques from many disciplines ."
"b1g-fragment02","1164","Building such research teams is essential ."
"b1g-fragment02","1165","Underlying it all , however , is one obvious fact : that the gathering and analysis of geographically distributed environmental data form the necessary starting-point for ensuring the success of our future on earth ."

"b1g-fragment02","1171","Introduction"
"b1g-fragment02","1172","Few areas of the application of GIS technology can be as socially significant , or environmentally relevant , as the management of emergencies and disasters due to natural and technological hazards ."
"b1g-fragment02","1173","Whether attempting to construct a database of resources for use in planning responses to nuclear emergencies , developing optimal routes for scheduling the safe transport of hazardous substances , or monitoring the health implications of a disaster , GIS can assist in identifying possibilities and formulating solutions ."
"b1g-fragment02","1174","The 1990s have been declared the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction ."
"b1g-fragment02","1175","Let us hope that G1S can , in some small way , help mitigate the suffering and hardship felt by all those afflicted by the effects of hazards which , as we have learnt with bitter recent experience in the UK , can occur in an untimely fashion in the most improbable of places ."
"b1g-fragment02","1176","Research on hazards is multidisciplinary and straddles the social , environmental and mathematical sciences ."
"b1g-fragment02","1177","If , for instance , we wish to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas resulting from a chemical explosion , assess its possible impact on human health and evaluate likely evacuation scenarios of the population at risk we would require , for example , a knowledge of atmospheric dispersion models , epidemiology and population distribution ."
"b1g-fragment02","1178","Some researchers suggest that hazards ( and emergencies that might result ) can be regarded as either natural or technological ."
"b1g-fragment02","1179","We shall elaborate on this simple division below but suggest here that the wealth of literature on the former ( see , for instance , Burton et al. 1978 and Perry 1981 ) has yet to be matched by a similar volume of work on the latter ."
"b1g-fragment02","1180","There are signs that this imbalance is being rectified ( Zeigler et al. 1983 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1181","Hazard research , like few other GIS application areas , is not only stretching the present technology to its limits but is a quite remarkable focus of international effort into several important research-related areas such as expert systems and simulation studies ."
"b1g-fragment02","1182","In this sense the scene is clearly one of hazard problems looking for improved GIS rather than for GIS looking for good problems , as is all too often the case ."
"b1g-fragment02","1183","Hazard research"
"b1g-fragment02","1184","What are hazards ?"
"b1g-fragment02","1185","Formally , a hazard can be defined as : ‘ a physical situation with a potential for human injury , damage to property , damage to the environment , or some combination of these ’ ( Health and Safety Executive 1989 : 30 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1186","A hazard is a threat which , given a set of circumstances , may become translated into a realized event ."
"b1g-fragment02","1187","What we choose to call this event depends upon factors such as its magnitude : we speak for instance of accidents , emergencies , disasters and catastrophes , each of which carries connotations concerning the scale of the event and each of which will have a set of human and/or environmental consequences ."
"b1g-fragment02","1188","On 30 March 1956 one of the most powerful volcanic disturbances this century , the Bezymianny eruption , occurred ."
"b1g-fragment02","1189","Few people noticed the event as it took place in an uninhabited part of Kamchatcka and caused no known casualties ."
"b1g-fragment02","1190","In contrast , the extrusion of a small volume of lava from a secondary cone on the slopes of Tristan da Cunha became the focus of global interest when , during October 1961 , the island 's lobster processing plant was smothered and the 300 people of the island 's only settlement were evacuated to the UK ."
"b1g-fragment02","1191","These two contrasting events emphasize the central fact that even natural hazards are not defined solely by the characteristics of the event but by the interaction of those events with the human occupation of the threatened area ."
"b1g-fragment02","1192","As noted above , the simple division of hazards is between those which are natural and those which are technological or human-induced ."
"b1g-fragment02","1193","Each of these may be further subdivided and the typology shown in Fig. 10.1 draws upon the classic work of Burton and Kates ( 1964 ) in separating geophysical from biological hazards and Zeigler et al. ( 1983 ) in distinguishing public ( or what we might call societal ) hazards from private ( individual ) ones ."
"b1g-fragment02","1194","The further subdivision of natural hazards is self-explanatory as is that of individual technological hazards ."
"b1g-fragment02","1195","Zeigler divides the public hazards into those which result from the production of raw materials and manufactured goods , those which originate in transport and transmission and those which threaten the public in their role as consumers ."
"b1g-fragment02","1196","The United Nations Disaster Relief Organization ( UNDRO ) has produced a classification of disasters , derived on the basis of case data ( Table 10.1 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1197","UNDRO recognizes three basic types of disaster : accidents , natural events , and other disasters ."
"b1g-fragment02","1198","The differentiation of accidents from other types is useful in the context of emergency planning and is not so clearly conveyed by other hazard typologies ."
"b1g-fragment02","1199","However , the temptation in all classification exercises is to produce partitional schemes and this should really be resisted here ."
"b1g-fragment02","1200","It is more useful ( Johnson 1983 ) to adopt a non-partitional scheme ( fig. 10.1 ) that recognizes , for instance , food poisoning as both a personal and consumer hazard , or lead pollution ( e.g. from car exhausts ) as both a meteorological event and technological hazard ( both public and private ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1201","An air crash ( as at Lockerbie ) affects an entire community directly , as well as being an occupational hazard and risk to the individual traveller ."
"b1g-fragment02","1202","Hillslope failure ( as at Aberfan in South Wales in 1966 ) is a geomorphic hazard but may arise because of raw material extraction ."
"b1g-fragment02","1203","Dutch elm disease is a floral hazard but is exacerbated by the transport of infected logs ."
"b1g-fragment02","1204","Hohensemer et al. ( 1983 ) make the important point that hazards are multidimensional in nature and suggest 12 dimensions along which any hazard may be scored ( see Table 10.2 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1205","These factors will , of course , be important in deciding on the role that GIS can play in hazard monitoring and emergency planning ."
"b1g-fragment02","1206","For instance , some events will persist briefly , have immediate consequences , minor transgenerational effects and have little or no potential for non-human mortality ( an air crash is an example ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1207","Others , such as a chemical explosion involving the release of a toxic gas , may persist for a week or more , have delayed consequences , may affect a future generation if the toxic chemical is mutagenic and may have a significant impact on plant and animal populations ."
"b1g-fragment02","1208","There may be more scope for a GIS approach in the latter than in the former situations ."
"b1g-fragment02","1209","The Hohensemer scheme is not , however , beyond criticism ."
"b1g-fragment02","1210","for example , can hazards really be thought of as having any intentionality ?"
"b1g-fragment02","1211","Industrial hazards and risk assessment"
"b1g-fragment02","1212","Once hazards have been identified there may follow efforts to assess the hazard risk ."
"b1g-fragment02","1213","By ‘ risk ’ we understand ‘ the likelihood of a specified undesired event occurring within a specified period or in specified circumstances ’ ( Health and Safety Executive 1989 : 30 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1214","It may , of course , be easier to quantify risk for natural hazards because of historical records and statistical estimation of recurrence intervals ."
"b1g-fragment02","1215","Technological hazards are more unpredictable and may be extremely rare , so that it becomes difficult to use probability concepts to quantify risk , especially those which rely on notions of relative frequency ."
"b1g-fragment02","1216","The identification of chemical hazards requires that the locations of sites be known , together with the dangerous substances stored or processed there ."
"b1g-fragment02","1217","In the UK ( see Petts 1988 for a splendid overview ) the Health and Safety Executive must be notified of sites where hazardous substances in excess of threshold limits are handled ."
"b1g-fragment02","1218","Such substances and thresholds include , for instance , 25 tonnes of flammable liquid petroleum gas and the explosive sodium chlorate , and 10 tonnes of toxic chlorine gas ."
"b1g-fragment02","1219","Some 1600 installations are notifiable , along with thousands of kilometres of pipelines ( mostly high-pressure natural gas transmission lines ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1220","Following a number of major accidents involving industrial activities ( including those at Flixborough , Humberside in 1974 ; Beek , the Netherlands in 1975 ; and Seveso and Manfredonia in Italy in 1976 ) , the EC issued a Directive on Major Accident Hazards ."
"b1g-fragment02","1221","The Directive , which is commonly referred to as the ‘ Seveso ’ Directive , was issued in June 1982 and in the UK its requirements were embodied in the Control of Major Accident Hazard ( CIMAH ) Regulations ( 1984 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1222","Among other things , these regulations require operators of hazardous installations to draw up on-site and off-site emergency plans and to give information to members of the public who live or work near such installations ( Houston 1987 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1223","There are presently about 300 CIMAH sites ."
"b1g-fragment02","1224","However , many potentially hazardous chemical installations are not covered by such regulations ."
"b1g-fragment02","1225","Clearly , a plant which stores 1 tonne less than is required for notification slips through the net , while large numbers of handling sites ( warehouses , for instance ) are not covered ."
"b1g-fragment02","1226","The regulations have obvious implications for G1S work , as illustrated below ."
"b1g-fragment02","1227","In Halton Borough , Cheshire , for instance , there are 13 notifiable installations , with over 20 000 people living within the defined ‘ consultation zones ’ ( Petts 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1228","It is also relevant to point out here the work of the Health and Safety Executive in developing techniques for quantitative risk assessment ( Health and Safety Executive 1989 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1229","Such techniques include the use of a ‘ risk assessment tool ’ ( RISKAT ) , inputs to which include data on wind direction and speed ; the output of which is a map of calculated risk contours ."
"b1g-fragment02","1230","In societal risk assessment ‘ it is also necessary to input data on the distribution of population around the installation ."
"b1g-fragment02","1231","This can be a difficult and time-consuming process , and inevitably some simplifying assumptions are needed ’ ( Health and Safety Executive 1989 : 17 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1232","Again , the G1S implications are clear and are discussed below ."
"b1g-fragment02","1233","Hazardous waste disposal"
"b1g-fragment02","1234","The disposal of both nuclear and non-nuclear wastes has proved to be of major public concern in recent years ."
"b1g-fragment02","1235","The rather clumsy handling by NIREX of the search for sites to store low- and intermediate-level wastes , together with very recent worries about the import of toxic wastes such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , are but two examples of such concern in the UK ."
"b1g-fragment02","1236","However , while the former has been given considerable attention by geographers ( summarized by Openshaw et al. 1989 ) there has been relatively little such work in the UK on the disposal of non-nuclear wastes ."
"b1g-fragment02","1237","This contrasts with the situation in the USA ( Greenberg and Anderson 1984 ) , where the clean-up of abandoned sites is a priority ."
"b1g-fragment02","1238","Certainly , in terms of the volume of waste generated in the UK non-nuclear hazardous industrial wastes should be high on the environmental agenda ; while less than 1 million tonnes of all nuclear wastes were generated in 1985–86 , 10 times that amount were generated of hazardous wastes ( Openshaw et al. 1989 : 13 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1239","Attention should be drawn to the three Annual Reports of the Hazardous Waste Inspectorate ( now merged with other branches of the DoE to form Her Majesty 's Inspectorate of Pollution ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1240","These contain some valuable material on disposal practices , and volumes of waste generated and disposed of by each waste regulation authority ( WRA ) — counties in England , districts in Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland ."
"b1g-fragment02","1241","Each WRA is required to produce a waste disposal plan and these are starting to appear ."
"b1g-fragment02","1242","They too contain useful material on , for instance , the locations of sites , though individual site licences must be consulted for details of what each is permitted to take in the way of hazardous wastes ."
"b1g-fragment02","1243","What is not known is information on the locations of former sites , at which quite toxic materials may have been dumped , though recent work by Egger ( 1989 ) in Austria has mapped a vast number of such sites ."
"b1g-fragment02","1244","It is these , rather than existing , licensed sites which should be a focus of research activity , particularly when examining possible links to ill health ."
"b1g-fragment02","1245","We simply do not have enough evidence yet to back up the claim that ‘ people are almost certainly ill , dead , or dying because of these sloppy waste disposal activities ’ ( Openshaw et al. 1989 : 12 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1246","Research is in progress , however , to assess possible health effects of poor incineration ( Diggle et al. 1990 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1247","Particular attention should be focused on hospital incinerators , since these have been subject to Crown immunity for many years and most are technically ill-equipped to burn at sufficiently high temperatures for adequate disposal of wastes ( Gatrell and Lovett 1991 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1248","We need to produce an inventory of all such sites , together with a publicly available , comprehensive database on all sites accepting hazardous industrial wastes ."
"b1g-fragment02","1249","Emergency planning"
"b1g-fragment02","1250","It is convenient to retain the nuclear/non-nuclear distinction when discussing the background to emergency planning ."
"b1g-fragment02","1251","Nuclear emergency planning in the UK has been reviewed by Matthews and Pepper ( 1981 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1252","Nuclear power stations must prepare a plan and submit this to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and Health and Safety Executive for approval ."
"b1g-fragment02","1253","Evacuation plans are required to cover an area within a distance of 2.4 km ; these detail the roles to be played by the emergency services ."
"b1g-fragment02","1254","The very narrow emergency planning zones contrast with those in the USA ( Collins 1981 ) , where planning is required up to 16 km from the site to cover exposure to radiation plumes ."
"b1g-fragment02","1255","Local authorities in the UK that have declared themselves ‘ nuclear-free ’ have been highly critical of British planning , calling for an extension of emergency zones to at least 24 km ."
"b1g-fragment02","1256","Zeigler et al. ( 1983 ) should be consulted for material relating to evacuation behaviour in the wake of the incident at Three Mile Island ."
"b1g-fragment02","1257","In the UK little work of any description seems to have been done on human behaviour in the aftermath of releases of hazardous substances , nor is much available on public attitudes to emergency planning ."
"b1g-fragment02","1258","Indeed , no major studies of evacuation due to hazards have been undertaken in recent times and this is a widely recognized deficiency which no research funding body seems willing to rectify ."
"b1g-fragment02","1259","In the USA on the other hand , a good deal of useful research in these areas has been undertaken ."
"b1g-fragment02","1260","This research is brought together in very useful reports produced by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , Tennessee ( Sorenson et al. 1987 ; Vogt and Sorenson 1987 ) and the Disaster Research Centre , University of Delaware ."
"b1g-fragment02","1261","Perry ( 1985 ) has written an interesting book on emergency planning and evacuation , covering both natural and technological hazards ."
"b1g-fragment02","1262","For him , comprehensive emergency planning and management involve : prevention , protection , response and restoration ."
"b1g-fragment02","1263","By prevention we understand the elimination or reduction in risk , perhaps by adequate zoning or safe routeing of shipments , for instance ."
"b1g-fragment02","1264","Included in protection are methods for detecting likely hazard events and in warning those likely to be affected ."
"b1g-fragment02","1265","Response includes search and rescue ( including the need to cope with secondary threats such as contamination of water supplies after an explosion , or fire following an earthquake ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1266","As Perry and others have noted , relatively few resources are devoted to the first two aspects , the bulk going to response and restoration ( rebuilding ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1267","It should be clear from this brief description that these issues are inherently geographical ."
"b1g-fragment02","1268","In one of the few studies of evacuation behaviour after a non-nuclear hazard event Liverman and Wilson ( 1981 ) give weight to this argument ."
"b1g-fragment02","1269","In 1979 a train carrying chlorine , liquid petroleum , toluene and propane was derailed in Mississauga , Ontario , causing a series of explosions ."
"b1g-fragment02","1270","This led to the evacuation of 250 000 people which , although staggered over several days , led to great pressure on transport arteries ."
"b1g-fragment02","1271","An important finding was that many relied on their own transport and went to stay with friends and relatives some distance away , rather than relying on the 19 official evacuation reception centres ."
"b1g-fragment02","1272","Despite this , the evacuation was successful , partly because the accident occurred at a weekend and the immediately affected area was sparsely populated ."
"b1g-fragment02","1273","In addition , the police were well prepared , stimulated largely by implementing a plan designed more to cope with an emergency at the nearby Toronto International Airport than for the event in question ."
"b1g-fragment02","1274","It is not without interest to note that in the USA there is a Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , established in 1978 , charged with dealing with all types of emergency planning and management ."
"b1g-fragment02","1275","In the UK there is no equivalent , though the spate of disasters in the past 4 years ( involving over 1000 lives lost ) has led to several calls for such a national body to be established ."
"b1g-fragment02","1276","Natural hazards"
"b1g-fragment02","1277","In this short space it is not possible to go into any depth on the nature of particular natural hazards but only to highlight those aspects relevant to GIS ."
"b1g-fragment02","1278","Needless to say , the study of natural hazards is important , a statement brought into sharp focus by the fact that natural hazards account for up to 4 per cent of total deaths in the world each year ( Mitchell , 1974 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1279","In 1970 , for example , more than 200 000 people died in the cyclone and flooding of Bangladesh and in 1979 the hurricanes David and Frederick caused more than $3bn damage in the USA ."
"b1g-fragment02","1280","Shah ( 1983 ) made a comprehensive investigation of natural disaster reports for the period 1974–80 and concluded that both disaster frequency and magnitude ( measured in terms of lives lost ) are increasing ."
"b1g-fragment02","1281","High death tolls are still a characteristic of less developed , low-income countries ."
"b1g-fragment02","1282","Surprisingly , fog is the third most important hazard in Europe after floods and volcanoes ."
"b1g-fragment02","1283","Research on natural hazards has a long tradition in geography going back more than half a century ."
"b1g-fragment02","1284","Much of the impetus for such research arose in the USA from observations on river basin management and the need to reduce flood damage ."
"b1g-fragment02","1285","The vast majority of natural hazards studies have ignored the physical nature of the events per se and have concentrated on behavioural issues such as the perception and estimation of hazards ."
"b1g-fragment02","1286","This emphasis is partly due to the background of the researchers involved ( many are human geographers and sociologists ) and partly because it is only really since the Second World War that major hazards have been monitored systematically , culminating , of course , in the last decade or so in the use of satellite technology ."
"b1g-fragment02","1287","Brief reference to two examples of natural hazards may illustrate the potential relevance of a GIS approach , applications of which are considered below ."
"b1g-fragment02","1288","Jones et al. ( 1989 ) have examined the distribution of some 8500 landslides in the UK ."
"b1g-fragment02","1289","Their maps show clearly an increased propensity for landsliding in the north and west of the UK ."
"b1g-fragment02","1290","More to the point , however , is the fact that this distribution can be modelled in terms of slopes , rainfall , rock types and so on ."
"b1g-fragment02","1291","In other words the actual hazard distribution can be understood and areas at risk identified ."
"b1g-fragment02","1292","The potential benefits to insurance companies , engineers and planners are clear ."
"b1g-fragment02","1293","Second , a well-known winter hazard in the UK , with marked spatial localization , is fog ."
"b1g-fragment02","1294","Predictive models of its distribution have clear implications for road and air safety ."
"b1g-fragment02","1295","Perry ( 1981 ) describes a fog potential index that is a function of local topography , environmental features affecting fog formation and distance from standing water bodies ."
"b1g-fragment02","1296","Reliance is currently placed on a network of monitoring stations , often sparsely located and frequently outside fog-prone areas ; GIS could implement a predictive model based on digitized map features and indeed the model could also be used in site allocation studies for airports and the like ."
"b1g-fragment02","1297","The majority of natural hazard research has focused on single hazards but of course any area may be prone to more than one hazard type ."
"b1g-fragment02","1298","This idea led Hewitt and Burton ( 1971 ) to develop the concept of ‘ all-hazards-at-a-place ’ ."
"b1g-fragment02","1299","To achieve this they concentrated on the whole_-0.1 spectrum of damaging events in an area and explored their aggregate impact ."
"b1g-fragment02","1300","The implications for GIS in the development of ‘ hazardousness ’ indices are obvious and if time-series data are available there is the potential to produce a variety of probability maps ."
"b1g-fragment02","1301","The collection of historical data on natural hazards is important since it is clear that their spatial pattern varies through time ."
"b1g-fragment02","1302","Many areas that appear to be hazard-free on current maps may merely by passing through a temporary period of quiescence ."
"b1g-fragment02","1303","This is perhaps best illustrated with reference to earthquakes ."
"b1g-fragment02","1304","For example , in 1692 , the whole of southern England was affected by an earthquake whose epicentre was located in what is now Belgium ; a good deal of minor structural damage was inflicted ( Morse 1983 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1305","Presumably the builders of the Channel Tunnel are aware of this ?"
"b1g-fragment02","1306","Environmental epidemiology"
"b1g-fragment02","1307","This is , of course , a vast subject area , embracing the impact of the natural and technological environments on human health ."
"b1g-fragment02","1308","It covers , for instance , the associations between water and air pollution and ill health , links between geological and pedological environments and ill health , as well as associations between specific technological hazards ( e.g. high-voltage power lines ) and possible health effects ."
"b1g-fragment02","1309","We can only consider a small fraction of this work here ; little consideration is given to occupational environments , for instance ."
"b1g-fragment02","1310","In the UK such research is widespread though there are specialist environmental epidemiology research institutes at Southampton and Cardiff ( funded by the Medical Research Council ) , and others at the University of Surrey ( Robens Institute ) and at the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ."
"b1g-fragment02","1311","The latter houses the Small Area Health Statistics Research Unit ( SAHSRU ) , which has a specific remit to conduct research into morbidity and mortality at local scales ( Elliot 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1312","The SAHSRU liaises closely with OPCS ."
"b1g-fragment02","1313","The kinds of databases used by these groups are discussed below ."
"b1g-fragment02","1314","Greenberg ( 1983 ) and a collection of papers in Greenberg ( 1987 ) review some of the literature on environmental epidemiology ."
"b1g-fragment02","1315","It seems worth stating at the outset that there are two ways geographical research in this general area can proceed ."
"b1g-fragment02","1316","One is to collect morbidity and mortality data ( usually the latter is more widely available , though the former more useful ) and to examine spatial distributions for clustering ."
"b1g-fragment02","1317","This has itself generated a substantial literature ( see the papers in Elliot 1988 for an overview ) and is nowhere better exemplified than in Openshaw 's geographical analysis machine ( see Ch. 2 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1318","We then search retrospectively for evidence of possible environmental associations ."
"b1g-fragment02","1319","An alternative approach is to begin by hypothesizing an environmental determinant of ill health and to collect data to test an explicit hypothesis ."
"b1g-fragment02","1320","If an association is suggested then we would want to collect data in other areas to assess the hypothesis further ."
"b1g-fragment02","1321","Of course , these two approaches are not clear-cut in practice ; in many cases the hypotheses of interest will have themselves been generated by inductive mapping ."
"b1g-fragment02","1322","One example of an hypothesis which has been given serious attention in recent years is the possible link between electromagnetic fields generated by high-voltage power lines or supply cables and ill health ."
"b1g-fragment02","1323","Some work ( Perry et al. 1981 ) suggested associations with mental illness and suicide , while others ( e.g. Wertheimer and Leeper 1982 ) have examined links to various cancers , including leukaemias ."
"b1g-fragment02","1324","A good bibliography is provided in Perry and Pearl ( 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1325","The Central Electricity Generating Board ( now privatized and split into two companies ) is funding a large-scale , 2-year project to assess links to childhood cancer , while another recently announced study aims to look at links to sudden infant death ."
"b1g-fragment02","1326","One obvious problem , with implications for any GIS input , is that the effects are highly localized , with little measurable field effect more than a few dozen metres away from the route centre-lines ."
"b1g-fragment02","1327","Accuracy of digital data collection ( either of the power lines or residential locations ) is paramount ."
"b1g-fragment02","1328","There seems to be a growing interest in examining associations between ill health and the geological environment ."
"b1g-fragment02","1329","GIS work in this field ( e.g. Matthews 1989 ) is reviewed later , but we note here the work of the applied geochemistry group at Imperial College ( responsible for a series of atlases on regional geochemistry ) and the existence of a Society for Environmental Geochemistry and Health ."
"b1g-fragment02","1330","One area of recent debate concerns radon gas and its links to lung cancer ."
"b1g-fragment02","1331","This is taken very seriously in the USA , where the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 10 000–20 000 deaths from lung cancer each year are due to radon gas exposure ."
"b1g-fragment02","1332","Estimates from Scandinavia suggest that 10–30 per cent of such deaths are caused by exposure to radon ( Richardson 1988 : 270–81 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1333","The gas is trapped in well-insulated houses and is produced by the decay of uranium in rocks and soil ; thus it has been measured at high concentrations in parts of Cornwall and Devon ."
"b1g-fragment02","1334","There are great difficulties in assessing health effects , however , since exposure varies greatly from house to house within small neighbourhoods ."
"b1g-fragment02","1335","Carefully designed case-control studies are therefore required to measure the separate effect of radon exposure after controlling for smoking behaviour and other risk factors ."
"b1g-fragment02","1336","Other health concerns which might merit attention by those involved in the Regional Research Laboratory ( RRL ) initiative include air and water pollution ."
"b1g-fragment02","1337","The debate about lead pollution from vehicle exhaust emissions is well known ; less publicity has been given to PAHs ( polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons ) , a product of combustion processes and known to be carcinogenic ( Lioy and Daisey 1987 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1338","Research at the North West Regional Research Laboratory ( NWRRL ) aims to create buffers around busy roads and junctions and to use data from the Cancer Registry to examine possible links between proximity to such sources of pollution and prevalence of lung cancer ."
"b1g-fragment02","1339","Those with an interest in health and air pollution should note the availability of a very detailed database from the Warren Springs Laboratory , containing details of smoke and sulphur dioxide emissions at a large number of sites in the UK ."
"b1g-fragment02","1340","The possible link between nitrates in water and stomach cancer is the subject of much debate ( Beresford 1985 ) , as is the association between aluminium content and Alzheimer 's disease ."
"b1g-fragment02","1341","The problems of assessing such links are , of course , huge , but there is scope for a contribution ."
"b1g-fragment02","1342","The role of GIS in hazard management scenarios — examples"
"b1g-fragment02","1343","As we have already implied , GIS has a role to play in all aspects of hazard research , from hazard monitoring , risk assessment and emergency planning to coping with an event and evaluating its consequences ."
"b1g-fragment02","1344","The examples described below illustrate all these , though as yet there do not appear to be many instances of disasters in the management of which GIS has played a significant part ."
"b1g-fragment02","1345","Technological hazards , emergency planning and GIS"
"b1g-fragment02","1346","A considerable amount of research has been undertaken to apply GIS methods to evacuation scenarios around hazardous sites ."
"b1g-fragment02","1347","Much of this research has concentrated on network analysis of the road system ."
"b1g-fragment02","1348","Reference was made above to so-called CIMAH sites , major hazardous installations for which on-site and off-site emergency plans must be prepared ."
"b1g-fragment02","1349","Early research at the NWRRL focused on developing a GIS for use by the police and county emergency planning officers in Cumbria that would aid in the management of a possible explosion at a chemical factory in Whitehaven , west Cumbria ( Vincent et al. 1988 ; Dunn 1989 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1350","The police required a portable system that could be implemented on an IBM-compatible microcomputer ."
"b1g-fragment02","1351","This was written at the NWRRL using FORTRAN 77 and the Graphical Kernel System ."
"b1g-fragment02","1352","The GIS is menu-based and is exceptionally user-friendly ( Pl. 10.1 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1353","It opens with an outline map and the superimposition of the rather rigid zones used by the emergency planners ."
"b1g-fragment02","1354","Full zoom facilities are available at any stage ."
"b1g-fragment02","1355","In any emergency it is of course vital to have high-quality data on the distribution of population and resources ."
"b1g-fragment02","1356","The system incorporates digitized data on the distribution of all domestic and non-domestic properties in the town together with digitized road centre-line data ."
"b1g-fragment02","1357","Both sets of data were provided by Pinpoint Analysis Ltd , who are undertaking this digitizing task for the entire country ."
"b1g-fragment02","1358","Other spatially referenced data incorporated into the system include those on the distribution of schools , medical and transport services which can be displayed and supplementary information about them obtained ."
"b1g-fragment02","1359","The GIS permits population estimates to be made for any arbitrary rectangular region on the map ."
"b1g-fragment02","1360","Most significantly , it incorporates a shortest path algorithm which uses the road network to find optimal routes between user-defined start and end nodes ."
"b1g-fragment02","1361","Although predating the RRL initiative by several years — and , indeed the emergence of GIS as a major research area — we should remind ourselves of Openshaw 's work on appraising nuclear reactor sites ."
"b1g-fragment02","1362","Using what would now be called GIS skills , Openshaw ( 1980 ) examined over 13 000 1 km grid squares in the UK which intersect the coastline and related these to data from the 1971 Census ( which were made available for such grid squares ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1363","He demonstrated that there is an abundance of ‘ remote ’ sites , in contrast to the official view that such sites were increasingly hard to find ."
"b1g-fragment02","1364","He suggested that in early spatial searches for sites ‘ only a small number were ever identified in the first place because rigorous searches could not be performed by manual means with poor quality data ’ ( Openshaw 1980 : 289 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1365","Heywood and Cornelius ( 1989 ) have shown how GIS can be used for monitoring possible radiation releases and thus the relevance of GIS in nuclear emergency planning and monitoring ."
"b1g-fragment02","1366","They propose a national radiological spatial information system and , in a pilot project in Cumbria , have integrated several layers of data within ARC/INFO to show what this might involve ( Fig. 10.2 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1367","Such data include those from the Population and Agricultural Censuses as well as point data from rain gauge sites and radiation monitoring stations ."
"b1g-fragment02","1368","As an example , the system is used to determine restriction zones for the movement of sheep after the explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1369","This is done by finding areas of high rainfall and parishes with high sheep populations ."
"b1g-fragment02","1370","The map overlay of point and area information shows generally good agreement with the restriction zones imposed by the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food , with the exception of a small area to the south-east of Cumbria , bordering on Lancashire ."
"b1g-fragment02","1371","The British government carried out a review of its arrangements for handling nuclear accidents overseas following the Chernobyl accident ."
"b1g-fragment02","1372","The DoE , through Her Majesty 's Inspectorate of Pollution ( HMIP ) , was given the task of co-ordinating a national response plan , installing the radiation monitoring network and acting as lead government department in an emergency ( HMSO 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1373","The monitoring network has become known as the radioactive incident monitoring network ( RIMNET ) and has , as its prime responsibility , the detection of abnormal increases in radiation levels within the UK of the kind that might arise from an overseas nuclear accident ."
"b1g-fragment02","1374","The full implementation of the RIMNET system will take some time ."
"b1g-fragment02","1375","By the end of 1988 gamma radiation dose monitors had been installed at 46 meteorological stations as part of phase 1 of the development programme ."
"b1g-fragment02","1376","Radiation readings are taken every hour at each station and are transmitted to a central computer which analyses the data ."
"b1g-fragment02","1377","The current criterion for alert is two readings of more than three times normal background , either successively at the same site or simultaneously at two adjacent sites ."
"b1g-fragment02","1378","The dissemination of information in the event of an incident is dealt with at three levels : the first is the normal system of press notices ; the second is the use of teletext and viewdata ( Ceefax and Prestel ) to get direct to members of the public at their homes or places of work ; the third is the use of Telecom Gold electronic mail to get more technical details to various official bodies , such as water authorities ( Jackson 1989 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1379","Phase 2 of the RIMNET scheme will be completed by the end of 1991 when between 80 and 90 monitoring sites will have been established ."
"b1g-fragment02","1380","Given very wide regional and local variations in deposition , questions must be raised about the effectiveness of such a small network ; local authorities will need to supplement it with their own networks ."
"b1g-fragment02","1381","There are important analytical problems to be addressed concerning the siting of such monitoring equipment and these are elaborated on later ."
"b1g-fragment02","1382","Abroad , Kaspar ( 1981 ) has discussed a computer-based exercise , with GIS overtones , involving the simulated evacuation of the population living in the vicinity of the Neckarwestheim nuclear power plant in Baden Württemberg ."
"b1g-fragment02","1383","In the scenario he outlines , an area affected by radioactive releases is determined , the population within that area is allocated to reception areas ( with capacity constraints ) , evacuation routes are identified and traffic restrictions implemented ."
"b1g-fragment02","1384","Little detail is provided , however , and it is thus difficult to evaluate his work fully ."
"b1g-fragment02","1385","Dangermond ( 1985 ) describes the use of the ARC/INFO NETWORK module for use in emergency planning situations ."
"b1g-fragment02","1386","He describes how a road network is digitized and subsequently analysed using allocation , districting and routeing algorithms ."
"b1g-fragment02","1387","Allocation determines which arcs in the network will be allocated to a particular node or centre ; districting makes it possible to outline rapidly sets of polygons in order to define specific areas of interest ( districts ) and to summarize their characteristics ; routeing provides a minimum path algorithm through the network , the arcs of which can be assigned weights according to road conditions , road capacity and so on ."
"b1g-fragment02","1388","Dangermond gives several examples in his paper including the use of NETWORK for the allocation of emergency vehicles , optimum routeing of fire engines from garages to the accident scene and the movement of spills through sewers and river networks ."
"b1g-fragment02","1389","When combined with the other facilities in ARC/INFO , quite complex disaster management scenarios can be handled ."
"b1g-fragment02","1390","For example , earthquake fault zones can be combined with data on housing density and structural details to predict earthquake damage levels and these data then related to the network model ."
"b1g-fragment02","1391","Vincent ( 1989 ) illustrates the use of ARC/INFO and its NETWORK module for finding safe routes for chlorine transhipment on the road and rail systems of north-west England ( Pl. 10.2 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1392","In this case , population density data for a 1 km buffer on either side of network arcs were overlaid on the network itself so as to act as weights for the minimum path algorithm ."
"b1g-fragment02","1393","Chosen routes were those which minimized population rather than distance ."
"b1g-fragment02","1394","Hazardous waste disposal"
"b1g-fragment02","1395","There can be little doubt that a GIS approach has wide applicability in all sorts of location problems where the goal is to minimize ( rather than , as conventionally , maximize ) accessibility to a population ."
"b1g-fragment02","1396","A particularly good application is to the search for potential sites for the disposal of nuclear and non-nuclear ( but none the less hazardous ) wastes ."
"b1g-fragment02","1397","We discuss here some relevant work on the siting of facilities for the disposal of nuclear wastes before examining those for non-nuclear wastes ."
"b1g-fragment02","1398","The major contribution to informed debate about the search for sites for the disposal of nuclear wastes has come from a group of geographers ( Openshaw et al. 1989 ) and a GIS approach to this problem can pay high dividends ."
"b1g-fragment02","1399","The work of Carver ( see Openshaw et al. 1989 : Ch. 7 ) is an interesting example ."
"b1g-fragment02","1400","One advantage is the ability to model a range of alternatives by allowing particular criteria to enter or be omitted from the polygon overlay operation ."
"b1g-fragment02","1401","Conceptually , what is offered is little more than an automated ‘ sieve mapping ’ that land-use planners have used for many years , but the whole_-0.438 procedure is speeded up by many orders of magnitude using GIS software ."
"b1g-fragment02","1402","The authors examine both near-surface sites and deep repositories ( which use more restricted population criteria and allow offshore locations to enter ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1403","Data layers include geological maps , conservation areas , transport routes , petrochemical facilities and demographic data ."
"b1g-fragment02","1404","As different layers are added sequentially we see how the proportion of available land shrinks ( Pl. 10.3 ) ; for instance , when geological criteria are set in the search for a deep repository , 25 per cent of land area remains and the addition of the population density layer reduces this to 24 per cent ."
"b1g-fragment02","1405","However , adding a proximity to transport constraint lowers this to 12 per cent ; and so on ."
"b1g-fragment02","1406","We can not pretend GIS is a solution to the political problems of negotiation and justification but at the very least the openness of the procedures goes some way towards satisfying a worried public ."
"b1g-fragment02","1407","GIS research into site selection for non-nuclear hazardous waste has been almost exclusively conducted in North America and has yet to be matched in the UK ."
"b1g-fragment02","1408","Jensen and Christiansen ( 1986 ) , working in the south-eastern USA , use a raster approach ( with a pixel resolution of 20 m&sup2 ; ) and Boolean overlay to ‘ weed out ’ particular sites , such as those which are poorly drained , environmentally sensitive or inaccessible ( see also Stewart 1987 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1409","Environmental monitoring of sites for the disposal of toxic waste is of particular concern in the USA ."
"b1g-fragment02","1410","The Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) legislation of 1980 ( ‘ Superfund ’ ) requires the cleaning up of the worst landfill sites , of which some 800 had been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency by 1986 ( Foresman 1986 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1411","A major worry has been the threat posed by groundwater pollution and some research has been conducted on using GIS to monitor this ( Merchant et al. 1987 ; Barringer et al. 1987 ; von Braun 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1412","This is an important topic since 95 per cent of rural households in the USA consume only groundwater , while half the US population consumes at least some groundwater ( Merchant et al. 1987 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1413","Clearly , the research demands access to exceptionally good environmental data , usually in three dimensions ."
"b1g-fragment02","1414","As Foresman ( 1986 ) suggests , we might expect remote sensing technology to play a major role ."
"b1g-fragment02","1415","Merchant et al. ( 1987 ) for example , use the image processing system ERDAS to construct an index of vulnerability to groundwater pollution ; this uses variables such as depth to water table , soil type , slope and so on ( see Estes et al. 1987 for a similar approach ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1416","Barringer et al. ( 1987 ) overlay data on soil type and geology with that of groundwater quality ( hardness and corrosivity measures ) and build a linear model which shows that the background environmental variables are good predictors of the water quality indices ."
"b1g-fragment02","1417","Again , a raster-based approach is used ."
"b1g-fragment02","1418","A further example is work by von Braun ( 1988 ) who uses pMAP to look at exposure of organic and metallic compounds in groundwater in the vicinity of Tucson airport , Arizona ."
"b1g-fragment02","1419","Using plume models that predict the movement of contaminants she is able to intersect the results with data on current well locations and to assess which water supply areas are worst contaminated ."
"b1g-fragment02","1420","Overlaying the results with residential location data provides ‘ maps delineating location-specific exposures for each residence in each time-period ’ ( von Braun 1988 ; 1160 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1421","In principle , it is then possible to compare such ‘ doses ’ with epidemiological data , once again indicating a link from a hazard event to assessment of health outcomes ."
"b1g-fragment02","1422","Attention should be drawn to Foresman 's comment that the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) ( at the EROS Data Centre ) have successfully linked ARC/INFO to a model of groundwater flow ( Foresman 1986 : 260 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1423","This kind of link between GIS and other modelling programs is to be warmly welcomed and parallels work at the NWRRL in linking GIS and air pollution plume models ."
"b1g-fragment02","1424","Natural hazards and disaster management"
"b1g-fragment02","1425","Several studies in recent papers have shown the effectiveness of GIS in mitigating the effects of major natural hazards ."
"b1g-fragment02","1426","Berke and Ruch ( 1985 ) , for example , describe a GIS for assessing the impacts of hurricanes on the Texas Gulf coast ."
"b1g-fragment02","1427","Hurricane damage through high winds and tidal surges causes an immense amount of destruction and poses a major threat to many coastal communities in the USA ."
"b1g-fragment02","1428","It has been estimated , for example , that during the mid 1970s some 50 million US citizens were subject to hurricane winds of over 160 km/h and 6 million were subject to hurricane surge ( Brinkman 1975 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1429","The system described by Berke and Ruch ( 1985 ) is raster-based and has an interesting modelling component called SLOSH ( Sea , Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1430","SLOSH is able to estimate still water surge by grid cell for various hurricane intensities , angles of approach to the shoreline , forward movement speeds and landfall locations ."
"b1g-fragment02","1431","Additional algorithms are used to model total building damage costs for each grid cell based on water-depth and speed-depth rating curves ."
"b1g-fragment02","1432","Hobeika and Jamei ( 1985 ) describe the MASSeVACuation ( MASSVAC ) simulation software designed to analyse and evaluate traffic evacuation plans given a natural disaster in an urban area ."
"b1g-fragment02","1433","The system comprises three interrelated modules : community and disaster type characteristics module ; population distribution module ; network evacuation module ."
"b1g-fragment02","1434","The type of natural disaster determines the time period within which the road network has to be evacuated ."
"b1g-fragment02","1435","The control and management strategies are directly correlated to each specific disaster scenario ."
"b1g-fragment02","1436","MASSVAC is quite flexible and various user-defined road network options are available such as : traffic signal timings on the road network ; one-way traffic ; reserved lanes for special vehicles such as those of the emergency services ."
"b1g-fragment02","1437","Hobeika and Jamei have tested MASSVAC on various evacuation scenarios for Virginia Beach City in order to determine evacuation times for flood and hurricane conditions ."
"b1g-fragment02","1438","In general , they suggest that the model provided reasonable and reliable evacuation times ."
"b1g-fragment02","1439","Southworth et al. ( 1989 ) have enhanced the MASSVAC model with the addition of a colour graphics module which they call MVOPL ."
"b1g-fragment02","1440","This module has been developed using IBM 's Graphics Kernel System and provides a number of display screens ."
"b1g-fragment02","1441","The most interesting are those which portray population flows as scaled ribbons on the network diagram , and evacuation shelter capacities as bar diagrams ."
"b1g-fragment02","1442","The diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation ."
"b1g-fragment02","1443","In dry parts of the world , such as Australia , forest and bush fires are an important natural hazard and some attention has been given to the ways in which GIS might help examine their potential impacts ."
"b1g-fragment02","1444","Kessell ( 1988 ) describes a PC-based GIS called PREPLAN ( PRistine Environment Planning LANguage ) which is a natural area management , land-use planning and fire modelling system developed for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service , PREPLAN comprises four modules : a simple raster-based GIS ; a grid cell resource database ; a wide range of vegetation , fuel , fire behaviour , erosion and land-use models ; tabular , statistical and colour graphics output system ."
"b1g-fragment02","1445","With this system real-time fire growth can be modelled , taking into account changes in terrain , fuel and temporal changes in the weather ."
"b1g-fragment02","1446","Kessell points out that uncontrollable fires are recurrent phenomena in many parts of Australia , causing damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars and significant loss of life ."
"b1g-fragment02","1447","Systems such as PREPLAN can provide the user with sound models of the behaviour patterns of fire and are therefore of enormous value in land-use planning ."
"b1g-fragment02","1448","One of the most widespread natural hazards is flooding , and the potential for loss of property , risk to life and general social disruption is large ."
"b1g-fragment02","1449","One interesting example of a GIS approach to flood damage estimation is the ANUFLOOD package which was developed in the early 1980s following detailed flood damage studies for flood-prone coastal towns in northern New South Wales , Australia ( Smith and Greenaway , 1988 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1450","The ANUFLOOD system requires locational and building type data on individual properties , stage-damage curves relating the average damage that would result from overfloor flooding to differing depths for each property type , and lastly , flood frequency in terms of flood height expressed as a probability ."
"b1g-fragment02","1451","Output from the system is both tabular and graphical ."
"b1g-fragment02","1452","Of particular interest is the construction of maps showing the expected annual amounts of damage for gridded flood-prone areas ."
"b1g-fragment02","1453","ANUFLOOD also contains modules which permit the investigation of various flood damage mitigation options , such as property height raising , levee construction and flood proofing ."
"b1g-fragment02","1454","Environmental epidemiology"
"b1g-fragment02","1455","The possibilities sketched above relate to emergency planning , the search for hazardous sites , and risk assessment ."
"b1g-fragment02","1456","To what extent can GIS help if an event occurs ?"
"b1g-fragment02","1457","What , for instance , of the health consequences ?"
"b1g-fragment02","1458","There is a rich tradition of epidemiological work in geography and with the increasing availability of spatially referenced medical data the scope for GIS applications is wide ( Gatrell 1987 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1459","For instance , Diggle et al. ( 1990 ) assess the hypothesis that cancer of the larynx is associated with proximity to a now-closed incinerator and develop a statistical model from the theory of spatial point processes to test this ."
"b1g-fragment02","1460","This would have been impossible without the link provided from postcoded data ( increasingly available from sources such as cancer registries ) to Ordnance Survey ( OS ) grid references ."
"b1g-fragment02","1461","Such a link is provided by the Central Postcode Directory , which matches all 1.5 million unit postcodes in the UK to grid references ."
"b1g-fragment02","1462","When the cases of laryngeal cancer are compared with a null distribution ( provided by the distribution of much more common lung cancer ) the hypothesis is given strong support ."
"b1g-fragment02","1463","Although the proposed method is novel , it is but one of an increasingly large number of methods designed to detect and model ‘ clusters ’ of disease ( see , for example , Cuzick and Edwards 1990 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1464","The work of Diggle et al. ( 1990 ) examined only a single point source , though it generalizes to multiple sources and to linear hazards as well ."
"b1g-fragment02","1465","As a second example of health work linked to hazard studies we may cite the research being conducted by Cross ( 1989 ) on childhood leukaemia ."
"b1g-fragment02","1466","There are numerous hypotheses concerning the aetiology of this disease ( from ionizing radiation to viral transmission ) and Cross 's approach is to collect digital data designed to test some of these hypotheses and to use ARC/INFO to display and analyse results ."
"b1g-fragment02","1467","For instance , one hypothesis concerns the role of electromagnetic radiation , a source of which is overhead high-voltage transmission lines as noted earlier ."
"b1g-fragment02","1468","If these are digitized and buffer zones constructed around them ( Fig. 10.3 ) we can quite easily test hypotheses about prevalence in such buffer zones as compared with prevalence outside ."
"b1g-fragment02","1469","However , we should bear in mind the earlier point about the resolution of the data , since such electromagnetic effects have a very weak effect beyond perhaps 50 m ( Wertheimer and Leeper 1982 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1470","There has been a suspicion for many years that high rates of stomach cancer in parts of Wales may be linked to soil chemistry , specifically such factors as zinc/copper ratios , and to lead content in water supplies ."
"b1g-fragment02","1471","Matthews ( 1989 ) has used data from the Regional Cancer Registry ( morbidity rather than mortality data ) and data on trace elements to examine this link ."
"b1g-fragment02","1472","Since the latter are available for a 5 km raster the registration data are assigned to these grid squares using the OS grid reference ."
"b1g-fragment02","1473","As with any such study there are the usual problems of ecological analysis and influences of migration , together with issues of separating out the risk factors under investigation from possible confounding factors ."
"b1g-fragment02","1474","In the USA , Morrill 's report on the beginnings of a $15m. study into the possible radiation doses received as result of radiation releases by the Hanford ( Washington State ) nuclear complex would seem to cry out for GIS skills to be applied ( Morrill 1989 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1475","The research project will employ plume dispersion models in order to model dispersal by wind and will need to integrate this and other environmental data with detailed demographic records ."
"b1g-fragment02","1476","To some extent this line of approach was anticipated by Johnson ( 1981 ) in his study of exposure to plutonium fall-out from the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver ( see Zeigler et al. 1983 : 47–8 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1477","Using soil samples he constructed a contoured risk surface and then mapped excess cancers in various distance bands , detecting a marked distance decay effect ."
"b1g-fragment02","1478","Research problems and prospects"
"b1g-fragment02","1479","The work reviewed above suggests that the application of GIS techniques to hazard assessment , emergency planning and environmental monitoring is both actually and potentially an important research area with many challenging problems ."
"b1g-fragment02","1480","Undoubtedly , the GISs of the 1990s will look very different from their rather primitive ancestors ."
"b1g-fragment02","1481","Computer power is becoming cheaper , digital data more readily available , and GISs are becoming hybrid systems involving other technologies ."
"b1g-fragment02","1482","In this last section we highlight some important research areas as we see them ."
"b1g-fragment02","1483","Doubtless there are many others , such is the surge of interest in GIS technology ."
"b1g-fragment02","1484","Data availability"
"b1g-fragment02","1485","We should first consider_0.061 the availability and quality of data concerning the populations who may be at risk from the storage and transport of hazardous substances , from toxic air pollution , from flooding and so on ."
"b1g-fragment02","1486","Such data are crucial , either for assisting the emergency services to make_-0.353 assessments_0.118 about resources_0.029 they need to deploy_0.182 in such events , or for high-quality_-0.438 estimates to be made_-0.382 of risk ."
"b1g-fragment02","1487","Within the public domain_0.029 in the UK we must rely in general on data from the most recent Population Census , the lowest_-0.129 level_-0.273 being that for enumeration districts ( EDs ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1488","As is well known ( Rhind 1983 ) these contain on average perhaps 150–200 households and 400–500 people ."
"b1g-fragment02","1489","The boundaries_0.333 EDs have not been widely digitized , unlike the higher-level_-0.094 electoral wards ."
"b1g-fragment02","1490","However , the centroids of EDs are available as 100 m grid_-0.206 references and artificial ED ‘ polygons ’ can be created if necessary ."
"b1g-fragment02","1491","In some instances such data will suffice ; in many cases they will have to suffice as nothing better is available ."
"b1g-fragment02","1492","But in some areas EDs are very extensive physical units and the shapes will be quite distorted ."
"b1g-fragment02","1493","Furthermore , the scales_0.167 at which population estimates are often required means that even EDs are too coarse_0.219 for risk assessments_0.353 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1494","For instance , in performing its quantitative risk assessments_0.235 the Health and Safety Executive will rarely deal_-0.235 with distances from hazardous sites in excess of 1 km ( Petts 1988 ) and census data will not offer_-0.229 sufficient resolution_0.273 for accurate_0 population estimates to be made_-0.176 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1495","It should be pointed_0.031 out , however , that the National Radiological Protection Board currently uses_-0.455 1 km grid_0.121 square resolution population data from the 1971 Census in its radiological protection studies ( Hallam et al. 1981 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1496","It would seem that , despite the costs involved , they should consider_-0.412 investing in the very detailed digital data ( Pinpoint Address Code ( PAC ) ) provided by Pinpoint Analysis Ltd ."
"b1g-fragment02","1497","This area_-0.375 of application_0.125 would appear to be an obvious market_0.171 for such a product ."
"b1g-fragment02","1498","A useful research exercise_0.242 would be to compare the use of census and PAC data in deriving_0.364 quantitative risk assessments_0.206 and this is an interesting research problem ."
"b1g-fragment02","1499","Even with PAC data some assumptions_0.303 would need to be made_-0.147 about numbers of persons per household if good population estimates were to be made_-0.229 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1500","More generally , we need to consider_-0.091 the availability of large_-0.382 databases for hazard studies and emergency planning_-0.182 and this is an area_-0.206 ripe_0.194 for major initiatives ."
"b1g-fragment02","1501","In the UK we seem to be lagging_0.424 well behind the USA in the construction_0.324 of databases on hazardous sites and especially hazard events such as those involving toxic releases_0.364 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1502","For instance , Lioy and Daisey ( 1987 ) , in their work on the monitoring of toxic air pollution in New Jersey , construct_0.114 what they term_-0.212 a ‘ microinventory_0.229 ’ for each of three towns , comprising the locations of chemical plants_0.03 , metal processing plants_0.094 , paint spray manufacturers and so on ."
"b1g-fragment02","1503","Some attribute information is available for these ."
"b1g-fragment02","1504","More closely_-0.091 linked_-0.03 to GIS is work by McMaster and Johnson ( 1986 ) who perform a very detailed inventory_0.156 of hazardous materials ( both stored and transported ) in Santa Monica , California ."
"b1g-fragment02","1505","Although the raster displays_0.219 are very crude_0.171 it is simple to answer spatial queries concerning the locations of people ( for instance , particular age groups ) within certain distances of toxic hazard sites ."
"b1g-fragment02","1506","We have data on some hazardous sites ( e.g. those regulated_0.176 by CIMAH ) in the UK but a much more comprehensive approach_-0.029 should be adopted_0.353 , especially if we are serious in the search_-0.088 for environmental associations_0.219 with chronic diseases ."
"b1g-fragment02","1507","The same is true for toxic releases_0.194 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1508","In the USA the Environmental Protection Agency produces_-0.088 an Acute Hazards Events Database while the Department of Transportation has a database recording_0 details of 25 000 releases_0.147 of toxic materials ; such details include_-0.25 locational information , type and amount of material released_0.156 , mode of release_-0.029 and resulting injuries or deaths ( Cutter and Solecki 1989 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1509","Can we not use GIS technology to construct_-0.059 ‘ risk mosaics_0.375 ’ ( Zeigler et al. 1983 ) , at a variety of spatial scales_0.375 , akin to Hewitt and Burton 's ‘ hazardousness ’ of a place ?"
"b1g-fragment02","1510","In the UK only a handful_0.182 of county emergency planning_0.156 departments ( Cumbria , for instance ) have built_-0.118 up resource_-0.094 databases in digital form_-0.156 and this needs to be promoted ."
"b1g-fragment02","1511","Further_0.147 afield_0.515 , we need to recognize_0.121 that some disasters ( most obviously Chernobyl ) will have implications for more than one country so that environmental monitoring should take_-0.533 place_-0.097 with some kind of international co-ordination_0.029 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1512","There will also be movements of hazardous cargoes across frontiers and there are clearly problems of risk assessment_0.182 and planning_-0.088 for emergencies at or near international boundaries , or at sea and airports ."
"b1g-fragment02","1513","As noted above_-0.156 , the work of Fedra ( 1989 ) is a major step_-0.242 in this direction_0.062 , and links_0.059 need to be forged_0.312 between initiatives in the UK and the rest of Europe ."
"b1g-fragment02","1514","In terms of databases on hazardous wastes , attention has already been drawn_0.333 to the waste disposal plans_-0.588 prepared_-0.028 by WRAs ."
"b1g-fragment02","1515","These give_-0.281 details of present site locations and some indication of permitted wastes , though little or no information on closed_-0.188 and abandoned sites ."
"b1g-fragment02","1516","However , for details of disposal the individual site licences must be consulted_0.226 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1517","The former Hazardous Waste Inspectorate operated_-0.057 a large_-0.188 database on all sites , with details of permitted wastes , including allowable quantities ."
"b1g-fragment02","1518","The database was created by a commercial company , Aspinwalls Ltd ."
"b1g-fragment02","1519","There are numerous potentially usable databases for environmental epidemiological work ."
"b1g-fragment02","1520","OPCS , of course , is a major data repository_0.182 for medical statistics and their various Monitor Series are of use , though only at the scale_0.2 of district health authority and above_0 ( see Gatrell and Lovett 1988 for an example ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1521","Regional health authorities will from time to time produce_0 mortality data at ward level_0.212 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1522","However , if cancers are of interest it is more appropriate to obtain_-0.118 data from regional cancer registries ; these data are morbidity rather than mortality data and are therefore more valuable_-0.258 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1523","The data are postcoded and may have some occupational details ."
"b1g-fragment02","1524","For example , we have received data from the Regional Cancer Registry in Manchester comprising all cancers of the larynx and lung notified between 1974 and 1984 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1525","This large_-0.147 data set_0 , to which grid_0.333 references have now been added , comprises information about nearly 40 000 individuals ."
"b1g-fragment02","1526","It has now been copied_-0.094 into INGRES , a relational database management system_-0.206 , permitting_0.147 queries to be made_-0.226 about subsets_0.206 of the data ; for instance , all males between the ages of 25 and 64 suffering from laryngeal cancer ."
"b1g-fragment02","1527","Other data sources_-0.206 on cancers are independent registries of malignancies ."
"b1g-fragment02","1528","An example is that on leukaemias , managed by the Leukaemia Research Fund Centre_-0.03 in Leeds ( Alexander et al. 1989 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1529","It should be noted_-0.455 that there are frequently major discrepancies between the regional registries and the specialist registries , partly because the latter receive_-0.03 notifications directly_0.129 from consultants ."
"b1g-fragment02","1530","Indeed , working directly_0.059 with consultants proves invaluable in gaining_0.029 access_-0.133 to high-quality_0.057 morbidity data ."
"b1g-fragment02","1531","Two other potential sources_0 of data are worth mentioning_0 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1532","First , attention should be drawn_-0.088 to the new directive from the Department of Health to regional and district health authorities to review the health of the population ."
"b1g-fragment02","1533","This means in practice that district medical officers are charged_0.059 with preparing an annual report , presenting_-0.206 and interpreting epidemiological data , identifying local health problems and evaluating service outcomes ."
"b1g-fragment02","1534","Lancaster University is already heavily_0.281 involved in the work of Preston District Health Authority in this area ."
"b1g-fragment02","1535","Second , family health service authorities ( FHSAs ) , are also required to take_-0.176 on these roles_-0.171 , but from the viewpoint_0.188 of primary health care services ."
"b1g-fragment02","1536","FHSAs ( which correspond to non-metropolitan counties and to metropolitan boroughs ) hold_-0.226 large_-0.062 databases on services provided by general practitioners ; for instance , uptake of immunization and screening for breast and cervical cancers ."
"b1g-fragment02","1537","Is it , we wonder , possible to contemplate_0.485 bringing together some of these data sources_-0.029 to form_-0.182 a National Online Health Information System_0.091 ( NOHIS ) , to parallel_0.265 that for employment and unemployment ( Townsend et al. 1987 ) ?"
"b1g-fragment02","1538","This might include_-0.412 data on morbidity and mortality , uptake of preventative medicine , service use and availability , at both primary and hospital level_-0.265 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1539","It would be a useful management tool_0.03 , particularly in view of the reorganization taking_-0.344 place_-0.286 in the National Health Service ."
"b1g-fragment02","1540","It should not be forgotten that hazards themselves have geographical distributions yet there has been little effort in the UK to develop public domain_0.176 databases ."
"b1g-fragment02","1541","Are there hazard-prone_0.324 areas ?"
"b1g-fragment02","1542","Is there a regional differentiation in hazard type ?"
"b1g-fragment02","1543","These are , of course , commercially important questions_-0.1 and a good deal_-0.182 of money is going_-0.441 into the collection_0.097 of such data by insurance companies ."
"b1g-fragment02","1544","One well known database is Major Hazard Incident Data Service ( MHIDAS ) global industrial hazards database which is currently being developed by the Safety and Reliability Directorate on behalf of the Major Hazards Assessment_0.273 Unit of the UK Health and Safety Directorate ."
"b1g-fragment02","1545","This system_-0.121 currently runs_-0.206 in dBASE II and contains_-0.353 in excess of 3000 items_-0.176 of professionally assessed_0.121 information on major hazards coded into some 24 separate fields_0.206 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1546","Unfortunately , the spatial referencing is poor_-0.029 and with some effort this could easily be remedied ."
"b1g-fragment02","1547","It is , for example , little use when recording a chemical spill into an Egyptian river to have entered_-0.171 into the appropriate field_-0.062 ‘ the Nile ’ — after all , this river is some 6480 km long !"
"b1g-fragment02","1548","Here_-0.452 , in our view_-0.147 , is a classic case of the absence of a geographical input_0.091 rendering_0.438 the data of limited value_-0.194 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1549","In some cases , good hazard data exist but have simply not yet found_-0.394 their way_-0.31 into a GIS ."
"b1g-fragment02","1550","A case in point_-0.286 is inland and coastal flooding ."
"b1g-fragment02","1551","Most river authorities have detailed maps showing_0 the geographical limits of floods in relation to their return_-0.086 periods ."
"b1g-fragment02","1552","Within the next decade , as the privatized water companies develop their GIS , we shall see a massive_-0.286 amount of data conversion in this area_-0.485 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1553","This development , together with the availability of digital terrain models_0.03 , will allow_-0.188 quite sophisticated_0.242 flood forecasting models_0 to be developed within a GIS framework_-0.031 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1554","As sea-levels rise in the next 20–30 years due to the ‘ greenhouse ’ effect , this very practical use of GIS technology is likely to become commonplace and of considerable practical importance ."
"b1g-fragment02","1555","Spatial statistics"
"b1g-fragment02","1556","Another way_-0.406 in which there needs to be a rapprochement_0.303 between statistical methods and GIS is in the area_-0.394 of spatial sampling_0.344 and estimation from spatial samples_-0.2 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1557","This is clearly an important issue in radiation monitoring as the discussion_0.212 of RIMNET above_-0.412 implies_0.176 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1558","As an example , Peirson ( 1988 ) has reviewed the evidence on artificial radioactivity in Cumbria and shows maps of the distribution of certain radionuclides as contoured surfaces ."
"b1g-fragment02","1559","The point_-0.324 worth making_-0.353 here_-0.387 is that there are many alternative schemes for interpolating from irregular point_-0.118 data ( Lam 1983 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1560","One method in particular , kriging ( now available as part_-0.2 of the UNIRAS software ) , offers_-0.083 not only a contoured surface but also an estimate of the standard error at any point on the map ."
"b1g-fragment02","1561","Where this is high_-0.212 it suggests_-0.206 that an additional sampling_0.2 station might be set up ."
"b1g-fragment02","1562","Such techniques are now standard in environmental science ( see Streit 1981 for an application_0.273 to rainfall monitoring ) and need to be promoted vigorously_0.118 in hazard studies ( Estes et al. 1987 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1563","Related_0.029 to this problem is that of making_-0.114 population estimates for new zones that result from overlay_0.294 operations_0.097 ."
"b1g-fragment02","1564","We may want to count numbers living within plumes_0.484 , circles of fixed_-0.061 radius , buffer zones and so on ."
"b1g-fragment02","1565","Existing GIS techniques usually base_0.03 the estimates on area-weighted shares_0 , so that a new polygon created by ‘ slicing_0.469 ’ an existing area in half is assigned_-0.031 half the population of that source_0.118 unit ."
"b1g-fragment02","1566","This may be quite absurd in some cases , notably where population is spatially clustered within a physically large ED ."
"b1g-fragment02","1567","At the NWRRL work is under way ( Flowerdew and Green 1989 ) to solve such problems using the EM algorithm and the statistical modelling_0.333 package_0.029 GLIM , which has been interfaced_0.364 with ARC/INFO ."
"b1g-fragment02","1568","Operations_0.143 research methods and simulation"
"b1g-fragment02","1569","While there is some research activity in linking_-0.031 statistical models_0.069 to GIS there would seem to be scope for further applications_-0.062 of operations_0.091 research techniques to GIS problems ."
"b1g-fragment02","1570","Within some sophisticated_0.294 GIS such as ARC/INFO there are some useful algorithms ( such as shortest_0.086 path_0.065 calculations ) , but GIS developers have in general failed_-0.118 to realize the natural links_0.235 between GIS functions and many operations_0.194 research techniques ."
"b1g-fragment02","1571","Over the last 20 years or so a large_-0.471 theoretical literature has been developed to provide tools_-0.061 for the solution_0.206 of many problems associated with emergency planning_-0.091 ( Kolesar 1981 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1572","One important class of problems is the selection of locations for the emergency service units ."
"b1g-fragment02","1573","The choice of locations need not be for permanent bases , but can also include_-0.147 dynamic repositioning of units as circumstances dictate_0.059 ( Kolesar and Walker 1974 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1574","In any major emergency a typical problem is the assignment_0.156 of resources_0.088 to demands ."
"b1g-fragment02","1575","If resources_0.125 are held_-0.182 at one set of locations and the demands are at another and the costs of transportation are known , how do we allocate the resources_-0.091 most efficiently ?"
"b1g-fragment02","1576","In a major emergency , for example , there might be a need to supply blood products held_-0.059 at regional blood banks to hospitals ."
"b1g-fragment02","1577","This , of course , is the classic transportation problem and its solution_0.273 is well known ."
"b1g-fragment02","1578","As far_-0.294 as we know the microcomputer-based_-0.091 emergency response_0.088 system_0.062 devised by Belardo et al. ( 1983 ) , is the only GIS-like software to incorporate this algorithm ."
"b1g-fragment02","1579","In this system_-0.088 , the solution_-0.171 to the transportation problem is shown graphically on the road network , which is displayed on the computer screen ."
"b1g-fragment02","1580","As a last example of the potential role_-0.094 of operations_0.03 research in GIS and disaster management we are reminded of the logistic problems that faced_0.061 the Peel Regional Police Force during the Mississauga evacuation mentioned_0.03 previously ( Scanlon and Padgham 1980 ) ."
"b1g-fragment02","1581","During the early states_0.094 of the phased evacuation the logistical problem facing_0 the police was the street-by-street warning of the population to make_-0.118 ready for evacuation ."
"b1g-fragment02","1582","Speed was of the essence_0.062 and manpower was limited ."
"b1g-fragment02","1583","Here_-0.152 , then , is a familiar operations_0.125 research network_0.188 problem : all roads have to be traversed such that the journey length/time is a minimum ."
"b1g-fragment02","1584","This is the so-called_0.061 Chinese_0.278 postman_0.559 problem_-0.469 , which provides a Hamiltonian circuit through the arcs ( as compared with the travelling_-0.121 salesman_0.294 problem_-0.061 which is a minimum route_0.059 through the network_0.375 nodes_-0.065 ) ."
"bmw-fragment09","2543","CHAPTER NINE"
"bmw-fragment09","2544","‘ I have a very important assignment for you , Paula , ’ Arlene Frampton-Cox said ."
"bmw-fragment09","2545","She inserted a Du Maurier cigarette into her long tortoiseshell holder and sat back , looking at Paula , who was seated in the visitor 's chair on the other side of the desk , long legs crossed elegantly ."
"bmw-fragment09","2546","Paula looked every inch a model_0 these days , Arlene thought with a touch_-0.273 of proprietorial_0.576 pride ."
"bmw-fragment09","2547","Her long hair , shining_0.229 gold_-0.088 , was swept back and caught_0.061 at the nape of her neck with a bow_0.029 , make-up_0.088 , expertly applied , accentuated the classically beautiful lines_0.206 of her face , and she wore her well-cut suit with all the panache that was expected of her ."
"bmw-fragment09","2548","A good suit was a working model_-0.091 's uniform_0.353 — Paula now bought two each season and wore them with perfectly matching accessories , hat , bag and shoes ."
"bmw-fragment09","2549","This one was in soft_-0.088 light_-0.324 green with a boxy_0.29 shaped_-0.118 jacket and narrow skirt and the same green-and-white check material of the little sleeveless blouse had been used to line_-0.027 the jacket and face_0.03 the wide reveres ."
"bmw-fragment09","2550","Paula 's bag and shoes were patent black leather , her gloves white , and she carried a long walking umbrella neatly furled in its fur-trimmed case ."
"bmw-fragment09","2551","Perfectly groomed_0.206 from head to toe and with all that assurance , she was ready to take on the world_-0.118 , Arlene thought with satisfaction , for she looked_-0.242 on Paula as her very own creation_0.118 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2552","The raw_-0.176 materials_0.029 might have been there before_-0.2 — indeed , had n't it been she , Arlene , who had spotted_0.059 them ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2553","But the transformation of a leggy young filly_0.206 into a sleekly beautiful racehorse_0.452 had been her doing ."
"bmw-fragment09","2554","eighteen months on the model_0.143 circuit_0.636 had eliminated_0.258 all trace_0.029 of her former Somerset accent ."
"bmw-fragment09","2555","She had listened to Arlene 's own voice and set about imitating_0.212 it for she held_-0.364 her mentor in the highest_-0.121 esteem whilst still being a little afraid of her ."
"bmw-fragment09","2556","The House of Mattli is expanding_0.091 from couture into ready-to-wear and one of the big_-0.469 Bristol stores , Taylors , are putting_0.029 on a show to publicise the fact that they will be stocking the new prêt-è-porter ' , Arlene explained ."
"bmw-fragment09","2557","‘ I have been asked to supply_-0.206 the models_0.029 and I would like you to be one of them . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2558","‘ Mattli ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2559","Paula repeated , impressed ."
"bmw-fragment09","2560","The House of Mattli was a husband and wife team who were numbered amongst the top_-0.265 ten names in the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers ."
"bmw-fragment09","2561","Furthermore Madame Mattli was a Frenchwoman , an accident of birth which added to her glamour , for was not Paris the fashion capital_0.125 of the world ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2562","‘ Madame Mattli will be coming to Bristol herself , ’ Arlene continued ."
"bmw-fragment09","2563","‘ Taylors have a certain amount of stock but she will be bringing extra samples from London especially for the show ."
"bmw-fragment09","2564","I only want the best of my girls on this job ."
"bmw-fragment09","2565","Madame Mattli , remember , is used to the best ."
"bmw-fragment09","2566","We ca n't afford_-0.206 any sloppiness ."
"bmw-fragment09","2567","I can count on you , Paula , I feel_-0.257 sure . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2568","‘ Oh yes , ’ Paula said , brimming_0 with suppressed_0.091 excitement ."
"bmw-fragment09","2569","‘ You can count on me ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2570","Madame Mattli was almost exactly as Paula had imagined she would be , a petite perfectly turned out woman with an air_0.441 of chic that was unmistakably French ."
"bmw-fragment09","2571","Her dark_-0.152 , grey-streaked_0.529 hair , which she wore in a long bob , had been cut by Vidal Sassoon and she wore a beautifully tailored black suit relieved_0.156 only by a little white flounce at the neckline ."
"bmw-fragment09","2572","In the fitting rooms at Taylors she fussed and fretted over her creations_0.152 like a mother_-0.121 hen_0.242 and though Paula was overawed by the great designer she also liked her on sight ."
"bmw-fragment09","2573","Madame Mattli might be a stickler for detail , with a generous_0.065 helping_0.094 of the artistic temperament which kept her tight-coiled_0.514 as a spring_-0.065 and which would explode_0.242 into frenzy if the smallest detail was not as it should be , but she also had a kind_-0.469 face and deep_-0.029 perceptive_-0.059 eyes ."
"bmw-fragment09","2574","Half way through the day 's programme of shows , while the dressers went off to grab a sandwich and the model girls , who would not dare to eat while they were showing , revived_0.273 themselves with cups of black coffee , Madame Mattli took Paula to one side ."
"bmw-fragment09","2575","‘ Little one , I would like to speak with you . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2576","Paula 's stomach turned_0.121 a somersault_0.412 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2577","Had she done something wrong ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2578","‘ I have been watching you work , ’ Madame Mattli said directly_-0.176 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2579","Her accent reminded Paula of Louise — perhaps that was why she warmed_0.03 to her in spite of the fact that she was so awe-inspiring ."
"bmw-fragment09","2580","‘ You are exactly right for a couture model_0.03 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2581","You have all the physical attributes . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2582","‘ Thank you , ’ Paula said faintly ."
"bmw-fragment09","2583","Madame Mattli waved a dismissive_0.294 hand ."
"bmw-fragment09","2584","‘ Do not thank me ."
"bmw-fragment09","2585","I am not saying this to make_-0.4 your head swell_0.125 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2586","On the contrary ."
"bmw-fragment09","2587","The fact is that I have a vacancy arising_0.375 for a couture model_-0.265 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2588","I believe you are exactly what I am looking_-0.529 for ."
"bmw-fragment09","2589","I would like you to come to London to work for me . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2590","Over Madame Mattli 's shoulder Paula could see Arlene watching her , a tiny smile lifting_0 one corner_0.029 of her scarlet mouth , and Paula knew her well enough by now to know exactly what she was thinking ."
"bmw-fragment09","2591","She did not want to lose_-0.25 Paula , who was one of her best models_-0.303 , but already she was enjoying the reflected_0.281 glory_0.355 that came_-0.514 from having personally trained a house model_-0.114 for one of the great London couture houses ."
"bmw-fragment09","2592","She had known about the vacancy at Mattli and hoped that the job might be offered to Paula ."
"bmw-fragment09","2593","It was the seal_0.029 of approval for her own judgement ."
"bmw-fragment09","2594","‘ Well ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2595","Madame Mattli demanded ."
"bmw-fragment09","2596","‘ Can I have a little time to think it over ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2597","Paula asked boldly ."
"bmw-fragment09","2598","‘ A little ."
"bmw-fragment09","2599","But please do not delay too long ."
"bmw-fragment09","2600","My present_-0.286 house model_0.147 leaves at the end_-0.529 of the month and there are plenty of girls who would jump_-0.125 at the chance . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2601","‘ I 'm sure ."
"bmw-fragment09","2602","But all the same I could n't make_-0.452 such a move_-0.094 without giving_-0.394 it some thought , ’ Paula said grandly ."
"bmw-fragment09","2603","But inside she was bubbling_0.382 with excitement ."
"bmw-fragment09","2604","Time to think ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2605","She did n't need a single second ."
"bmw-fragment09","2606","The moment Madame Mattli had offered her the job she had made_-0.353 up her mind ."
"bmw-fragment09","2607","She was going to take_-0.235 it — of course !"
"bmw-fragment09","2608","A month later Paula , smartly dressed in a new tweed suit with the obligatory matching bag and shoes , and lugging both her modelling_0 case and a brand new cream leather suitcase , took_-0.029 the train to London to begin her new career ."
"bmw-fragment09","2609","She had booked herself a bed at a YWCA hostel for the time being ."
"bmw-fragment09","2610","It was not quite what she envisaged for herself but it had the advantage of being cheap and it went_-0.314 some way_-0.171 towards satisfying Grace , who was convinced that London was a den_0.273 of iniquity waiting_-0.125 to swallow up her unsuspecting daughter ."
"bmw-fragment09","2611","From the hostel it was only a short tube ride to South Audley Street where Madame Mattli had her showrooms — yet another advantage , Paula thought , trying to weigh up the points_-0.057 in favour of the hostel , which she hated on sight ."
"bmw-fragment09","2612","Sharing a small spartan room with two other girls — Northerners whose accent Paula found_-0.314 almost incomprehensible and with whom she had nothing in common , making breakfast in the communal kitchen , queuing for the bath , adhering_0.353 to a strict_-0.212 curfew after which time the doors were locked and bolted — none of these were restrictions Paula had the slightest_0.545 intention of enduring for long ."
"bmw-fragment09","2613","But for now it would have to do ."
"bmw-fragment09","2614","And at least she was in London , centre_0.176 of the British fashion industry_0.057 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2615","As for the House of Mattli , it might have been in a different world_0.088 to the hostel , with its air_0.088 of being a cross_0.086 between a workhouse_0.257 and a boarding_-0.061 school_-0.2 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2616","The first time she rang the bell and went in through the front doors of the elegant old house where the showrooms were situated ( Mattli had no rear entrance ) Paula felt she was stepping into the place of her dreams_0 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2617","Deep_0.2 carpet covered the floors and the stairs swept_0.206 up to the showrooms and the warren_0.324 of workrooms beyond , and though the window drapes and furnishings were ever-so-slightly faded_0.114 , as if they had seen_-0.152 better days , they were of the finest silks and velvets and every corner was swept , polished and cleaned daily so that no single speck of dust , let alone a cobweb , dared_0.143 show_-0.469 itself ."
"bmw-fragment09","2618","The showroom was neither large nor small , decorated in muted shades_0.182 of aubergine which would not detract from the clothes ."
"bmw-fragment09","2619","There was a low table and three or four dainty chairs with aubergine velvet seats and gilded spindle legs_-0.156 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2620","The crystal chandelier was for effect only — lighting that would show off the clothes to their best advantage was brilliant yet discreet_0.312 , and along one wall were racks holding some of the ready-to-wear garments ."
"bmw-fragment09","2621","In contrast to this elegant frontage the workrooms beyond were a hive_0.5 of frenzied activity ."
"bmw-fragment09","2622","Pattern cutters , fitters , sewing hands and their assistants all worked at an incredible speed ."
"bmw-fragment09","2623","This , Paula soon discovered_-0.147 , was the way_-0.059 of the fashion world_0.059 — a constant_-0.031 frantic rush against the clock , to have collections ready_-0.406 on time or to complete individual couture garments for customers who always considered their order_-0.118 more urgent , more important , than that of anyone else ."
"bmw-fragment09","2624","Paula was amazed by the security arrangements that were necessary to ensure that the new season 's collections remained exclusive — the windows at the rear of the premises were heavily barred and practically the first thing_-0.265 she had to do on commencing her employment_-0.118 was to sign a contract promising that she would not breathe_0.382 a word about the designs she saw ."
"bmw-fragment09","2625","On her second day Madame Mattli took her to Vidal Sassoon 's salon in Grosvenor House so that her hair could be cut in an up-to-the-minute style ."
"bmw-fragment09","2626","Unlike some couturiers Madame did not mind if her model_-0.206 girls did not have the same colour hair but she did insist on identical styles ."
"bmw-fragment09","2627","By the time Vidal Sassoon had finished with her Paula 's long fair_0.156 locks had been shorn to a sharp_0.219 geometric shape and she scarcely recognised the reflection that looked_-0.303 back at her from the mirror ."
"bmw-fragment09","2628","Among the rich and famous who had come to the salon to have their hair cut , tinted and set , Paula recognised Dusty Springfield , the pop singer , her eyes big and sooty_0.471 , her lips pearly pink , and was unable to suppress_0.375 the thrill of excitement which ran_0.061 through her ."
"bmw-fragment09","2629","This was her very first taste_-0.029 of only the best being good enough — and she liked it !"
"bmw-fragment09","2630","It was Paula 's job to show samples , parading slowly up and down in front of the clients as they sat on the elegant spindle-leg chairs taking_-0.273 in every detail of the garments with a critical_-0.094 and practised_0.471 eye ."
"bmw-fragment09","2631","Sometimes they came alone , sometimes with a man in tow_0.125 — to foot_0.212 the bill_-0.176 !"
"bmw-fragment09","2632","Paula guessed ."
"bmw-fragment09","2633","The appearance of a famous face in the show rooms always caused a stir_-0.059 amongst the girls , who all longed to hook_0.125 a wealthy husband — and if he had a title , like the Aly Khan , or was a film star like Omar Shariff , then so much the better !"
"bmw-fragment09","2634","Not everything that Paula had to do was quite so glamorous , however ."
"bmw-fragment09","2635","In the long_-0.229 hours when there were no customers to show she was expected to lend_-0.059 a hand_-0.419 with some of the unskilled tasks — running_-0.176 errands and making tea , unpicking a seam or a hem , even sewing on a button or a hook and eye when she had been taught the proper way_-0.294 to do it ."
"bmw-fragment09","2636","Paula was not very clever with her needle but she soon learned to be careful so as not to incur the wrath of the seamstress ."
"bmw-fragment09","2637","There were new tricks of modelling_0.031 to be learned too — how to remove a coat , sliding It carefully off her shoulders with the sleeves hanging in perfect balance , never for one moment allowing the inside to be on view , for samples were often unlined ."
"bmw-fragment09","2638","This trick_-0.118 took_-0.419 hours of practice , up and down the landing at the hostel while the other girls looked at her as if she had taken_-0.091 leave_-0.029 of her senses_0.118 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2639","Although she enjoyed her job Paula was lonely ."
"bmw-fragment09","2640","Even the most popular of girls soon discovered that in this highly competitive world_-0.118 where models_0.276 vied with one another for the most glamorous jobs and the wealthiest and best-looking men there was far more bitchiness than in the provinces — and Paula was far from popular ."
"bmw-fragment09","2641","The other girls disliked her for her outstanding looks and her haughty ways_-0.206 and made_-0.324 no attempt to be friendly on anything but the most superficial level_-0.029 and the pattern cutters and sewing hands hurried home to their families and boyfriends the moment they finished their long_-0.485 day 's work ."
"bmw-fragment09","2642","Paula spent_-0.125 most of her free_-0.412 time alone , window shopping , visiting News Theatres , where she sometimes watched the programme of cartoons twice round_-0.265 , and drinking endless cups of Espresso coffee in cafés and coffee houses ."
"bmw-fragment09","2643","Her favourite was the coffee shop in Fenwicks in Bond Street for this was the haunt and the meeting place of all those from the world_-0.161 of fashion ."
"bmw-fragment09","2644","One lunchtime when she had been at the House of Mattli for a few months Paula went there for her usual coffee and the cottage cheese salad that was her staple diet now that it was so important that she did not add a single half-inch to her wand-slim_0 figure ."
"bmw-fragment09","2645","She took her tray to the pay desk , opened her bag and felt for her purse ."
"bmw-fragment09","2646","It was not there ."
"bmw-fragment09","2647","Frantically she rooted_0.061 round , then checked her pockets without success ."
"bmw-fragment09","2648","‘ I 'm sorry ."
"bmw-fragment09","2649","I seem to have lost my purse … ’ she explained ."
"bmw-fragment09","2650","The girl behind the till stared at her stonily ."
"bmw-fragment09","2651","Paula was going hot and cold by now ."
"bmw-fragment09","2652","Had it been stolen ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2653","No , she remembered her bag tipping over in the cloakroom at Mattli — it must have fallen out then ."
"bmw-fragment09","2654","But without it she could not pay for her coffee and salad ."
"bmw-fragment09","2655","‘ Having trouble ? ’ a voice beside her asked_-0.429 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2656","‘ Do n't worry_-0.485 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2657","Let me . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2658","Paula turned gratefully , then gasped with surprise as she recognised the slight figure in black roll-neck sweater and skin tight pants ."
"bmw-fragment09","2659","‘ I do n't believe it !"
"bmw-fragment09","2660","Gary Oliver !"
"bmw-fragment09","2661","What are you doing here ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2662","‘ The same as you I expect , Paula — getting_-0.257 my strength up to face_0 the rest of the day ."
"bmw-fragment09","2663","Let me pay and then we 'll have lunch together and do some catching_-0.147 up — unless you 're meeting someone , of course . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2664","‘ No — no , I 'm not . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2665","Paula picked up her try and moved aside waiting for him , flushed with pleasure at seeing a familiar face ."
"bmw-fragment09","2666","Gary Oliver was a designer , young and very talented ."
"bmw-fragment09","2667","She had met him back home_-0.125 in the west country when he had come to supervise a show put_-0.067 on by one of the big_-0.171 ready-to-wear labels , Carnega , for whom he worked as a junior_0.226 member_-0.03 of the design_-0.206 team ."
"bmw-fragment09","2668","For a whole_-0.121 week they had worked closely_0.062 together , sharing flasks of coffee and packets of cigarettes and Paula had grown_0.061 to like the pixieish_0.364 little man who by his very nature_0.121 offered_0.057 her no challenge_0.294 — and no threat_-0.086 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2669","Gary should have been a girl , she had thought , for he was half a head smaller than she was with fair_0.233 curling hair , baby-blue eyes and long thick lashes that were the envy of every woman who met him ."
"bmw-fragment09","2670","‘ Shall we sit over there in the corner ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2671","Gary suggested ."
"bmw-fragment09","2672","He led the way , his slim hips in the tight fitting pants snaking gracefully between the tables ."
"bmw-fragment09","2673","They unloaded_0.097 their trays on to a table ."
"bmw-fragment09","2674","‘ What are you doing in London then , Paula ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2675","Apart from mislaying your purse , I mean . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2676","He grinned at her impishly ."
"bmw-fragment09","2677","She told him ."
"bmw-fragment09","2678","‘ And what about you ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2679","Are n't you with Carnega any more ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2680","He shook his head ."
"bmw-fragment09","2681","Dimples played_0.143 in his cheeks ."
"bmw-fragment09","2682","‘ No — now I 'm with the House of Oliver . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2683","‘ The House of Oliver … ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2684","Oh ! ’ she squealed as light_-0.03 dawned_0.129 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2685","‘ Your own house ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2686","You 've set_-0.618 up as a designer in your own right_0.059 , Gary ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2687","‘ Yep ."
"bmw-fragment09","2688","In a small_-0.057 way_-0.576 at the moment , of course , but things_-0.303 are happening ."
"bmw-fragment09","2689","I came_-0.375 into a bit_-0.5 of money when my grandmother died and I decided to put_-0.375 it to good use . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2690","‘ Is n't it a bit_-0.2 of a risk ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2691","Paula asked ."
"bmw-fragment09","2692","He shrugged his narrow shoulders ."
"bmw-fragment09","2693","‘ Perhaps ."
"bmw-fragment09","2694","But I wanted to work for myself ."
"bmw-fragment09","2695","Designing clothes for Carnega was all very well and I made_-0.219 a good living at it I wo n't deny but I wanted to be free to do my own thing_-0.394 — and to have my own name on the labels ."
"bmw-fragment09","2696","I have quite a few contacts_-0.03 — people who knew me when I was designing for Carnega — and they have been very encouraging ."
"bmw-fragment09","2697","So I have decided to move to London and open_-0.667 a showroom ."
"bmw-fragment09","2698","In fact I have just been looking at a place in South Audley Street , not far from Mattli ."
"bmw-fragment09","2699","If it works out we shall practically_0.188 be neighbours , Paula . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2700","‘ What a small world !"
"bmw-fragment09","2701","I had no idea , ’ Paula said , surprised she had not already heard the news ."
"bmw-fragment09","2702","Usually the slightest_-0.235 whisper travelled_0.333 like jungle_0.303 drums_0.294 through the world_-0.176 of fashion ."
"bmw-fragment09","2703","Until now Gary had been an out-of-town designer , of course ."
"bmw-fragment09","2704","But if he was moving_-0.235 to London his new fashion house would soon be a talking point ."
"bmw-fragment09","2705","‘ We must keep_-0.382 in touch_0.176 , ’ Gary said as he finished his cheese roll ."
"bmw-fragment09","2706","‘ Promise you 'll look in and say hello when you have time . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2707","‘ I will ."
"bmw-fragment09","2708","Apart from anything else I owe_-0.088 you a coffee . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2709","‘ True ."
"bmw-fragment09","2710","I do n't suppose I could persuade you to work for me in return_0 ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2711","I 'm looking_-0.118 for a couple of good models_-0.065 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2712","Though I do n't suppose I could afford to pay you as well as Mattli does — yet ."
"bmw-fragment09","2713","Maybe one day … ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2714","Paula laughed ."
"bmw-fragment09","2715","‘ I do n't earn that_-0.455 much !"
"bmw-fragment09","2716","By the time I 've paid for my room at the YWCA and bought all the make-up and clothes I need there never seems to be anything left over ."
"bmw-fragment09","2717","I 'm looking_-0.281 for a rich husband to take_-0.529 me away from it all . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2718","‘ And I 'm sure one day you 'll find him ."
"bmw-fragment09","2719","In the meantime , do n't forget your friends , eh Paula ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2720","‘ I wo n't , ’ she promised , glancing at her watch ."
"bmw-fragment09","2721","‘ Oh hell_0.176 , I shall have to go . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2722","‘ Me too ."
"bmw-fragment09","2723","But it was great_-0.364 to see you again , Paula . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2724","They walked back to South Audley Street together , weaving_0.147 their way through the lunchtime crowds on the pavements , the tall , striking girl and the young man whose pixieish_0.430 looks_-0.067 belied his twenty-six years ."
"bmw-fragment09","2725","Outside the front entrance of the House of Mattli Paula turned to give_-0.412 him a quick_-0.235 impulsive hug ."
"bmw-fragment09","2726","‘ Thanks for the lunch , Gary ."
"bmw-fragment09","2727","And good luck with your new venture ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2728","She held up her fingers , tightly_0.29 crossed for him ."
"bmw-fragment09","2729","He grinned ."
"bmw-fragment09","2730","‘ I 'll need it ."
"bmw-fragment09","2731","Do n't forget to come and see me , will you ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2732","I shall be expecting you . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2733","‘ I wo n't forget ."
"bmw-fragment09","2734","'Bye for now ! ’ she called , and ran in through the imposing front door ."
"bmw-fragment09","2735","Madame Mattli was furious ."
"bmw-fragment09","2736","In all the time she had been with her Paula had never seen her so angry ."
"bmw-fragment09","2737","‘ I hear you have been seen going into the House of Oliver , ’ she said , her immaculately_0.344 painted_0.424 lips tight_-0.118 with fury ."
"bmw-fragment09","2738","Beside her Monsieur Mattli , a small Greek-looking man , some ten years her senior , was also quivering with indignation ."
"bmw-fragment09","2739","‘ Not once but several times , ’ he added_-0.324 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2740","It was so unusual for him to contribute_-0.094 anything to the conversation that Paula glanced at him in surprise ."
"bmw-fragment09","2741","Though he was always in evidence_0 it was invariably Madame who did all the talking , giving_-0.121 orders_-0.206 , fussing around clients , so that Paula was never quite certain what his role_-0.031 was ."
"bmw-fragment09","2742","‘ Gary Oliver is a friend , ’ she said defensively_0 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2743","Madame Mattli snorted angrily ."
"bmw-fragment09","2744","‘ I do not pay you to have friends in rival fashion houses . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2745","‘ He 's not a rival … ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2746","Paula broke_-0.114 off ."
"bmw-fragment09","2747","It seemed ridiculous that a newcomer like Gary could be any threat_0 to a well-established house like Mattli ."
"bmw-fragment09","2748","But in the cut-throat world_-0.147 of fashion up and coming designers were to be feared — and already Gary 's reputation was growing_-0.097 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2749","‘ You know that we insist on complete_-0.118 loyalty , ’ Madame Mattli continued ."
"bmw-fragment09","2750","‘ The security of our designs_0.03 is paramount ."
"bmw-fragment09","2751","Oh Paula , how could you ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2752","‘ But I would never mention anything I have seen here ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2753","Paula protested ."
"bmw-fragment09","2754","Madame snorted again ."
"bmw-fragment09","2755","‘ How can I be sure of that ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2756","Even if you do not intend to be disloyal there is always the risk that you might be careless ."
"bmw-fragment09","2757","Pillow talk is the most dangerous . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2758","‘ Pillow talk ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2759","Paula repeated , stunned_0.03 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2760","Close_-0.2 though her friendship with Gary had become she had never once breathed_0.03 a word to him about the new collections she saw taking_-0.281 shape_0.03 at Mattli — and as for ‘ pillow talk ’ the notion was absurd ."
"bmw-fragment09","2761","There was nothing like that between them and never would be ."
"bmw-fragment09","2762","Gary was not interested in girls ."
"bmw-fragment09","2763","Surely that must be obvious to everyone who met him ."
"bmw-fragment09","2764","‘ You must stop visiting him , ’ Madame said firmly_-0.091 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2765","‘ Either I have your word_-0.091 on It or I am afraid you can no longer remain in my employ ."
"bmw-fragment09","2766","I want you to promise me here and now that you will not see Gary Oliver again . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2767","Paula was trembling ."
"bmw-fragment09","2768","Her job with the House of Mattli was her life_0 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2769","But to allow herself to be dictated_0.441 to in this way_-0.333 when she knew she had done nothing wrong was tantamount to admitting_0.061 guilt ."
"bmw-fragment09","2770","And she could n't bear_0.273 the thought of being sucked_0.294 back into the ebb_0.438 tide_0.147 of loneliness again either ."
"bmw-fragment09","2771","With Gary she enjoyed_-0.25 a relationship she had never experienced with anyone else — the easy-going friendship of a male who made_-0.531 no demands whatever on her — and it meant_-0.206 more to her than she had realised ."
"bmw-fragment09","2772","‘ I have never betrayed_0.286 any confidence and I never will ."
"bmw-fragment09","2773","But you ca n't expect me to cut_-0.061 myself off from my friends , ’ she said ."
"bmw-fragment09","2774","‘ I am afraid I do expect it , Paula , in this case . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2775","‘ I ca n't promise not to see Gary again . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2776","‘ Very well . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2777","There was a hint_-0.03 of sadness now in Madame 's eyes but her mouth was set_0.062 and determined_0.029 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2778","‘ I shall be sorry to lose_-0.25 you , Paula ."
"bmw-fragment09","2779","You are a good model_0.061 and you suited_-0.029 me very well ."
"bmw-fragment09","2780","But you leave_-0.303 me no choice ."
"bmw-fragment09","2781","Please do not bother to come in again ."
"bmw-fragment09","2782","I shall contact the agency for a replacement immediately_0.212 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2783","And I warn you , if any of my designs_0.029 or anything like them turn_0 up in the showroom at the House of Oliver I shall sue — and win the sort of damages_0.206 that will put_-0.333 your little friend out of business for good ."
"bmw-fragment09","2784","Do I make_-0.345 myself clear_-0.182 ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2785","Paula was still afraid of Madame Mattli — and she was also close_-0.484 to tears ."
"bmw-fragment09","2786","But she was determined Madame should not be aware of either ."
"bmw-fragment09","2787","‘ Yes , Madame ."
"bmw-fragment09","2788","I 'm sorry to leave_-0.469 you , but I assure you you need not worry_-0.314 on that score_-0.182 . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2789","The showrooms of the House of Oliver were smaller and less grand than those at the House of Mattli but the décor was newer and fresher_0.303 , pale_0.029 grey drapes , ultra modern black furniture and a great deal_0.061 of gleaming stainless steel ."
"bmw-fragment09","2790","Gary was in the workroom when Paula arrived , pinning a length of vibrant_0.312 pink chiffon sarong-style around one of his models_0.152 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2791","His mouth was full of pins ."
"bmw-fragment09","2792","‘ What are you doing here ? ’ he asked without moving his lips ."
"bmw-fragment09","2793","Paula perched_0.471 herself against the cutting table trying_0 to look nonchalant ."
"bmw-fragment09","2794","‘ I 've left_-0.394 Mattli , ’ she said ."
"bmw-fragment09","2795","Gary stared at her for a moment , pins spewing_0.387 from his mouth and catching_-0.118 on the front of his black jersey ."
"bmw-fragment09","2796","Then he unpinned the length of chiffon and let it fall to the floor ."
"bmw-fragment09","2797","The model_0.061 stood motionless , clad in nothing but her bra and stockings , waiting for his instructions ."
"bmw-fragment09","2798","‘ We 'll leave_-0.242 this for now , Claudia ’ , he said ."
"bmw-fragment09","2799","‘ See_-0.5 if you can rustle up a cup of tea for Paula and me , please . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2800","The girl pulled on her wrap and moved to the door looking back over her shoulder as she went and Paula was aware of the hostility in her gaze ."
"bmw-fragment09","2801","Why was it all women hated her so , even when they did n't know her ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2802","She shrugged ."
"bmw-fragment09","2803","Oh well , she should be used to it by now …"
"bmw-fragment09","2804","Gary got up , took Paula by the arm and led her over to the low sofa ."
"bmw-fragment09","2805","‘ What 's all this about , lovey ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2806","You ca n't have left_-0.176 Mattli . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2807","‘ I have . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2808","Paula related_0.061 what had happened and saw Gary turn pale ."
"bmw-fragment09","2809","‘ Oh Lord !"
"bmw-fragment09","2810","You mean she thinks you 've been spying for me !"
"bmw-fragment09","2811","If she sues I 'll be ruined_0 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2812","Even worse , someone of her stature_0.324 could make_-0.471 a hell_0.059 of a lot of trouble for me , even if she does n't . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2813","‘ But Gary — I have n't been spying for you !"
"bmw-fragment09","2814","I have n't even mentioned a single detail of the Mattli collection . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2815","‘ You know that and so do I. But suppose I 've done something similar ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2816","It happens every season — by sheer_0.294 chance and law_0.029 of averages some of the ideas are bound_0.188 to come_-0.5 up ."
"bmw-fragment09","2817","There are always accusations of piracy_0.097 and copy-catting , though they ca n't usually be substantiated ."
"bmw-fragment09","2818","But if she can prove that you and I … ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2819","‘ That 's nonsense !"
"bmw-fragment09","2820","We have n't done anything wrong . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2821","Gary ran_-0.147 a distracted_-0.118 hand through his mop_-0.029 of fair_0.156 hair ."
"bmw-fragment09","2822","‘ You 're going to have to describe the Mattli collection to me ."
"bmw-fragment09","2823","Every detail . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2824","‘ Gary ! ’ she objected , shocked_0.206 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2825","‘ You 're an original_0 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2826","You ca n't steal_-0.156 their ideas ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2827","‘ No , idiot — not so that I can steal_0.118 them ."
"bmw-fragment09","2828","So that I can go_-0.688 through my designs_0.088 and make_-0.286 quite certain that there is not one collar , not one cuff detail , not the slightest_0.03 influence that they could accuse me of copying_0.121 from them ."
"bmw-fragment09","2829","Oh Jesus Christ ! — suppose there 's something major ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2830","My peg top evening gown — my beautiful cerise lace — I could end up having to rethink the whole_-0.485 collection ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2831","‘ For goodness sake stop panicking ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2832","Paula said , though she could feel the seeds_0.303 of panic herself ."
"bmw-fragment09","2833","‘ I 'm sure there 's nothing to worry_-0.212 about . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2834","‘ I only hope you 're right ! ’ he said in anguished_0.062 tones ."
"bmw-fragment09","2835","The model_-0.029 came in with the cups of tea , still glowering darkly_0.143 at Paula from beneath her fringe of false_0.118 eyelashes ."
"bmw-fragment09","2836","It was clear_-0.294 she was blaming Paula bitterly for the interrupted_0.265 afternoon and her boss 's drastic change of mood ."
"bmw-fragment09","2837","‘ That girl is a dog_0.029 ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2838","Paula said when they were alone again ."
"bmw-fragment09","2839","‘ I 'm sure she ca n't do justice_0.645 to your designs_-0.03 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2840","And with a miserable_0.188 face like hers I 'm surprised you ever get_-0.333 any work done at all . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2841","Gary looked crestfallen ."
"bmw-fragment09","2842","‘ She 's the best I could get … ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2843","‘ Oh what rubbish_0.121 ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2844","Paula said roundly ."
"bmw-fragment09","2845","‘ Anyway , you 've got me now so you can get_-0.286 rid_-0.182 of her . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2846","‘ What do you mean ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2847","Gary asked ."
"bmw-fragment09","2848","He looked like a worried small boy ."
"bmw-fragment09","2849","‘ I told you — I 've left_-0.156 Mattli ."
"bmw-fragment09","2850","I 'll come and work for you . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2851","‘ Oh Paula ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2852","Gary 's expression_-0.303 became even more anxious ."
"bmw-fragment09","2853","‘ You know I 'd give my right arm to have someone as good as you to model_-0.031 for me !"
"bmw-fragment09","2854","But I told you before_-0.424 — I could n't afford to pay you what you 're worth ."
"bmw-fragment09","2855","Well , not for ages , anyway ."
"bmw-fragment09","2856","It 's going to be a long_-0.222 struggle_0.306 getting established and until I am I do n't see_-0.455 how … ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2857","Paula smiled ."
"bmw-fragment09","2858","For the first time she felt the stirrings_0.353 of something like power_0 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2859","It was not unlike the feeling she experienced when men looked at her and wanted her though she knew it could not be that for there was nothing sexual between her and Gary and never would be ."
"bmw-fragment09","2860","But it was just as exciting , nevertheless ."
"bmw-fragment09","2861","It made_-0.312 her feel strong_-0.242 , invincible almost , and just a tiny bit as if she had drunk_0.121 too much wine_0.143 ."
"bmw-fragment09","2862","Her smile spread_0.455 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2036","Grant 's remains were shovelled into a canvas bag ."
"bpa-fragment14","2037","Tense_0.314 , facing outwards , Forster , Lawton and Nell guarded Delaney as he intoned the seaman 's prayer of interment , and then committed_0.182 the canvas bag to the ocean ."
"bpa-fragment14","2038","The storm was abating rapidly , the evening sky clearing_-0.121 in the west with the golden_0.219 rays of the setting_-0.091 sun adding_-0.176 a dying_0.382 colour to the sullen_0.529 slate blue water ."
"bpa-fragment14","2039","The whiteness of the canvas body-bag dimmed_0.382 beneath the onrushing sea , faded_-0.061 at the edges , then grew smaller , greener , and was gone_-0.344 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2040","They returned to the bridge , fearful of every dark place — every corner , every door ."
"bpa-fragment14","2041","The gangway lamps seemed to give_-0.412 no light , only add_0.118 further to the gloom of the dusk ."
"bpa-fragment14","2042","Back in the wheelhouse , Delaney faced them ."
"bpa-fragment14","2043","‘ Right ."
"bpa-fragment14","2044","You all know the score_-0.062 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2045","As I see_-0.412 it we 've got_-0.375 two choices ."
"bpa-fragment14","2046","One , we get out of here now ."
"bpa-fragment14","2047","Launch the lifeboat , take_-0.344 our chances , or … two , we go after whatever it is . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2048","Nobody spoke immediately ."
"bpa-fragment14","2049","Finally Forster glanced at Lawton for support_0.029 , and drawled laconically ."
"bpa-fragment14","2050","‘ I 'm not leaving here until we 've done for that bastard_0.294 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2051","It 's personal from now on in ! ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2052","Lawton nodded his agreement ."
"bpa-fragment14","2053","‘ Yes , ’ he said , ‘ I feel_-0.618 the same . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2054","‘ Nell ? ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2055","Delaney asked , looking at her squarely ."
"bpa-fragment14","2056","‘ I agree , ’ she said without hesitation ."
"bpa-fragment14","2057","Their tense_0.094 , edgy_0.273 faces watched_0.121 Delaney closely_-0.429 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2058","‘ We do n't know what we 're up against , ’ Delaney said , ‘ so let's proceed_0.143 with maximum caution . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2059","‘ Trouble is , ’ Lawton said , with a frown , ‘ there are n't enough of us to search the ship ."
"bpa-fragment14","2060","It can work_-0.226 its way_-0.441 past us , and hide again ."
"bpa-fragment14","2061","We could still be looking for it when they blow_0.441 us out of the water . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2062","‘ That 's why we 've got to take_-0.588 risks , ’ Nell put_-0.314 in ."
"bpa-fragment14","2063","‘ Lure_0.097 it into a trap_-0.094 , somehow ."
"bpa-fragment14","2064","And quickly ."
"bpa-fragment14","2065","Forster 's chuckle was mirthless ."
"bpa-fragment14","2066","‘ I do n't think this joker_0.147 is going to need much encouragement . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2067","‘ No . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2068","Delaney was momentarily thoughtful ."
"bpa-fragment14","2069","‘ What had you in mind , Nell ? ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2070","She pointed to the figure of a man propped in the corner , and the cylinders of oxygen in the back pack lying_0.086 beside it ."
"bpa-fragment14","2071","‘ Two of our number have been killed ."
"bpa-fragment14","2072","Each time when they were on their own ."
"bpa-fragment14","2073","Let's give_-0.194 it the same conditions , only this time we use that as the bait_0.133 . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2074","They looked at the ‘ man_0.065 ’ Forster had found ."
"bpa-fragment14","2075","It was a safety suit , an advanced model of the NBC type with its own oxygen tanks ."
"bpa-fragment14","2076","‘ One in ambush , with the rest of us acting like beaters_0.559 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2077","Start at one end of the ship , making_-0.206 as much noise as possible . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2078","Forster grunted ."
"bpa-fragment14","2079","‘ It had no trouble finding Grant ."
"bpa-fragment14","2080","I think it 's a good idea ."
"bpa-fragment14","2081","And I 'll go in the suit until we reach_-0.212 the ambush point_-0.088 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2082","Might help to draw_-0.097 it . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2083","They helped him kit up , Nell connecting the leads_0.091 from the back pack into the suit attachments ."
"bpa-fragment14","2084","Forster 's breathing whistled_0.424 out of the one-way valve ."
"bpa-fragment14","2085","Behind the clear , wide vizor , he tried to smile ."
"bpa-fragment14","2086","‘ Cosy in here , ’ he joked ."
"bpa-fragment14","2087","‘ Even got my own toilet ."
"bpa-fragment14","2088","Bloody handy_0.455 in the circumstances . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2089","Delaney took_-0.314 the lead ."
"bpa-fragment14","2090","It was now light , the lamps on the gangway giving_-0.031 murky_0.212 yellow pools_-0.029 that barely pushed_-0.176 back the inky_0.273 blackness of a starless night ."
"bpa-fragment14","2091","At the entrance to the laboratory complex the others drew on their own masks ."
"bpa-fragment14","2092","Ineffectual or not against lingering gases it seemed a wise_-0.188 precaution , even if it was only psychological ."
"bpa-fragment14","2093","Delaney glanced back at them ."
"bpa-fragment14","2094","‘ Let's make_-0.121 sure it knows_-0.273 where we are . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2095","They made_-0.514 noise ; slammed doors ."
"bpa-fragment14","2096","Nell shuddered ."
"bpa-fragment14","2097","Were unseen eyes watching them ?"
"bpa-fragment14","2098","Was it even now shadowing_0.5 them , moving soundlessly from cover to cover , like a tiger_0.333 in the steel_0.353 jungle_0.091 ?"
"bpa-fragment14","2099","Forster 's radio-projected_0.161 voice broke_0.219 into her thoughts ."
"bpa-fragment14","2100","‘ Looks a good place . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2101","He was at the entrance to the secure_-0.29 lab zone ."
"bpa-fragment14","2102","‘ This must be the only way in , ’ Nell said ."
"bpa-fragment14","2103","Forster was quickly de-suited ."
"bpa-fragment14","2104","As they set up the now empty suit with its back_-0.061 to the door , half slumped_0.265 over a control panel , he settled down behind the curtained entrance of the showers ."
"bpa-fragment14","2105","Delaney 's voice was hushed ."
"bpa-fragment14","2106","‘ Maybe we should leave two of us here ? ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2107","‘ Do n't want to rouse_0.4 any suspicions ."
"bpa-fragment14","2108","Forster was adamant ."
"bpa-fragment14","2109","‘ After all , it might be able_-0.382 to count . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2110","When he did n't get_-0.281 any response , he patted the Uzi beside him on the steel floor ."
"bpa-fragment14","2111","‘ I wo n't be unprepared like poor_-0.118 old_-0.286 Grant . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2112","Delaney pulled the curtain across , covering Forster who cut a small slit in the opaque green plastic , widening it to give_-0.406 himself a better field_0 of view ."
"bpa-fragment14","2113","Lawton came and crouched down in front of it ."
"bpa-fragment14","2114","‘ I 've left_-0.206 the suit 's radio on full_0.129 , ’ he said ."
"bpa-fragment14","2115","‘ Make_-0.382 it sound interesting if we talk occasionally . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2116","He hesitated ."
"bpa-fragment14","2117","‘ Good luck . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2118","‘ I feel like a Maharajah_0.469 waiting_-0.129 for the tiger_0.324 to pounce_0.265 on the tied-up_-0.009 goat_0.143 , ’ Forster grinned ."
"bpa-fragment14","2119","‘ I hope I do n't have to wait all night . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2120","Nell shuddered ."
"bpa-fragment14","2121","Night ."
"bpa-fragment14","2122","This was a night in their minds — a creature from the darker_0.229 side_-0.182 of man 's intellect ."
"bpa-fragment14","2123","Something worried her about that thought ."
"bpa-fragment14","2124","Something hidden_0 behind the more obvious sentiment ."
"bpa-fragment14","2125","After they 'd gone , Forster felt_0.062 the silence physically_0.219 settle_0.286 around him ."
"bpa-fragment14","2126","He 'd never been one to exercise_0.355 an over-imagination_0.303 , yet the conditions were like the feeling_0.061 of a tomb_0.219 — of an interment_0.457 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2127","Would he be found , he mused , a thousand years from then , a dust-covered skeleton ?"
"bpa-fragment14","2128","He chuckled ."
"bpa-fragment14","2129","And the Uzi a primitive_0.233 weapon , the bio suit mistaken_0.032 for some sort_-0.125 of ceremonial_0.343 armour_0.394 ?"
"bpa-fragment14","2130","The first stunning silence gave_-0.229 way_-0.125 to the creaking of the ship and a far-off booming of the sea against the hull ."
"bpa-fragment14","2131","The radio on the dummy_0.062 suddenly screeched_0.412 into action_-0.061 as Delaney 's distorted voice gave_-0.529 it life_0.088 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2132","The thousands of tons of steel made_-0.312 real communication impossible ."
"bpa-fragment14","2133","His own radio was off ."
"bpa-fragment14","2134","Forster settled down , only putting his eye to the slit every half minute , not continually as he had started to do ."
"bpa-fragment14","2135","He had a good view of the long shadowy main corridor ."
"bpa-fragment14","2136","The only problem was if — he corrected_-0.294 himself — when it came , which side turning , if any , would it use_-0.515 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2137","The further away the better ."
"bpa-fragment14","2138","The more time to see it approach ."
"bpa-fragment14","2139","The trouble was the transverse corridor just outside the room ."
"bpa-fragment14","2140","If the approach was that way he would get_-0.273 no warning at all , and it would be on top of George — his name for the dummy_0.2 sitting_0 like a drunken_0.323 son-of-a-bitch_0.387 — before he knew it ."
"bpa-fragment14","2141","If that happened , he 'd have to work fast ."
"bpa-fragment14","2142","What he 'd seen done to Grant made_-0.5 Forster realise that whatever it was struck with demonic speed and savagery ."
"bpa-fragment14","2143","In seconds , poor_-0.118 old_-0.273 George would be spread around the room like an explosion_0.656 in Harrod 's window_0.118 , and the thing would be away ."
"bpa-fragment14","2144","Or on him ."
"bpa-fragment14","2145","As if in protest , George uttered_0.111 a blood-curdling , lunatic-sounding cackle_0.4 , and fell fractionally forward ."
"bpa-fragment14","2146","Forster suppressed a nervous_0.257 giggle ."
"bpa-fragment14","2147","They reached_-0.118 the main deck , dropping down"
"bpa-fragment14","2148","in a defensive posture , eyes searching_-0.094 the stacked containers , trying to probe_0.294 the black , jagged_0.588 recesses_0.375 between them ."
"bpa-fragment14","2149","Lawton scanned upwards ."
"bpa-fragment14","2150","‘ It could be anywhere ."
"bpa-fragment14","2151","Even back on the bridge again . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2152","‘ We should start in the engine room , ’ Nell suggested , shivering , ‘ work up through the crew 's quarters , and then into the complex . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2153","Confronted_-0.118 with the need to proceed ,"
"bpa-fragment14","2154","Delaney took_-0.364 risks , plummeting feet first through the hatchways , and partly breaking_0 his descent with the handrails , falling like a parachutist_0.667 , rolling instantly deploying his Uzi against …"
"bpa-fragment14","2155","Against what ?"
"bpa-fragment14","2156","Like Forster , all he could guess was that it was fast ."
"bpa-fragment14","2157","Grant may have been lame , but … fast or silent ?"
"bpa-fragment14","2158","Or both ?"
"bpa-fragment14","2159","The speed of descent must have cut_-0.286 down the exposure to any residual gas since he felt_-0.182 none of the earlier weirdness as he approached the still sealed engine room door ."
"bpa-fragment14","2160","Pandora 's Box_0.25 ?"
"bpa-fragment14","2161","He winced at the memory as he hammered on the steel and then looked through the spy_0.212 port_0.382 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2162","In the stroboscopic_0.571 view , the giant pistons were the only things moving — until a figure detached itself from the wall , its grey colour exactly that of the background steel ."
"bpa-fragment14","2163","Like a chameleon_0.5 , it moved out of the aisle between machines , then stopped , and became utterly motionless ."
"bpa-fragment14","2164","Delaney 's stillness caught_0.182 the attention of the others ."
"bpa-fragment14","2165","Nell 's transceivered_0.548 voice crackled in his headphones ."
"bpa-fragment14","2166","‘ What is it ? ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2167","He did n't want to take_-0.333 his eyes from it — equally he wanted somebody else to see it ."
"bpa-fragment14","2168","To confirm ."
"bpa-fragment14","2169","Gently_0.152 as though he might disturb it , he pulled back ."
"bpa-fragment14","2170","‘ Take_-0.382 a look for yourself . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2171","She did — and caught_-0.176 her breath ."
"bpa-fragment14","2172","The creature was large-headed , absurdly so , its body half man , half something lost_-0.029 in the primordial past ."
"bpa-fragment14","2173","But there could be no doubt that fundamentally it was … human ."
"bpa-fragment14","2174","Nell knew , and not only because she was a female of the same species ."
"bpa-fragment14","2175","She could see in its eyes — intelligence ."
"bpa-fragment14","2176","And human fear ."
"bpa-fragment14","2177","But also , as a doctor , she knew exactly what it was ."
"bpa-fragment14","2178","She told Delaney , who shook his head with revulsion ."
"bpa-fragment14","2179","Nell would never rest until she could get closer to confirm her worst suspicions , and paradoxically it was the woman in her that provided the intensity of emotion that would let nothing stand_-0.114 in her way_-0.286 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2180","George , the sacrificial dummy_0.235 , had n't emitted a squeak for a long_-0.059 time ."
"bpa-fragment14","2181","Forster scanned the corridor once more ."
"bpa-fragment14","2182","It was empty ."
"bpa-fragment14","2183","just as it always had been ."
"bpa-fragment14","2184","He sat back again , eyeing the blank wall before him , confident that he 'd catch it , however good it was ."
"bpa-fragment14","2185","He kept wondering how it had got_-0.4 Silk ."
"bpa-fragment14","2186","Silk was the meanest , toughest_-0.094 professional he 'd ever known ."
"bpa-fragment14","2187","And yet he 'd disappeared , without trace ."
"bpa-fragment14","2188","Forster was a fatalist ."
"bpa-fragment14","2189","He shrugged ."
"bpa-fragment14","2190","You could be James Bond , he thought , but if something had your number_0.176 on it …"
"bpa-fragment14","2191","A gentle_-0.156 breeze broke_0.294 the absolute silence , moving the curtain so that he had to steady it with his hand ."
"bpa-fragment14","2192","Instantly alert , Forster checked through his spy_0 port_0.324 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2193","Nothing ."
"bpa-fragment14","2194","But a door had opened somewhere ."
"bpa-fragment14","2195","Somebody , or something , had entered the complex ."
"bpa-fragment14","2196","It could be the others returning — or the start of his ambush ."
"bpa-fragment14","2197","‘ For God 's sake leave your mask on ."
"bpa-fragment14","2198","And that 's an order ! ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2199","But Delaney 's plea was in vain ."
"bpa-fragment14","2200","Nell pulled it off , got close to the door , and shouted ."
"bpa-fragment14","2201","‘ We mean you no harm ."

"bpa-fragment14","2203","When she checked through the spyhole it was standing in exactly the same spot_0.032 , unmoving , like a lizard_0.258 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2204","Lawton shook his head ."
"bpa-fragment14","2205","‘ Ca n't hear you ."
"bpa-fragment14","2206","Try the ship 's system again . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2207","Nell ran to the wall telephone , and pushed the digit for engine room ."
"bpa-fragment14","2208","The small light beneath the receiver_-0.059 rests showed_-0.057 that the line_0.031 was working_-0.242 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2209","Worried , Delaney followed , searching_0 her face , fearing the tell-tale signs_-0.114 of toxicity ."
"bpa-fragment14","2210","On impulse , and against his better judgment , he pulled off his own mask ."
"bpa-fragment14","2211","Nell repeatedly pressed the button , shouted across at Lawton , who was now using the spy_0.156 port_0.235 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2212","‘ What 's happening ? ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2213","The back_-0.206 of Lawton 's head shook , his radio-projected_0.364 voice crackling ."
"bpa-fragment14","2214","‘ Nothing now ."
"bpa-fragment14","2215","The head jerked_0.219 , just the once , to the left , so I reckon_0.152 it heard the ‘ phone . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2216","He straightened up and came over , directing_0.031 his question at Delaney ."
"bpa-fragment14","2217","‘ We ought to get on . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2218","Delaney nodded his agreement ."
"bpa-fragment14","2219","‘ Leave it , Nell . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2220","His tone was sharp_0.242 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2221","‘ It 's not going anywhere . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2222","She squared_0.353 up to him , defiantly ,"
"bpa-fragment14","2223","‘ I ca n't , John ."
"bpa-fragment14","2224","Do n't you see_-0.212 ?"
"bpa-fragment14","2225","The poor_0 thing is part_-0.455 of this madness ."
"bpa-fragment14","2226","If we can get to it , I can learn so much more ."
"bpa-fragment14","2227","And in any case , it might die if we do n't try and help it … soon . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2228","Delaney averted_0.5 his gaze from her , afraid of what he had seen in her eyes ."
"bpa-fragment14","2229","‘ Perhaps it would be better if it did . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2230","‘ You do n't mean that , ’ she said , stepping away from him ."
"bpa-fragment14","2231","Delaney fiddled_0.333 awkwardly with his mask , preparatory to putting it back on again ."
"bpa-fragment14","2232","‘ For God 's sake , Nell ."
"bpa-fragment14","2233","All I mean is , we 've got_-0.394 a job_-0.559 to do ."
"bpa-fragment14","2234","And Forster 's neck_0 's on the line_-0.182 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2235","Do n't you owe_-0.344 it to him to come now ? ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2236","She flushed_0.294 , but held on to the ‘ phone ."
"bpa-fragment14","2237","Obviously striving to be as controlled_0.25 as possible , she smiled ."
"bpa-fragment14","2238","‘ You two can manage_-0.147 , ’ she said calmly ."
"bpa-fragment14","2239","‘ I can do better here , on my own ."
"bpa-fragment14","2240","Quietly ."
"bpa-fragment14","2241","If I succeed it will unlock_0.028 a lot_-0.412 of the mystery of what 's been done on Titron ."
"bpa-fragment14","2242","And … ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2243","She faltered ."
"bpa-fragment14","2244","‘ … I think we owe_-0.171 it to that pathetic creature in there . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2245","‘ Pathetic ? ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2246","Delaney tried to play down the fear in his voice — fear for her ."
"bpa-fragment14","2247","‘ It might be bloody dangerous ."
"bpa-fragment14","2248","Certainly , something on this ship is . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2249","‘ Not this one , ’ Nell said , shaking her head with some kind of reassurance ."
"bpa-fragment14","2250","‘ I just know . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2251","Lawton gestured in the gangway ."
"bpa-fragment14","2252","‘ You may not be at risk from what is in here ."
"bpa-fragment14","2253","What about out there ?"
"bpa-fragment14","2254","There 's no guarantee that what we 're hunting is going to follow_-0.265 the rules_-0.25 . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2255","Nell shrugged ."
"bpa-fragment14","2256","‘ That 's a risk I 'll have to take_-0.242 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2257","I 've got_-0.545 a more important job_-0.576 here . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2258","Delaney knew there was no way_-0.364 she would be shifted_0.059 from her chosen course_-0.125 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2259","Ordering her would be ludicrous under the changed circumstances , and in any event , a waste_0.069 of time ."
"bpa-fragment14","2260","But Lawton was right ."
"bpa-fragment14","2261","The risk from the other danger , or dangers of Titron , frightened him more ."
"bpa-fragment14","2262","‘ Help me secure_0.257 the stairs behind us , ’ he snapped_0.088 at Lawton , ‘ as much as we can . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2263","Delaney turned to Nell ."
"bpa-fragment14","2264","‘ It might buy_-0.235 you the time you need ."
"bpa-fragment14","2265","But take_-0.355 care ."
"bpa-fragment14","2266","Do n't be bloody foolish like I am , leaving you here ."
"bpa-fragment14","2267","Establish contact_-0.212 if you can ."
"bpa-fragment14","2268","No more at this stage_0.057 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2269","Understand ?"
"bpa-fragment14","2270","And do n't try and get the door open . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2271","But Nell was hardly listening ."
"bpa-fragment14","2272","To please him she nodded , then despite Lawton 's presence , squeezed Delaney 's arm ."
"bpa-fragment14","2273","‘ And you . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2274","She smiled ."
"bpa-fragment14","2275","‘ Watch out . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2276","Reluctantly , Delaney made_-0.188 for the gangway ."
"bpa-fragment14","2277","Lawton had already shifted some chairs , in readiness to form a barricade ."
"bpa-fragment14","2278","He gave_-0.5 him a hand with a large oil drum_0.03 , and then another , as Nell , tearing_0.206 herself from her appointed task , dragged over a bench ."
"bpa-fragment14","2279","As they drew back up the stairs , piling on the pieces she threw up at them , Lawton sniffed ."
"bpa-fragment14","2280","‘ This wo n't hold_-0.242 anything ."
"bpa-fragment14","2281","Just slow it down . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2282","Like Forster before her , Nell indicated her pistol and grenades ."
"bpa-fragment14","2283","‘ As long as there 's ti me , that 's all we need . ’"
"bpa-fragment14","2284","As they descended the stairs , Delaney paused , and took_-0.314 a last look down at her ."
"bpa-fragment14","2285","She smiled shyly , then turned away ."
"bpa-fragment14","2286","In a sense , as long as he could convince himself that she was safe , he was glad she was n't coming with them ."
"bpa-fragment14","2287","Whatever it was they were after_-0.611 , it was an unknown quantity , unknown , that is , except for a lethal ferocity ."
"bpa-fragment14","2288","He pulled on his respirator , his mind made_-0.229 up to get back to her as soon as he could , for Nell Anderson was all he cared about now ."
"bpa-fragment14","2289","There it went again ."
"bpa-fragment14","2290","Forster frowned as he looked through his spy hole ."
"bpa-fragment14","2291","A sound ."
"bpa-fragment14","2292","He could n't place_-0.176 it , but it reminded him strongly_0.147 of something ."
"bpa-fragment14","2293","The corridor was empty ."
"bpa-fragment14","2294","It had happened three times now ."
"bpa-fragment14","2295","A hissing , We gas escaping_0.29 , ending with a funny_-0.152 little_0.125 squeak ."
"bpa-fragment14","2296","He looked at George , wondering if the sound had come_-0.188 from him ."
"bpa-fragment14","2297","Satisfied that everything was as it should be , he checked his watch ."
"bpa-fragment14","2298","Well over_-0.382 half an hour had passed_0.147 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2299","They ought to be near him soon ."
"bpa-fragment14","2300","Forster searched in a pouch and came up with a glucose sweet ."
"bpa-fragment14","2301","Quietly he unwrapped the covering paper , then paused , as some instinct made_-0.176 him check again ."
"bpa-fragment14","2302","As he did so , the sound came_-0.412 nearer ; louder ."
"bpa-fragment14","2303","His intense scrutiny took_-0.061 in the shadowy and empty lengths of the corridor ."
"bpa-fragment14","2304","Apart from some dark_-0.059 patches_-0.171 on the wall that he had n't noticed before_-0.765 , there was nothing to see ."
"bpa-fragment14","2305","His gaze came_-0.182 back to George , still sprawled over the control desk ."
"bpa-fragment14","2306","A fly landed on the empty , staring_0.424 vizor , and crawled across it ."
"bpa-fragment14","2307","Forster was sorely tempted to nip_0.083 out and confirm that the noise was coming_-0.314 from George by twiddling the volume and tuner , but fought_-0.156 down the urge ."
"bpa-fragment14","2308","He sat back , pulled off his mask , and popped_0.088 the sweet into his mouth ."
"bpa-fragment14","2309","It took_-0.333 him only seconds to notice the smell ."
"bpa-fragment14","2310","Forster choked as the putrefying reek seemed to get right into him ."
"bpa-fragment14","2311","Frightened that it was a gas pocket_0.206 , he fumbled with his mask , and finally got it back on ."
"bpa-fragment14","2312","His heart was thumping ."
"bpa-fragment14","2313","Nothing seemed to be happening , all his senses were apparently functioning normally , except … that the sweet in his mouth seemed permeated with the awful smell ; had become a slimy lump of filth ."
"bpa-fragment14","2314","He had to get rid of it ."
"bpa-fragment14","2315","Forster reached for his mask , just as the hissing_0.516 gas noise sounded right on top of him , ending with a little_-0.118 shriek ."
"bpa-fragment14","2316","He knew then where he 'd heard something similar before_-0.412 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2317","It was like a man breathing through a respiratory system , with some sort of one-way valve ."
"bpa-fragment14","2318","A shadow fell_-0.147 across the wall opposite , as slowly , and fearfully he turned ."
"bpa-fragment14","2319","The curtain was a dense_-0.062 , opaque greenish-yellow , and something was right behind it , a shape pressing against the humped_0.424 plastic standing there looking down at him , half seen , half imagined ."
"bpa-fragment14","2320","His hand went_-0.324 out , reached_-0.088 for the submachine gun , his fingers tightening_0.03 on the stock ."
"bpa-fragment14","2321","With a blood-curdling growl , the curtain was snatched aside ."
"bpa-fragment14","2322","Forster half_-0.176 rolled , his Uzi trembling_0.182 in his hand as he got_-0.171 off half a clip at point blank range_-0.206 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2323","But it struck with the speed of an attacking_0 snake_0.333 ."
"bpa-fragment14","2324","And something else ; something he saw as the curtain tore away and he looked into the depths_0.233 of the unbelievable face above him , fractionally dulled his reflexes ."
"c8t-fragment01","1","Friday 16 September to Tuesday 20 September"
"c8t-fragment01","2","Once free_-0.212 of the knotted_0.25 tentacles_0.562 of the eastern suburbs , Dalgliesh made_-0.091 good time and by three he was driving through Lydsett village ."
"c8t-fragment01","3","Here a right turn took_-0.188 him off the coastal road on to what was little more than a smoothly macadamed track bordered by water-filled ditches and fringed by a golden_0.455 haze_0.353 of reeds , their lumbered_0.455 heads_-0.2 straining_0.412 in the wind ."
"c8t-fragment01","4","And now , for the first time , he thought that he could smell the North Sea , that potent but half-illusory_0.029 tang evoking nostalgic memories of childhood holidays , of solitary adolescent walks as he struggled_0.333 with his first poems , of his aunt 's tall figure at his side , binoculars round her neck , striding towards the haunts_0.412 of her beloved birds ."
"c8t-fragment01","5","And here , barring_0.219 the road , was the familiar old farm gate still in place ."
"c8t-fragment01","6","Its continued presence always surprised_-0.059 him since it served_0 no purpose that he could see_-0.355 except symbolically_0.344 to cut_-0.171 off the headland_0.545 and to give_-0.29 travellers pause to consider whether they really wanted to continue ."
"c8t-fragment01","7","It swung open at his touch but closing it , as always , was more difficult and he lugged and half lifted it into place and slipped the circle of wire over the gatepost with a familiar_0.088 sensation of having turned_-0.147 his back_-0.303 on the workaday world_0.059 and entered country which , no matter how frequent his visits , would always be alien_0.529 territory_0.303 ."
"c8t-fragment01","8","He was driving now across the open headland towards the fringe of pine trees which bordered the North Sea ."
"c8t-fragment01","9","The only house to his left was the old Victorian rectory , a square , red-brick building , incongruous behind its struggling_0.152 hedge of rhododendron and laurel ."
"c8t-fragment01","10","To his right the ground rose_-0.065 gently_0.355 towards the southern cliffs and he could see the dark mouth_-0.03 of a concrete pillbox_0.485 , undemolished since the war , and as seemingly indestructible as the great hulks of wave-battered_0.394 concrete , remnants of the old fortifications which lay_-0.258 half-submerged_0.286 in the sand along part of the beach ."
"c8t-fragment01","11","To the north the broken arches and stumps_0.029 of the ruined Benedictine abbey gleamed golden_0.471 in the afternoon sun against the crinkled_0.152 blue of the sea and , breasting a small ridge , he glimpsed for the first time the topsail of Larksoken Mill and beyond it , against the skyline , the great grey bulk of Larksoken Nuclear power Station ."
"c8t-fragment01","12","The road he was on , veering_0.469 left , would lead_0 eventually to the station but was , he knew , seldom used since normal traffic and all heavy vehicles used_-0.559 the new access road to the north ."
"c8t-fragment01","13","The headland was empty and almost bare_0.333 , the few straggling_0.467 trees , distorted by the wind , struggled_0.152 to keep_-0.529 their precarious hold_-0.059 in the uncompromising_0.576 soil ."
"c8t-fragment01","14","And now he was passing a second and more dilapidated pillbox_0.414 and it struck_0.294 him that the whole headland had the desolate_0.529 look of an old battlefield , the corpses long since carted away but the air vibrating_0.323 still with the gunfire of long-lost_0.333 battles , while the power station loomed over it like a grandiose_0.471 modern_0.086 monument_0.267 to the unknown_-0.029 dead_0 ."
"c8t-fragment01","15","On his previous visits to Larksoken he had seen Martyr 's Cottage spread_0.031 out beneath him when he and his aunt had stood surveying the headland from the small top room under the cone of the mill ."
"c8t-fragment01","16","But he had never been closer to it than the road and now , driving up to it , it struck_0.156 him again that the description ‘ cottage ’ was hardly appropriate ."
"c8t-fragment01","17","It was a substantial , two-storey , L-shaped house standing_0.028 to the east of the track with walls partly flint and partly rendered , enclosing at the rear a courtyard of York stone which gave_-0.061 an uninterrupted view over fifty yards of scrub to the grassy dunes and the sea ."
"c8t-fragment01","18","No one appeared as he drew up and , before lifting his hand to the bell , he paused to read the words of a stone plaque embedded in the flints to the right of the door ."
"c8t-fragment01","19","In a cottage on this site lived Agnes Poley , Protestant martyr , burned at Ipswich , 15th August 1557 , aged 32 years ."
"c8t-fragment01","20","Ecclesiastes chapter 3 , verse 15 ."
"c8t-fragment01","21","The plaque was unadorned , the letters deeply carved in an elegant script reminiscent of Eric Gill , and Dalgliesh remembered his aunt telling him that it had been placed there by previous owners in the late twenties , when the cottage was originally extended ."
"c8t-fragment01","22","One of the advantages of a religious education is the ability to identify at least the better-known texts of scripture and this was one which it needed no effort of memory to recall_-0.182 ."
"c8t-fragment01","23","As a delinquent nine-year-old at his prep school , he had once been required by the headmaster to write out in his best handwriting the whole_-0.265 of the third chapter of Ecclesiastes , old Gumboil , economical in this as in all matters , believing that writing lines_0 should combine_-0.303 punishment with literary and religious education ."
"c8t-fragment01","24","The words , in that round childish script , had remained_-0.03 with him ."
"c8t-fragment01","25","It was , he thought , an interesting choice of text ."
"c8t-fragment01","26","That which hath been is now ; and that which is to be hath already been ; and God requireth that which is past ."
"c8t-fragment01","27","He rang and there was only a short_0.129 delay before Alice Mair opened the door ."
"c8t-fragment01","28","He saw a tall , handsome woman dressed with careful_-0.097 and expensive informality in a black cashmere sweater with a silk scarf at the throat and fawn trousers ."
"c8t-fragment01","29","He would have recognized her from her strong_-0.194 resemblance to her brother , although she looked the elder by some years ."
"c8t-fragment01","30","She took_-0.323 it for granted that each knew who the other was , and standing aside to motion him in she said : ‘ It 's good of you to be so accommodating , Mr Dalgliesh ."
"c8t-fragment01","31","I 'm afraid Nora Gurney is implacable ."
"c8t-fragment01","32","Once she knew you were on your way to Norfolk you were a predestined_0.618 victim_0 ."
"c8t-fragment01","33","Perhaps you would bring the proofs through to the kitchen . ’"
"c8t-fragment01","34","It was a distinguished face with the deep-set , widely spaced eyes beneath straight brows , a well-shaped , rather secretive_0.235 mouth and strong greying hair swept_0.029 upwards and curled into a chignon ."
"c8t-fragment01","35","In her publicity photographs she could , he recalled_-0.143 , look beautiful in a somewhat intimidating , intellectual_0.094 and very English mould_0.444 ."
"c8t-fragment01","36","But seen face to face , even in the informality of her own house , the absence of a spark_0.029 of sexuality and , he sensed , a deep-seated reserve , made_-0.412 her seem less feminine and more formidable than he had expected , and she held_-0.606 herself stiffly_0.324 as if repelling_0.333 invaders_0.324 of her personal space_-0.114 ."
"c8t-fragment01","37","The handshake with which she had greeted him had been cool_0.229 and firm and her brief_0 smile was surprisingly attractive ."
"c8t-fragment01","38","He knew that he was oversensitive to the timbre of the human voice and hers , although not jarring_0.286 or unpleasant , sounded a little forced as if she were deliberately speaking at an unnatural pitch ."
"c8t-fragment01","39","He followed her down the hall to the kitchen at the back_-0.161 of the house ."
"c8t-fragment01","40","It was , he judged , almost twenty feet long and obviously served_-0.03 the triple purpose of sitting room , working place and office ."
"c8t-fragment01","41","The right-hand half of the room was a well-equipped kitchen with a large gas stove and an Aga , a butcher 's chopping block , a dresser to the right of the door holding_0.118 an assortment of gleaming pots , and a long working surface with a wooden triangle sheathing_0.312 her assortment of knives ."
"c8t-fragment01","42","In the centre of the room was a large wooden table holding_-0.054 a stoneware jar of dried flowers ."
"c8t-fragment01","43","On the left-hand wall was a working_0.147 fireplace , the two recesses fitted_0.147 with wall-to-ceiling bookshelves ."
"c8t-fragment01","44","To each side of the hearth was a high-backed_-0.032 wicker armchair in an intricate closely woven design fitted_0.194 with patchwork cushions ."
"c8t-fragment01","45","There was an open roll-top desk facing one of the wide windows and , to its right , a stable door , the top half open , gave_-0.294 a view of the paved courtyard ."
"c8t-fragment01","46","Dalgliesh could glimpse what was obviously her herb garden planted in elegant terracotta pots carefully disposed to catch_-0.062 the sun ."
"c8t-fragment01","47","The room , which contained nothing superfluous , nothing pretentious , was both pleasing and extraordinarily comforting and , for a moment , he wondered why ."
"c8t-fragment01","48","Was it the faint_0.212 smell of herbs and newly baked dough , the soft_0 ticking of the wall-mounted_0.125 clock which seemed both to mark_-0.242 the passing_0.212 seconds and yet to hold_0.091 time in thrall , the rhythmic moaning_0.429 of the sea through the half-open door , the sense of well-fed_0.559 ease conveyed_0.226 by the two cushioned armchairs , the open hearth ?"
"c8t-fragment01","49","Or was it that the kitchen reminded Dalgliesh of that rectory kitchen where the lonely only child had found_-0.034 warmth_-0.118 and undemanding_0.281 , uncensorious_0.412 companionship , been given hot dripping toast and small forbidden treats ?"
"c8t-fragment01","50","He placed the proofs on the desk , refused Alice Mair 's offer of coffee and followed her back to the front door ."
"c8t-fragment01","51","She walked out with him to the car and said : ‘ I was sorry about your aunt — sorry for you , I mean ."
"c8t-fragment01","52","I expect that for an ornithologist death ceases to be terrible once sight and hearing begin to go_-0.303 ."
"c8t-fragment01","53","And to die in one 's sleep without distress to oneself or inconvenience to others is an enviable end_-0.029 ."
"c8t-fragment01","54","But you had known her for so long that she must have seemed immortal . ’"
"c8t-fragment01","55","Formal_0.194 condolences , he thought , were never easy to speak or accept and usually sounded either banal or insincere ."
"c8t-fragment01","56","Hers had been perceptive ."
"c8t-fragment01","57","Jane Dalgliesh had indeed seemed to him immortal ."
"c8t-fragment01","58","The very old , he thought , make_-0.324 our past ."
"c8t-fragment01","59","Once they go it seems for a moment that neither it nor we have any real existence ."
"c8t-fragment01","60","He said : ‘ I do n't think death was ever terrible to her ."
"c8t-fragment01","61","I 'm not sure that I really knew her and I 'm left wishing I 'd tried harder ."
"c8t-fragment01","62","But I shall miss her . ’"
"c8t-fragment01","63","Alice Mair said : ‘ I did n't know her either ."
"c8t-fragment01","64","Perhaps I should have tried harder too ."
"c8t-fragment01","65","She was a very private woman , I suspect one of those fortunate people who find_-0.206 no other company more agreeable than their own ."
"c8t-fragment01","66","It always seems presumptuous to encroach_0.394 on that self-sufficiency ."
"c8t-fragment01","67","Perhaps you share_-0.281 it ."
"c8t-fragment01","68","But if you can tolerate company , I 'm having a few people , mostly colleagues of Alex from the power station , to dinner on Thursday night ."
"c8t-fragment01","69","Would you care to join us ?"
"c8t-fragment01","70","Seven thirty for eight . ’"
"c8t-fragment01","71","It sounded , he thought , more like a challenge than an invitation ."
"c8t-fragment01","72","Somewhat to his surprise , Dalgliesh found_-0.212 himself accepting ."
"c8t-fragment01","73","But then the whole_-0.094 encounter had been a little surprising ."
"c8t-fragment01","74","She stood regarding him with a serious_0.188 intensity as he let in the clutch and turned the car and he had the impression_0.097 that she was watching critically to see how he handled_-0.152 it ."
"c8t-fragment01","75","But at least , he thought as he gave_-0.667 a final wave , she had n't asked him whether he had come to Norfolk to help catch the Whistler ."
"c8t-fragment01","76","Three minutes later he raised his foot from the accelerator ."
"c8t-fragment01","77","Ahead of him , trudging along on the left of the path , was a little group of children , the eldest girl wheeling a pushchair with two smaller children , one each side of her , clutching the bars ."
"c8t-fragment01","78","Hearing the noise of the car she turned and he saw a peaked_0.176 , delicate face framed_0.029 with red-gold_0.059 hair ."
"c8t-fragment01","79","He recognized the Blaney children , met once before with their mother walking along the beach ."
"c8t-fragment01","80","Obviously the eldest girl had been shopping : the folding pushchair had a shelf under the seat lumped high with plastic bags ."
"c8t-fragment01","81","Instinctively he slowed down ."
"c8t-fragment01","82","They were unlikely to be in real danger , the Whistler stalked at night , not in broad_0.333 daylight , and no vehicle had passed him since he left the coastal road ."
"c8t-fragment01","83","But the child looked grossly overburdened and ought not to be so far from home ."
"c8t-fragment01","84","Though he had never seen their cottage he seemed to remember that his aunt had told him that it lay_-0.094 about_-0.194 two miles to the south ."
"c8t-fragment01","85","He recalled_0.171 what he knew about them , that their father earned a precarious_0.182 living as a painter whose innocuous , prettified watercolours were sold in cafés and tourist shops along the coast and that their mother had been desperately ill with cancer ."
"c8t-fragment01","86","He wondered whether Mrs Blaney was still alive ."
"c8t-fragment01","87","His instinct was to pile the children into the car and drive them home but that , he knew , was hardly sensible ."
"c8t-fragment01","88","Almost certainly the eldest child — Theresa , was n't it ? — had been taught not to accept lifts from strangers , particularly men , and he was virtually a stranger ."
"c8t-fragment01","89","On an impulse_0.419 he reversed the Jaguar and drove quickly back to Martyr 's Cottage ."
"c8t-fragment01","90","This time the front door was open and a swathe_0.559 of sunlight lay_-0.057 across the red-tiled floor ."
"c8t-fragment01","91","Alice Mair had heard the car and came out to him from the kitchen , wiping her hands ."
"c8t-fragment01","92","He said : ‘ The Blaney children are walking home ."
"c8t-fragment01","93","Theresa is wheeling a pushchair and trying to cope with the twins ."
"c8t-fragment01","94","I thought I could offer a lift if I had a woman with me , someone they know . ’"
"c8t-fragment01","95","She said briefly : ‘ They know me . ’"
"c8t-fragment01","96","Without another word she went back into the kitchen then came out to him , closed the front door after her without locking it and got into the car ."
"c8t-fragment01","97","Putting it into gear , his arm brushed_0.343 her knee ."
"c8t-fragment01","98","He was aware of an almost imperceptible withdrawing_0 , more emotional than physical , a small_-0.118 delicate_0.412 gesture of self-containment_0.469 ."
"c8t-fragment01","99","Dalgliesh doubted whether that half-imagined_-0.029 recoil had anything to do with him personally , nor did he find_-0.324 her silence disconcerting ."
"c8t-fragment01","100","Their conversation , when they did speak , was brief_-0.265 ."
"c8t-fragment01","101","He asked : ‘ Is Mrs Blaney still alive ? ’"
"c8t-fragment01","102","‘ No ."
"c8t-fragment01","103","She died six weeks ago . ’"
"c8t-fragment01","104","‘ How are they managing_0.182 ? ’"
"c8t-fragment01","105","‘ Not particularly well , I imagine ."
"c8t-fragment01","106","But Ryan Blaney does n't welcome_-0.03 interference_0.529 ."
"c8t-fragment01","107","I sympathize ."
"c8t-fragment01","108","Once he lets_-0.355 down his defences_0.156 half the social workers in Norfolk , amateur and professional , will move_-0.152 in on him . ’"
"c8t-fragment01","109","When they drew up beside the little band it was Alice Mair who opened the car door and spoke ."
"c8t-fragment01","110","‘ Theresa , here is Mr Dalgliesh to give_-0.515 you all a lift ."
"c8t-fragment01","111","He 's Miss Dalgliesh 's nephew from Larksoken Mill ."
"c8t-fragment01","112","One of the twins had better sit on my lap ."
"c8t-fragment01","113","The rest of you and the pushchair can fit into the back_-0.485 . ’"
"c8t-fragment01","114","Theresa looked at Dalgliesh without smiling and said a grave thank you ."
"c8t-fragment01","115","She reminded him of pictures of the young Elizabeth Tudor , the same red-gold_-0.103 hair framing_0.226 a curiously adult face both secretive_0.167 and self-composed , the same sharp_-0.147 nose and wary_0.265 eyes ."
"c8t-fragment01","116","The faces of the twins , softer_0.057 editions_0.265 of her own , turned_0.031 towards her questioningly then broke_0.088 into shy_0.206 smiles ."
"c8t-fragment01","117","They looked as if they had been dressed in a hurry and not very suitably for a long_-0.147 walk on the headland , even in a warm autumn ."
"c8t-fragment01","118","One wore a tattered summer dress in pink spotted cotton with double flounces , the other a pinafore over a checked blouse ."
"c8t-fragment01","119","Their pathetically thin legs were unprotected ."
"c8t-fragment01","120","Theresa was wearing jeans and a grubby sweat shirt with a map of London 's Underground across the front ."
"c8t-fragment01","121","Dalgliesh found_-0.118 himself wondering if it had been brought back from a school trip to the capital ."
"c8t-fragment01","122","It was too large for her and the wide sleeves of limp cotton hung from her freckled arms like rags_0.062 thrown_0 over a stick_0.088 ."
"c8t-fragment01","123","In contrast_0.094 to his sisters , Anthony was over-clad_-0.171 , a bundle of leggings , jumper and a padded jacket topped with a woollen helmet with a bobble pulled well down over his forehead , beneath which he surveyed their busyness , unsmiling , like a stout_0.3 imperious_0.562 Caesar ."
"c8t-fragment01","124","Dalgliesh got out of the Jaguar and tried to extricate him from the pushchair , but the anatomy_0.364 of the chair momentarily defeated_0.125 him ."
"c8t-fragment01","125","There was a bar beneath which the child 's rigid legs were obstinately_0.412 stuck ."
"c8t-fragment01","126","The solid_0.242 uncooperative_0.219 bundle was surprisingly heavy ; it was like trying_-0.364 to manoeuvre_0.647 a firm_0.125 and rather smelly_0.182 poultice_0.625 ."
"c8t-fragment01","127","Theresa gave_-0.441 him a brief_-0.029 , pitying smile , dragged the plastic bags from beneath the seat then expertly freed her brother and settled him on her left hip while , with the other hand , she collapsed_0.257 the pushchair , with a single vigorous shake ."
"c8t-fragment01","128","Dalgliesh took the baby from her while Theresa helped the children into the Jaguar and commanded_0.088 with sudden fierceness , ‘ Sit still . ’"
"c8t-fragment01","129","Anthony , recognizing incompetence , grasped Dalgliesh 's hair firmly with a sticky hand and he felt the momentary touch of a cheek , so soft that it was like the fall_0.118 of a petal_0.485 ."
"c8t-fragment01","130","Throughout these manoeuvrings Alice Mair sat quietly watching from the car but made no move to help ."
"c8t-fragment01","131","It was impossible to know what she was thinking ."
"c8t-fragment01","132","But once the Jaguar had moved away she turned to Theresa and said in a voice of surprising gentleness : ‘ Does your father know that you 're out alone ? ’"
"c8t-fragment01","133","‘ Daddy has taken the van to Mr Sparks ."
"c8t-fragment01","134","It 's due for its MOT test ."
"c8t-fragment01","135","Mr Sparks does n't think it 's going to pass_0.088 ."
"c8t-fragment01","136","And I found_-0.125 we 'd run_-0.343 out of milk for Anthony ."
"c8t-fragment01","137","We have to have milk ."
"c8t-fragment01","138","And we wanted some more disposable nappies . ’"
"c8t-fragment01","139","Alice Mair said : ‘ I 'm giving_-0.294 a dinner party on Thursday evening ."
"c8t-fragment01","140","If your father agrees , would you like to come and help with the table like you did last month ? ’"
"c8t-fragment01","141","‘ What are you going to cook , Miss Mair ? ‘"
"c8t-fragment01","142","‘ Put your head close so that I can whisper ."
"c8t-fragment01","143","Mr Dalgliesh is going to be one of the guests ."
"c8t-fragment01","144","I want it to be a surprise . ‘"
"c8t-fragment01","145","The pale golden_0.182 head leaned forward towards the grey and Miss Mair whispered ."
"c8t-fragment01","146","Theresa smiled and then nodded with serious satisfaction in a moment of grave feminine conspiracy ."
"cb5-fragment02","3183","But next morning Ruth awakened early and , leaving Miss Beard to her gentle_0.364 dreams , dressed quickly and hurried out of the house ."
"cb5-fragment02","3184","It was another golden_0.438 day ."
"cb5-fragment02","3185","She still retained_0.312 her English habit_0.147 of noting_-0.059 each day 's weather , always expecting changes , marvelling at the hot sunny days which followed_0.061 one after the other , almost with monotony ."
"cb5-fragment02","3186","When she reached the plateau she remained standing , watching for Joss Barnet , waiting for the moment when she would see him riding towards her ."
"cb5-fragment02","3187","There was no longer any need for her to be"
"cb5-fragment02","3188","‘ discovered_0.273 ’ ."
"cb5-fragment02","3189","Her sole purpose in being there was to meet him and she was content that he should know it ."
"cb5-fragment02","3190","He was late this morning ."
"cb5-fragment02","3191","Or was she earlier than she thought ?"
"cb5-fragment02","3192","Had she misjudged_0.118 the time ?"
"cb5-fragment02","3193","No matter ."
"cb5-fragment02","3194","She was happy to wait for him , certain that soon she would see him riding towards her ."
"cb5-fragment02","3195","Then as the minutes passed_-0.029 and there was no sign_-0.147 of him , she considered_0.091 that perhaps he had overslept ."
"cb5-fragment02","3196","It could happen ."
"cb5-fragment02","3197","Or had his horse gone lame , cast a shoe ?"
"cb5-fragment02","3198","She sat down and prepared to wait as long as was necessary ."
"cb5-fragment02","3199","She knew that in the end_0.059 he would come ."
"cb5-fragment02","3200","After a few more minutes she became restless , and stood up again , her eyes searching_-0.061 the slope of the hillside and the valley below , trying_-0.343 to determine whether some small_-0.312 movement down there was a man on horseback or merely a trick_-0.121 of her imagination ."
"cb5-fragment02","3201","Should she set off down the hill to meet him ?"
"cb5-fragment02","3202","But perhaps he would come by another route and then she would miss_-0.182 him ."
"cb5-fragment02","3203","At the end_-0.406 of what she reckoned_0.364 must be an hour , she faced_-0.1 the fact that he was not coming ."
"cb5-fragment02","3204","She dropped to the ground again and lay down , burying_0.286 her face in the sweet-smelling_0.147 grass ."
"cb5-fragment02","3205","She had been mistaken ever to think that he would come ."
"cb5-fragment02","3206","She had let_-0.618 her overwhelming desire feed_-0.062 her imagination ; had read_0 something into his words , his looks , his actions , which had not been there_-0.424 at all ."
"cb5-fragment02","3207","Her face burned_0.125 with the shame of it ."
"cb5-fragment02","3208","Such was the feeling Joss Barnet had aroused_0.242 in her , that not for one moment did it occur to her to blame him for anything ."
"cb5-fragment02","3209","It was all her fault_-0.03 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3210","Sick at heart , she wept ."
"cb5-fragment02","3211","Then she dried her eyes on the hem of her petticoat and went slowly back to the house ."
"cb5-fragment02","3212","‘ So you 've decided to put_-0.147 in an appearance ? ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3213","Cook said ."
"cb5-fragment02","3214","‘ I do seem to recall_0.032 something about you offering to help me with the party preparations ."
"cb5-fragment02","3215","But of course if you 've changed_-0.061 your mind … ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3216","‘ I have n't , ’ Ruth snapped_0.212 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3217","‘ I 'm ready to start now ."
"cb5-fragment02","3218","I do n't want any breakfast . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3219","‘ Hoity-toity !"
"cb5-fragment02","3220","What 's the matter_-0.031 with everyone this morning ? ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3221","Cook demanded ."
"cb5-fragment02","3222","‘ There 's Sean O'Farrell and the master left in a hurry this hour past_-0.086 for New York City , both without a bite inside them — and now you . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3223","‘ Gone to New York ? ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3224","‘ That 's what I said . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3225","With Mrs Cranbrook 's words Ruth 's appetite immediately returned_-0.062 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3226","So he had not failed her after all !"
"cb5-fragment02","3227","How could she have thought that he would ?"
"cb5-fragment02","3228","Something unforeseen and urgent had happened , since Sean had obviously known of it yesterday afternoon , and there had been no opportunity for him to inform her ."
"cb5-fragment02","3229","Relief surged_0.265 through her like a physical_0.343 infusion_0.382 of new_-0.267 blood_0.062 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3230","‘ I 've changed_-0.394 my mind , ’ she said ."
"cb5-fragment02","3231","‘ I would like some breakfast ."
"cb5-fragment02","3232","Suddenly I 'm hungry ."
"cb5-fragment02","3233","When will they be back ? ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3234","‘ Sean ?"
"cb5-fragment02","3235","How should I know ?"
"cb5-fragment02","3236","I do n't understand business ."
"cb5-fragment02","3237","What I do understand is that if the master 's not home for the party tomorrow , the mistress wo n't be pleased — and that 's putting_-0.265 it mildly_-0.059 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3238","Do n't you dawdle over your breakfast then , not if you intend to make_-0.424 yourself useful_0.029 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3239","There 's plenty to be done . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3240","Ruth worked all that day as though she had the strength of ten ."
"cb5-fragment02","3241","They prepared chicken pies , the pastry as_-0.412 light_-0.03 as Ruth 's heart_-0.03 , turtle soup , a haunch of venison , jellies , blancmanges , syllabubs , trifles , and a host_-0.088 of other dishes , with still more to be done on the day of the party itself ."
"cb5-fragment02","3242","Mrs Cranbrook unbent so far_-0.206 as to show_-0.147 approval ."
"cb5-fragment02","3243","‘ You 've done very well , ’ she conceded_0.212 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3244","Mrs Carson , knowing how much was involved , had excused Ruth from all other duties until Anna 's bedtime hour ."
"cb5-fragment02","3245","And now it approached_0.03 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3246","She took off the voluminous apron Cook had lent her and went in search of her charge_0.121 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3247","Anna was in tears ."
"cb5-fragment02","3248","‘ We 're going home , ’ she sobbed ."
"cb5-fragment02","3249","‘ I do n't want to go back to Mrs Gutermann 's ."
"cb5-fragment02","3250","I want to stay with Edward ."
"cb5-fragment02","3251","I want to live with him for ever and ever ! ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3252","Ruth could think of few worse fates , but her stomach lurched_0.312 at the thought of leaving Millfield ."
"cb5-fragment02","3253","‘ How do you know we 're leaving ? ’ she asked ."
"cb5-fragment02","3254","‘ Who told you ? ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3255","‘ Miss Fitch , ’ Anna wailed ."
"cb5-fragment02","3256","‘ I do n't like Miss Fitch ."
"cb5-fragment02","3257","I hate her !"
"cb5-fragment02","3258","I daresay she wants me to go ! ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3259","‘ Perhaps she 's mistaken , ’ Ruth said , though she doubted if Miss Fitch was ever wrong ."
"cb5-fragment02","3260","‘ We 'll ask your mama the moment she comes in . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3261","‘ I 'm afraid it 's true , ’ Mrs Carson told them ."
"cb5-fragment02","3262","‘ Of course we were only invited for ten days or so . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3263","Ruth had lost_-0.242 count of time ."
"cb5-fragment02","3264","To her , the long_-0.406 summer days had stretched_0.091 ahead_-0.242 , world_-0.303 without end_-0.176 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3265","‘ We are going to leave on Sunday , ’ Mrs Carson went_-0.212 on ."
"cb5-fragment02","3266","‘ Not too early in the day , since I daresay we shall all be tired after tomorrow 's party . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3267","‘ Anna tells me she never wants to leave Edward , ’ Ruth said after the child had gone_-0.485 to sleep ."
"cb5-fragment02","3268","Mrs Carson smiled indulgently ."
"cb5-fragment02","3269","‘ Dearest Anna !"
"cb5-fragment02","3270","She 's a little young for a holiday infatuation , but we all have them sooner or later ."
"cb5-fragment02","3271","Thank goodness they never last_0.094 !"
"cb5-fragment02","3272","And the more intense_-0.156 they are , the shorter_-0.176 the duration , so Anna should soon be over it . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3273","‘ Will Mr Barnet be back for the party ? ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3274","Ruth asked ."
"cb5-fragment02","3275","‘ I expect you mean will O'Farrell be back , ’ Mrs Carson said ."
"cb5-fragment02","3276","‘ And the answer is , I do n't know ."
"cb5-fragment02","3277","Mrs Barnet tells me that she expects her husband when she sees him ."
"cb5-fragment02","3278","It 's a fact that American men seem to put_-0.118 business before everything ."
"cb5-fragment02","3279","Thank goodness Englishmen are not like that ! ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3280","Next morning Ruth was down in the kitchen early , eagerly hoping to find Sean there ."
"cb5-fragment02","3281","He could well have returned late at night and she not heard him , though she had stayed awake for a long_-0.242 time , listening for the sound of the horses , the carriage wheels on the drive ."
"cb5-fragment02","3282","There was no sign_0.061 of Sean but Mrs Cranbrook was already at work ."
"cb5-fragment02","3283","‘ I hope you 're ready to help me , ’ she said ."
"cb5-fragment02","3284","‘ Everybody is busy with this and that — as if food was n't the most important thing_-0.273 ! ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3285","‘ I 'll help , Mrs Cranbrook , ’ Ruth agreed ."
"cb5-fragment02","3286","‘ They 're not back then ? ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3287","She tried to sound nonchalant ."
"cb5-fragment02","3288","‘ Not back ?"
"cb5-fragment02","3289","Oh , you mean O'Farrell and the master ?"
"cb5-fragment02","3290","Not that I know of ."
"cb5-fragment02","3291","There 's no telling when they ‘ U return ."
"cb5-fragment02","3292","Sometimes they 're gone for three or four days at a time . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3293","‘ But surely … with the party ? ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3294","Mrs Cranbrook shrugged ."
"cb5-fragment02","3295","‘ He 's a law_-0.094 unto himself , the master ."
"cb5-fragment02","3296","Not for the likes of you and me to question why . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3297","The heart_0.029 had gone out of the day ."
"cb5-fragment02","3298","Ruth fetched and carried and stirred and whipped , praying every moment that Joss Barnet would return before they left Millfield next day ."
"cb5-fragment02","3299","But when the day had dragged_0.235 to evening — in spite of all there was to do the time now passed_-0.294 slowly_0 — and still there was no sign_-0.294 of the two men , she began to lose_-0.171 hope ."
"cb5-fragment02","3300","In the evening , bone-tired , she left the kitchen and went to put a reluctant Anna to bed ."
"cb5-fragment02","3301","Then she turned_-0.059 to helping Mrs Carson ."
"cb5-fragment02","3302","She brushed her mistress 's hair and piled it on top of her head in a cluster_0.233 of curls , carefully and meticulously arranged to look quite casual ."
"cb5-fragment02","3303","It was a style Ruth had devised herself and Mrs Carson was delighted with the result ."
"cb5-fragment02","3304","‘ It looks so different , ’ she said ."
"cb5-fragment02","3305","‘ You really are quite clever at this , Ruth ."
"cb5-fragment02","3306","And now for my dress . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3307","She looked beautiful in the yellow satin , the low-cut bodice tight against her slight figure , the skirt billowing out ."
"cb5-fragment02","3308","But Ruth had no heart_0.441 either to appreciate or to envy her mistress ."
"cb5-fragment02","3309","Her spirits_0 were at their lowest_0.088 ebb_0.242 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3310","Mrs Carson gave_-0.636 her maid a sharp_-0.088 , compassionate_0.4 look ."
"cb5-fragment02","3311","She thought she knew the cause of this mood and in a way_-0.742 she was glad to see it ."
"cb5-fragment02","3312","At least it showed_-0.147 that the girl 's mind was working_-0.147 in the right direction_-0.031 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3313","‘ Do n't worry , Ruth , ’ she said kindly ."
"cb5-fragment02","3314","‘ I dare say O'Farrell will be back tomorrow before we leave ."
"cb5-fragment02","3315","And if not , there is always New York when the Barnets return in the fall_0.059 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3316","And now I sha n't need you again this evening , so apart from looking in on Anna from time to time , you may do just as you please . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3317","Had she not been so downhearted Ruth would have enjoyed herself ."
"cb5-fragment02","3318","But she had given up all hope of Joss Barnet returning that evening and nothing else in the world mattered ."
"cb5-fragment02","3319","The party scene_0.031 was pretty enough ."
"cb5-fragment02","3320","Coloured lanterns hung in the trees which fringed the lawn and bordered the lake beyond ."
"cb5-fragment02","3321","Torchlights , flaring_0.5 against the night sky and reflected in the water , had been set up wherever it was suitable ."
"cb5-fragment02","3322","Already the orchestra had begun to play and the elegantly dressed to appear ."
"cb5-fragment02","3323","Ruth had no heart_-0.353 for it ."
"cb5-fragment02","3324","She climbed the stairs to her room , then undressed and went to bed , wetting the pillow with her tears which , held back all day , now flowed unchecked ."
"cb5-fragment02","3325","Her only comfort was not to have Miss Beard in her room , to be able to suffer in solitude ."
"cb5-fragment02","3326","Though she thought sleep would never come_-0.438 , eventually it did ."
"cb5-fragment02","3327","She fell_-0.206 asleep to the sound of music drifting_0.452 upwards from the drawing-room ."
"cb5-fragment02","3328","When she wakened it was still dark , the orchestra still playing , though it was not that which had aroused her ."
"cb5-fragment02","3329","Penetrating_0.176 her sleep she had heard the faint_-0.091 click of the door latch , and then the familiar squeak of the hinge as the door to her room slowly opened ."
"cb5-fragment02","3330","She raised herself on one elbow , blinking her eyes , trying to see in the darkness ."
"cb5-fragment02","3331","But enough light came_-0.206 from the landing on to which the door opened to silhouette the man standing there ."
"cb5-fragment02","3332","It was Joss Barnet ."
"cb5-fragment02","3333","Shock_0.324 made_-0.094 her cry out , and he closed the door and moved towards her in quick strides , putting his hand across her mouth to stop-her scream ."
"cb5-fragment02","3334","Then he sat on her bed and , without a word from either of them , she went willingly into his arms and was held close in his embrace ."
"cb5-fragment02","3335","She felt his heart beating_-0.061 strong_-0.094 and fast against hers ."
"cb5-fragment02","3336","They stayed like that for a long_0.03 moment and then he said , ‘ Light the candle . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3337","‘ I ca n't , ’ she whispered ."
"cb5-fragment02","3338","‘ Someone will see the light under the door . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3339","‘ No matter if they do , ’ he said ."
"cb5-fragment02","3340","‘ They will not think of me here ."
"cb5-fragment02","3341","Only my coachman knows I am home ."
"cb5-fragment02","3342","I have not yet joined_0.029 the party . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3343","‘ You came to me first ? ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3344","She could hardly believe it ."
"cb5-fragment02","3345","He would not tell her , this funny bewitching_0.656 little English girl , that he had come to her first because he could not keep away from her ."
"cb5-fragment02","3346","She had been on his mind since the morning he had seen her from his horse ; frightened yet defiant , sparking_0.375 with anger ."
"cb5-fragment02","3347","Almost , but not quite , she had come between him and the work he had had to do in New York City ."
"cb5-fragment02","3348","The moment the work was done he had ordered_-0.088 his coachman to drive him back to Millfield as fast as the horses would go ."
"cb5-fragment02","3349","‘ Light the candle , ’ he repeated ."
"cb5-fragment02","3350","Ruth 's fingers trembled_0.176 as she obeyed him ."
"cb5-fragment02","3351","Then she lay back on her pillow and they looked at each other as if it was for the first time ."
"cb5-fragment02","3352","He traced the contours of her face with gentle_0.03 fingers , outlining the curve of her mouth , stroking her temples ."
"cb5-fragment02","3353","Without any hurry , in spite of the impatience which had brought_-0.091 him here , he caressed the length of her neck and the slope_0.176 of her shoulders ."
"cb5-fragment02","3354","From out of nowhere , Ruth remembered Dick Parker : but not , this time , the pleasure of her union_0.294 with him , only the pain_-0.147 it had brought_-0.194 her on the Christmas Eve following_-0.029 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3355","And now although her whole body cried_-0.097 out for fulfilment and she longed for Joss Barnet to complete what he had surely come to do , she knew that she must not let it happen ."
"cb5-fragment02","3356","She turned her face away from him , pushed his hand from her ."
"cb5-fragment02","3357","‘ No ! ’ she cried ."
"cb5-fragment02","3358","‘ You must not ! ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3359","He gave_-0.091 not the slightest_-0.25 sign_-0.062 of having heard her , continuing to stroke her neck , and now inserting his fingers under the neckline of her nightshift ."
"cb5-fragment02","3360","She tried again to push him away ."
"cb5-fragment02","3361","‘ Please !"
"cb5-fragment02","3362","Please do n't ! ’ she cried ."
"cb5-fragment02","3363","It was surprise which made_-0.441 him stop for a second ."
"cb5-fragment02","3364","He smiled at her , an unexpectedly tender_0.265 smile ."
"cb5-fragment02","3365","‘ I wo n't hurt you , ’ he said ."
"cb5-fragment02","3366","‘ Do n't be afraid . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3367","‘ I 'm not afraid of being hurt . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3368","‘ Then what … ? ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3369","‘ I 'm afraid of afterwards , ’ she said hesitantly ."
"cb5-fragment02","3370","‘ If I were to have a child ."
"cb5-fragment02","3371","It would be the end_-0.353 of the world_0.03 for me . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3372","‘ But you wo n't , ’ he assured her ."
"cb5-fragment02","3373","‘ I 'll see_-0.412 to that ."
"cb5-fragment02","3374","I 'm not totally callous . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3375","‘ You promise ? ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3376","‘ I promise . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3377","She lay quiescent and felt his strong fingers , quicker now , move_-0.382 to unfasten the buttons of her shift one by one ."
"cb5-fragment02","3378","And when he had undone her gown , and had difficulty in lifting it over her head , she raised herself from the pillow and helped him to take it off ."
"cb5-fragment02","3379","Then he pulled down the sheet , which was all the bedclothes she had needed on that warm night , and she lay naked before him ."
"cb5-fragment02","3380","She observed him without shame as he looked at every part of her ."
"cb5-fragment02","3381","Her pleasure was in him , and in his delight of her ."
"cb5-fragment02","3382","When , at last , he stripped_0.088 off his clothes and came into her , it was as if this was the moment to which all her life had been leading_0.091 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3383","He was a skilful lover : tender and gentle in the beginning , then powerful , persistent , rough_0.147 almost — until , his passion rising_0 in harmony_0.086 with hers , the climax_0.258 came_-0.324 like the bursting_0.118 of a thousand stars_0.118 , like the beginning_-0.182 and ending_-0.03 of the world_0 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3384","Afterwards they lay quietly side by side , not speaking , until he said , ‘ I must go . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3385","‘ Not yet , ’ she begged ."
"cb5-fragment02","3386","‘ You ca n't leave me yet . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3387","She turned over and lay on top of him , trying to pin him down with her own slight weight , and he began to fondle her and she him , and almost at once they were making_-0.419 love again ."
"cb5-fragment02","3388","‘ You are a sorceress_0.333 , ’ he told her when it was all over ."
"cb5-fragment02","3389","‘ An enchantress_0.25 ."
"cb5-fragment02","3390","Women as tempting as you should be kept out of the sight of mortal men . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3391","‘ You 're not a mortal man , ’ Ruth said ."
"cb5-fragment02","3392","‘ You 're a god_0.188 ! ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3393","He laughed out loud ."
"cb5-fragment02","3394","‘ Hush ! ’ she cautioned ."
"cb5-fragment02","3395","‘ Someone will hear you . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3396","‘ I 'm a real man all right , ’ he said ."
"cb5-fragment02","3397","‘ As I 've just proved to you ."
"cb5-fragment02","3398","And would again if time allowed_0.167 . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3399","Then he stood up and quickly began to dress ."
"cb5-fragment02","3400","‘ I must go and do my duty as a host for what 's left_-0.469 of the night . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3401","‘ Do n't leave me , ’ she begged ."
"cb5-fragment02","3402","‘ Please stay ! ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3403","He looked at her in surprise , spoke brusquely ."
"cb5-fragment02","3404","‘ But of course I must go ."
"cb5-fragment02","3405","There 's no question . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3406","Long_-0.121 afterwards Ruth realised that this was the moment when she had learned that she could never come_-0.265 first with him ."
"cb5-fragment02","3407","However much he might desire her , she would have no more than the allotted space_0.029 in his life ."
"cb5-fragment02","3408","‘ When am I going to see you again ? ’ she asked ."
"cb5-fragment02","3409","That , also , was the wrong thing_-0.333 to say ."
"cb5-fragment02","3410","‘ I ca n't make_-0.343 plans_-0.147 , ’ he said sharply ."
"cb5-fragment02","3411","‘ But we leave tomorrow ! ’ she exclaimed ."
"cb5-fragment02","3412","That took_-0.514 him by surprise ."
"cb5-fragment02","3413","‘ The deuce_0.438 you do !"
"cb5-fragment02","3414","Well I shall see_-0.412 to that ."
"cb5-fragment02","3415","My wife will extend_0.031 the invitation to the Carsons ."
"cb5-fragment02","3416","I take_-0.2 it they 're not promised elsewhere ? ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3417","‘ Oh no , ’ Ruth said ."
"cb5-fragment02","3418","‘ We 're going back to New York City . ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3419","He finished dressing , then came and held her by the shoulders , kissing her lightly on the mouth ."
"cb5-fragment02","3420","As he was leaving he turned around and threw a small box on to the bed ."
"cb5-fragment02","3421","‘ From the city , ’ he said ."
"cb5-fragment02","3422","‘ You see that I had you in my mind ! ’"
"cb5-fragment02","3423","He was out of the room before she could open the box , a dark_-0.176 blue leather affair_0.206 , lined with white velvet , against which lay a fine gold chain with a small oval locket set around the edge with seed pearls ."
"cb5-fragment02","3424","She gasped in amazement ."
"cb5-fragment02","3425","It was without doubt the most beautiful thing she had ever owned , or ever would ."
"cb5-fragment02","3426","Such delicacy , such refinement_0.344 !"
"cb5-fragment02","3427","Her fingers trembling_0.062 with excitement , she fastened it around her neck ."
"cb5-fragment02","3428","It should remain there for ever ."
"cb5-fragment02","3429","She would never take it off ."
"ccw-fragment03","1561","Ellen and I lingered on in Mama Sipcott 's for another hour and a half_-0.088 ; indulging in the sailor 's shorebound pastime of planning_-0.088 the perfect voyage ."
"ccw-fragment03","1562","We decided that Masquerade would sail from the Bahamas to Panama , and thence to the Galapagos where we would find Darwin 's giant tortoises ."
"ccw-fragment03","1563","Then we would sail south to Easter Island to explore the mysterious statues before going to the mutineers ' refuge on Pitcairn Island ."
"ccw-fragment03","1564","After that we would go to Tahiti , and I saw the excitement grow_0.03 in Ellen as she realised that these plans_0.029 were so close_-0.265 to coming_-0.324 true ."
"ccw-fragment03","1565","It was an excitement that matched_-0.097 my own , for I had never sailed the South Seas and I had long dreamed_0.059 of that scatter_0.333 of tiny , magically_0.278 named islands strewn_0.588 across one third of a globe ."
"ccw-fragment03","1566","By the time we had drunk our third bottle of wine Ellen and I had long reached_0.03 New Zealand and were already sailing north towards New Caledonia ."
"ccw-fragment03","1567","We were happy ."
"ccw-fragment03","1568","We caught_-0.188 the bus back to Ellen 's apartment and collected her clothes and notebooks ."
"ccw-fragment03","1569","She was moving back on board Wavebreaker in preparation for the next day 's early departure ."
"ccw-fragment03","1570","I carried her luggage to the yard , noting_-0.031 that even Ellen 's strident_0.194 feminism evaporated_0.4 in the face_-0.147 of two heavy bags and tropical heat ."
"ccw-fragment03","1571","Once in the boatyard Ellen ran ahead of me , evidently eager to reach Wavebreaker 's air conditioning ."
"ccw-fragment03","1572","Then , as she reached the dock 's edge , she suddenly checked ."
"ccw-fragment03","1573","‘ What on earth is that ?"
"ccw-fragment03","1574","Oh , no ! ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1575","She began to run again ."
"ccw-fragment03","1576","When I reached the water 's edge I understood her dismay ."
"ccw-fragment03","1577","A large sports-fishing boat was moored alongside Wavebreaker , but moored so crudely_0.694 that whoever had brought the powerboat alongside the schooner had not bothered to put out fenders , but instead had gouged long ugly gashes in Wavebreaker 's white paint ."
"ccw-fragment03","1578","Yet even the gashes were not so ugly as the expensive boat that had caused them ."
"ccw-fragment03","1579","There was nothing wrong with the boat 's lines , which were sleekly_0.559 functional , but her long powerful_0.061 hull , her upperworks , and even the interior of her capacious working deck had all been painted with a wartime dazzle paint ."
"ccw-fragment03","1580","The seemingly random and jagged-edged pattern of blue , black , silver , green and white had been designed to disguise_0.303 a boat 's shape from the prying_0.588 eyes of U-Boat captains , so it seemed somewhat fanciful to thus camouflage a pleasure boat in the Bahamas ."
"ccw-fragment03","1581","This boat was called_-0.29 Dream Baby_0.152 , and she was clearly an expensive infant_0.303 for rods and whip-aerials_0.543 and outriggers splayed_0.057 from her upperworks like the antennae_0.429 of some outlandish_0.361 insect_0.125 ."
"ccw-fragment03","1582","She boasted_0.229 a harpoon walkway , a flybridge_-0.088 , and , above the highest wheel-platform , an aluminium canopy_0.333 which held_-0.094 a radar aerial ."
"ccw-fragment03","1583","The fighting chair on her aft deck had thick white leather straps giving_-0.212 it the appearance_0.088 of a padded_0.121 electric_0.091 chair_-0.03 , while the dazzle paint gave_-0.257 the boat an oddly military look that was completed by the number 666 that was painted on her bows_0.062 in silver-edged black numerals like those warships use_-0.343 to display their commissioning numbers ."
"ccw-fragment03","1584","The boat 's wrap-around_0.471 windscreens were made of black polarised glass which only added_0.088 to Dream Baby 's ugly_-0.273 air_0.152 of menace ."
"ccw-fragment03","1585","Ellen , unencumbered with luggage , had already reached Wavebreaker and taken two plastic fenders from a locker ."
"ccw-fragment03","1586","She swung lithely down to Dream Baby 's gaudily painted deck and cushioned the two hulls ."
"ccw-fragment03","1587","‘ How bad is the damage ? ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1588","I called down to her when I reached Wavebreaker ."
"ccw-fragment03","1589","‘ It 's scraped back to bare_0.143 metal ! ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1590","‘ I 'll give_-0.371 it some paint . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1591","Wavebreaker 's hull was made of steel and , while such hulls are marvellously strong_0.182 and safe , they are soon weakened_0.094 if their steel is exposed to salt air ."
"ccw-fragment03","1592","I had to paint the gashes as soon as possible so that rust would not begin to bite_0.219 into Wavebreaker 's long sleekness_0.469 ."
"ccw-fragment03","1593","Ellen looked around the oddly painted powerboat ."
"ccw-fragment03","1594","‘ You 'd think someone rich enough to own a rig like this could afford a pair of fenders . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1595","‘ Who cares ?"
"ccw-fragment03","1596","Just cut the damn boat loose , ’ I said vengefully ."
"ccw-fragment03","1597","Ellen ignored my advice while I , obedient to the rule_0.161 that if a job needed doing then do it without delay , found a pot of white paint and dug_-0.212 through the locker for a clean brush ."
"ccw-fragment03","1598","Then , from behind me , an unfamiliar voice sounded : ‘ Oh , ring_0.265 my bells_0.147 . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1599","It was a man 's voice ; drawling and lazy_0.371 ."
"ccw-fragment03","1600","I twisted around and almost blinded myself by staring straight into the sun , but then , through the dizzying glare , I made out the long silhouette of a tall man who seemed , incongruously , to be dressed in a long , transparent dressing gown ."
"ccw-fragment03","1601","He was emerging in stately fashion from Wavebreaker 's companionway_0.206 and , though I could see he was tall and lanky and had a ponytail of hair , I could make out no details of his face ."
"ccw-fragment03","1602","‘ Who the hell_-0.265 are you ? ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1603","I demanded ."
"ccw-fragment03","1604","The man ignored me , walking instead towards Ellen who , dressed only in shorts and T-shirt , was climbing long-legged over Wavebreaker 's rail ."
"ccw-fragment03","1605","‘ Be still_-0.147 my restless_0.061 heart , ’ the man had a strong_-0.242 , caressing_0.29 voice and the slow_0 luscious_0.353 accent of America 's deep_-0.265 south ."
"ccw-fragment03","1606","‘ Dear lady , dear lady , to think that I might have lived my whole_-0.452 life through and never seen you ."
"ccw-fragment03","1607","Oh , lay me down , just lay me down . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1608","Ellen , usually so quick with a scornful reply , just stood and stared at the elegant stranger who stopped one pace away from her , took her hand , then bowed above her fingers ."
"ccw-fragment03","1609","He kissed the air a fastidiously polite inch above her knuckles , then closed his eyes ."
"ccw-fragment03","1610","‘ Dear sweet Lord_0.03 above , I do thank Thee for Thy kindness in showing me this lovely woman before I died . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1611","To my astonishment and chagrin Ellen left her hand in his as he opened his eyes and smiled at her ."
"ccw-fragment03","1612","‘ My name , ’ he stroked_0.324 her with his voice , ‘ is Jesse Isambard Sweetman ."
"ccw-fragment03","1613","And who , dear creature , are you ? ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1614","Ellen still said nothing ."
"ccw-fragment03","1615","I had straightened up and moved aside so that the sun no longer dazzled me and I could see Sweetman properly , and what I saw I did not like ."
"ccw-fragment03","1616","His face was old_-0.121 and young_0.067 , sardonic and knowing , amused_0.143 and handsome ; the face of a man who has seen the world 's wickedness_0.333 and knows how to match_-0.03 it with his own ."
"ccw-fragment03","1617","His long black hair was tied into its ponytail with a velvet ribbon , his skin was parchment_0.559 pale , and his eyes dark_0.061 ."
"ccw-fragment03","1618","I put_-0.429 his age at forty , but even among men twenty years younger he would have been accounted handsome , and he knew it , for his expression showed_-0.581 both confidence and amusement as he continued to hold Ellen 's hand , and he showed_-0.156 even more amusement when she suddenly realised just what liberty_0.457 she was thus granting him and jerked her fingers swiftly away ."
"ccw-fragment03","1619","Thus released , Jesse Sweetman turned to look at me ."
"ccw-fragment03","1620","The dressing gown had proved to be a long , stylish , ankle-length duster coat which was loosely woven from a delicate white cotton ."
"ccw-fragment03","1621","Beneath the filmy topcoat he wore a black shirt and black trousers that were tucked into tall black boots ."
"ccw-fragment03","1622","It was a dramatic_0.212 and impractical outfit of a kind I only expected to see on the male models_-0.219 who posed in the more outlandish fashion magazines that our rich clients brought aboard Wavebreaker , yet Jesse Isambard Sweetman managed to wear the elaborate style with an elegant_0.394 insouciance ."
"ccw-fragment03","1623","The only incongruous note_-0.088 was a cheap round badge , enamelled in red and yellow , that he wore on his shirt , which bore_0.207 the legend ‘ Just Say No ! ’ ."
"ccw-fragment03","1624","‘ You must be Nicholas Breakspear , ’ he said carelessly , as though he did not much care whether I was or not ."
"ccw-fragment03","1625","‘ Is that gaudy piece of junk your boat ? ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1626","I gestured to where Dream Baby 's aerials showed above Wavebreaker 's gunwale ."
"ccw-fragment03","1627","Sweetman turned and pretended to notice the sports-fishing boat for the first time ."
"ccw-fragment03","1628","‘ No , ’ he said helpfully , then bestowed_0.5 a patronising smile on me ."
"ccw-fragment03","1629","‘ You look so like your father ."
"ccw-fragment03","1630","It 's really uncanny . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1631","‘ Did you bring that boat here ? ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1632","I persevered ."
"ccw-fragment03","1633","‘ Oh , indeed I did , ’ he said brightly_0.086 , as though he merely indulged a rather dim_0.412 child 's curiosity ."
"ccw-fragment03","1634","‘ Your mother was Malise Fielding , am I right ?"
"ccw-fragment03","1635","Or are you Lucy de Sills ’ son ? ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1636","‘ Why the hell_0.029 did n't you use fenders when you tied alongside ? ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1637","He sighed , intimating what a bore I was being ."
"ccw-fragment03","1638","‘ I did not use fenders , Breakspear , because I despise precautions ."
"ccw-fragment03","1639","Precautions are the symptoms_0.059 of small_0.061 and fearful_-0.032 minds ."
"ccw-fragment03","1640","Precautions will not conquer_0.226 empires , they will not build_-0.156 great cities , they will not transmute_0.333 dreams into gold or carry_-0.118 men across wide oceans , and precautions will not , emphatically not , win_-0.129 fair ladies , ’ and here he turned to Ellen and lasciviously dropped_-0.03 his gaze to her long bare legs ."
"ccw-fragment03","1641","Ellen twisted away and Sweetman laughed at her obvious discomfiture , then , as coolly as though he owned Wavebreaker , he stepped down into the central cockpit where he first brushed_0.121 at , then sat on , one of the white cushioned seats by the ship 's wheel ."
"ccw-fragment03","1642","‘ I 've had a look round the boat , ’ he said very coolly , ‘ and I approve of her ."
"ccw-fragment03","1643","So tell me the cost of a week 's charter . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1644","‘ The man you want to see , ’ I said , ‘ is called Matthew McIllvanney and his office is the pink building with the outside staircase ."
"ccw-fragment03","1645","He 's not here this afternoon , but you can doubtless telephone him next week . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1646","Sweetman took a pair of polarised sunglasses from his shirt pocket and put them on before inspecting me again ."
"ccw-fragment03","1647","He did not seem to like what he saw ."
"ccw-fragment03","1648","‘ You 're really not being noticeably helpful , ’ he said after a pause , ‘ so let us try again shall we ?"
"ccw-fragment03","1649","Would you please tell me the high_0.229 season price for one week ? ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1650","‘ How many passengers ? ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1651","Ellen asked before I could refuse to answer ."
"ccw-fragment03","1652","Sweetman paused again , this time to light a long pale_0.182 blue cigarette with a slim_-0.029 gold lighter ."
"ccw-fragment03","1653","He shrugged ."
"ccw-fragment03","1654","‘ Two , four , six passengers ?"
"ccw-fragment03","1655","Does it really matter ? ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1656","‘ One week in high_0.176 season costs ten thousand US dollars for two people , and every extra couple is another thousand bucks . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1657","Ellen 's voice was cold_-0.029 , as though she disliked satisfying his curiosity ."
"ccw-fragment03","1658","‘ And to those prices you have to add_-0.147 the boat 's running costs . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1659","‘ Which are ? ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1660","Sweetman asked carelessly ."
"ccw-fragment03","1661","‘ A lot_-0.265 . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1662","Ellen said flatly ."
"ccw-fragment03","1663","‘ You 're talking fuel , food and liquor , plus any toys you might want aboard like scuba equipment , snorkels , jet-skis or sailboards . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1664","Sweetman drew_0.212 on his fancy cigarette , then blew a plume_0.412 of smoke into Wavebreaker 's rigging before smiling lazily at Ellen ."
"ccw-fragment03","1665","‘ And tell me , sweet_0.091 creature , do you count_-0.152 as a toy_0.061 ?"
"ccw-fragment03","1666","Or are you a part_-0.412 of the initial ten thousand dollars ? ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1667","‘ Get off the boat , ’ I said ."
"ccw-fragment03","1668","‘ Shut up . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1669","He turned_0.206 on me like a snake_0.206 ."
"ccw-fragment03","1670","‘ You 're nothing but a hired hand , Breakspear , so shut the fuck up . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1671","He glanced at the paint pot and brush that I was still holding ."
"ccw-fragment03","1672","‘ Go and paint something ."
"ccw-fragment03","1673","Be useful . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1674","He stared into my eyes , challenging me to defy him , and when I did not move he looked back to Ellen ."
"ccw-fragment03","1675","‘ I asked you a question , dear heart_-0.03 ."
"ccw-fragment03","1676","Please be so good as to answer . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1677","‘ Get off this boat , ’ I told him , but my anger only amused Sweetman who unfolded his long thin legs from the cushioned thwart ."
"ccw-fragment03","1678","‘ Dick off , ’ he said to me ."
"ccw-fragment03","1679","I was surprised that he so eagerly sought to confront_-0.03 me ."
"ccw-fragment03","1680","I am not a small man , nor am I a weakling , yet the thin Sweetman seemed unconcerned as I jumped down into the cockpit_-0.029 ."
"ccw-fragment03","1681","Then I saw why he was so confident ."
"ccw-fragment03","1682","He put a hand into a pocket of his elegant duster coat and brought out a small .22 pistol that he pointed at my face ."
"ccw-fragment03","1683","‘ A ladies ’ gun , ’ he said , ‘ but remarkably effective at close range . ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1684","‘ Nick ! ’"
"ccw-fragment03","1685","Ellen called warningly , as though I might not have seen the gun ."
"ccw-fragment03","1686","The gun 's threat_-0.029 had not stopped my advance ."
"ccw-fragment03","1687","I was calling_-0.059 Sweetman 's bluff , confident he would not dare pull the trigger , and equally confident that my marine training would let me turn_-0.125 him into mincemeat_0.406 ."
"ccw-fragment03","1688","I was also half drunk , and thus filled_-0.061 with the Dutch courage offered_0.235 by Mama Sipcott 's worst white wine ."
"ccw-fragment03","1689","Sweetman stood ."
"ccw-fragment03","1690","There was , at last , a look of alarm on his face , and I could see him wondering whether he really would have to pull the small trigger ."
"ccw-fragment03","1691","He held the gun pointed at my eyes ."
"ccw-fragment04","1991","We beat_0.147 southwards all that first day , slicing_0.343 through a glittering sea , and propelled by an apparently changeless south-easterly trade wind ."
"ccw-fragment04","1992","We hardly saw the Crowninshield twins ."
"ccw-fragment04","1993","They briefly appeared on deck for lunch ; a meal which Rickie hardly touched , while Robin-Anne , despite her apparent frailty , attacked_0.242 the sandwiches and salad with the savagery_0.375 of a starving_0.2 bear_-0.094 ."
"ccw-fragment04","1994","Afterwards , incongruously dressed in a raincoat , she went to the bows_0.29 and stared briefly down at the mesmerising onrush of sea where it split_0 and foamed at Wavebreaker 's cutwater ."
"ccw-fragment04","1995","She did not stay there long , but retreated_0.324 from the fierce_0.212 sun to the stern-cabin that she would be sharing with Ellen ."
"ccw-fragment04","1996","The contrast between the two American girls was almost painful_0.118 ; Ellen was so healthy and strong , while the waif-like Robin-Anne was pathetically wan and listless ."
"ccw-fragment04","1997","‘ What do you think of her ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","1998","I asked Ellen that afternoon ."
"ccw-fragment04","1999","Ellen gave_-0.441 me an amused_0.375 glance ."
"ccw-fragment04","2000","‘ Little Orphan Annie ?"
"ccw-fragment04","2001","It 's hard_-0.344 to believe she 's about to be worth six million dollars ."
"ccw-fragment04","2002","Still , she 's got precious little else going_-0.176 for her . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2003","I smiled at the severity of Ellen 's judgment ."
"ccw-fragment04","2004","‘ Is she that_-0.438 bad ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2005","‘ She has a distressingly simple mind , with only room_-0.355 for a single idea at any one time ."
"ccw-fragment04","2006","Presently that idea is cocaine , and nothing but cocaine ."
"ccw-fragment04","2007","She has an obsession with the drug that verges_0.265 on monomania ."
"ccw-fragment04","2008","She tells me she needs to understand it if she 's going to defeat_-0.032 it . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2009","‘ Do n't you approve of that ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2010","‘ I think she 'd do better to understand herself , ’ Ellen said tartly_0.618 ."
"ccw-fragment04","2011","‘ She allowed a man to persuade her into taking the drug , so she can only blame herself for her predicament ."
"ccw-fragment04","2012","She 'd find_-0.097 it more useful to understand her own character short­comings than to take_-0.364 an elementary course_-0.235 in drug chemistry . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2013","‘ What do you make_-0.469 of Rickie ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2014","I asked ."
"ccw-fragment04","2015","‘ He 's precisely what anyone would expect of a drop-out Phys Ed basketball-playing retard , ’ Ellen said scornfully , ‘ by which I mean that he 's a jock with the brains of a dung_0.312 beetle_0.424 ."
"ccw-fragment04","2016","He reminds me of your Neanderthal_0.469 friend , the Maggot_0.441 , except Rickie is a great deal more handsome . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2017","‘ Is he ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2018","She laughed at the suspicion of jealousy in my voice ."
"ccw-fragment04","2019","‘ Yes , Nicholas , he is ."
"ccw-fragment04","2020","But he 's not cute . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2021","At supper , as at lunch , Robin-Anne ate with the appetite of a horse_0.091 , though her brother hardly touched his chicken and pasta salad ."
"ccw-fragment04","2022","‘ Do n't you like pasta ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2023","Ellen , who was perversely proud of her skills in the salad department_0.031 , asked Rickie with just a touch_0.152 of asperity ."
"ccw-fragment04","2024","‘ It 's great_-0.286 ."
"ccw-fragment04","2025","Really awesome . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2026","Rickie lit a cigarette ."
"ccw-fragment04","2027","‘ I just guess I 'm not hungry . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2028","Robin-Anne reached over and tipped her brother 's food on to her own plate ."
"ccw-fragment04","2029","‘ Kind of starving_0.161 , ’ she justified her theft_0.125 , then poured herself some diet soda ."
"ccw-fragment04","2030","For once we were carrying neither wine nor spirits_0.312 on Wavebreaker , for Jackson Chatterton 's drug clinic had utterly forbidden_0.343 us to offer the twins any alcohol , saying that any mood-altering drug could hamper_0.455 the success_-0.088 of a detoxification programme ."
"ccw-fragment04","2031","We were thus officially a dry_0.206 boat , though I had hidden some Irish whiskey in the engine room , and I was sure that Ellen would have similarly salted away some vodka ."
"ccw-fragment04","2032","It seemed that Ellen and I were not the only ones to take_-0.455 such a precaution , for late that night Jackson Chatterton lumbered on deck with a bottle in one huge hand ."
"ccw-fragment04","2033","‘ Bourbon , ’ he explained laconically ."
"ccw-fragment04","2034","‘ Want some ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2035","‘ I thought you 'd never ask . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2036","He chuckled , produced_0.2 two cardboard cups , and poured me a generous_0 slug_0.382 of the whiskey ."
"ccw-fragment04","2037","We were alone on deck , though not the only ones awake for I could hear Rickie and Ellen 's voices coming_-0.343 from the open skylight of the main saloon ."
"ccw-fragment04","2038","I hoped Thessy was fast asleep for he would be taking_-0.152 the morning watch ."
"ccw-fragment04","2039","‘ Cheers , ’ I said ."
"ccw-fragment04","2040","Chatterton raised his cardboard cup in silent acknowledgement , then stared ahead to where a great beam_0.091 swept_0.345 around the sky ."
"ccw-fragment04","2041","‘ A lighthouse ? ’ he asked in a voice which suggested_0.324 that a prudent man avoided such things ."
"ccw-fragment04","2042","I nodded ."
"ccw-fragment04","2043","‘ It 's called the Hole in the Wall ."
"ccw-fragment04","2044","Once we 're past it we can turn out to the open ocean ."
"ccw-fragment04","2045","Things_-0.382 will be a bit livelier then . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2046","‘ Livelier ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2047","‘ We 'll have a bit more sea , kick up some spray . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2048","I had spoken enthusiastically , but Jackson Chatterton seemed unmoved by the prospect_-0.03 ."
"ccw-fragment04","2049","‘ What are your plans_-0.091 ? ’ he asked me ."
"ccw-fragment04","2050","I had nothing particular planned_0.088 , merely an idea that it might be interesting to thrash_0.455 our way out into the open_-0.265 ocean , though , mindful of the danger of tropical storms , I had no intention of going too far from the safe shelter of a Bahamian hurricane hole ."
"ccw-fragment04","2051","But I fancied feeling the long_0.065 hard_-0.121 pressure of ocean waves against our hull and , though we were short-handed , I reckoned_0.065 that a few days out of sight of land would shake_0.103 us all down quickly ."
"ccw-fragment04","2052","I explained all that to Chatterton , but stressed_0.029 that we would run_-0.303 for cover_0.182 at the first sign_-0.294 of trouble ."
"ccw-fragment04","2053","He must have assumed_-0.182 that I meant trouble from the twins , for he suddenly became surprisingly loquacious ."
"ccw-fragment04","2054","‘ They wo n't give_-0.371 you any grief_0.03 in the next few days , ’ he said ."
"ccw-fragment04","2055","‘ Now that they ca n't get_-0.176 hold_-0.265 of cocaine they 'll just crash out . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2056","I grimaced ."
"ccw-fragment04","2057","‘ Does that mean_-0.114 they 'll be seeing green monkeys and blue snakes up the rigging ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2058","Chatterton poured himself more bourbon , then put the bottle within my reach on the binnacle shelf ."
"ccw-fragment04","2059","‘ Coming_0.029 off cocaine is n't like that ."
"ccw-fragment04","2060","At first they 'll just want to do nothing but eat and sleep ."
"ccw-fragment04","2061","It 's the opposite of a cocaine high_-0.281 , you see_-0.5 . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2062","He paused ."
"ccw-fragment04","2063","‘ The difficult bit_0.2 starts two or three days later ."
"ccw-fragment04","2064","That 's when the real hell_0.062 begins . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2065","‘ For all of us ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2066","‘ It wo n't be easy , ‘ he said grimly , and I was suddenly rather glad to have the taciturn Chatterton aboard ."
"ccw-fragment04","2067","The big man had obviously come on deck to warn me what to expect from the twins , and for that I was grateful ."
"ccw-fragment04","2068","‘ I noticed that Rickie was n't eating today , ’ I said , ‘ but Robin-Anne was ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2069","Chatterton nodded ."
"ccw-fragment04","2070","‘ Rickie may have stopped his cocaine a day or two ago , which means_-0.147 he 's probably already over the crash_0.161 period ."
"ccw-fragment04","2071","I promise you one thing_-0.364 ; he 's brought none of it on board ."
"ccw-fragment04","2072","I searched him and his luggage , and he was clean_-0.088 . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2073","The big man thought for a few seconds , then laughed ."
"ccw-fragment04","2074","‘ He 'd better be clean_0.029 !"
"ccw-fragment04","2075","That turkey_0.129 has got_-0.343 one chance of avoiding jail , just one , and that chance is by proving to the judge that he 's cleaned_0.091 up his act_0 ."
"ccw-fragment04","2076","And if he does n't do that , then the man will send Rickie 's plump young ass down to the gang-rape squad_0.129 in the county jail . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2077","Chatterton did not sound unduly worried at that prospect_0.25 ."
"ccw-fragment04","2078","‘ Can we be sure Robin-Anne did n't bring any of the drug aboard ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2079","I asked ."
"ccw-fragment04","2080","‘ She wo n't have done that , ’ Chatterton said with conviction_0 ."
"ccw-fragment04","2081","‘ That girl is serious about giving it up , real serious , heavy_0.469 serious !"
"ccw-fragment04","2082","That girl is really trying !"
"ccw-fragment04","2083","She studies the drug , you know ?"
"ccw-fragment04","2084","Like_-0.559 it was her enemy_0.03 . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2085","Chatterton had spoken with genuine admiration ."
"ccw-fragment04","2086","I glanced up at the sails , down at the compass , then ahead to where the lighthouse loom_0.303 arced powerfully through the night ."
"ccw-fragment04","2087","‘ So what are the twins , chances ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2088","‘ Depends on their will power , 'cause nothing else will do it for them ."
"ccw-fragment04","2089","There ai n't no pill to get_-0.314 you off the powder , Mr Breakspear , only will power ."
"ccw-fragment04","2090","And let me tell you , coming_-0.059 off coke is the hardest_0 damn thing_-0.235 in the world , and you 're real lucky if you have a rich daddy who pays for people to hold_-0.032 your hand_-0.094 while you go_-0.548 through the hell_0.094 of it ."
"ccw-fragment04","2091","The twins ’ daddy has paid for you and me , Mr Breakspear , and for everyone else on board this boat , but even with all that money and all this boat , we still might not succeed with them . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2092","‘ It 's that hard_-0.457 ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2093","‘ It is that hard_-0.265 , ’ he said ominously , and I thought of John Maggovertski 's sadness for a pretty girl who had whored herself to pay for the white powder ."
"ccw-fragment04","2094","‘ And it 's even harder_0.029 , ’ Jackson Chatterton 's voice was suddenly sinister , ‘ for a poor person who has no one to help them . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2095","I stared at Jackson Chatterton , and at last sensed the drama_0.059 that lay_-0.171 behind his big_-0.303 calm_-0.258 presence ."
"ccw-fragment04","2096","‘ Why did you leave the army , Mr Chatterton ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2097","I asked after a long_-0.156 pause ."
"ccw-fragment04","2098","‘ I guess you can guess , ’ he said ."
"ccw-fragment04","2099","I guessed , but did not make_-0.333 him confirm my guess ."
"ccw-fragment04","2100","Instead I"
"ccw-fragment04","2101","asked whether the American army had helped_-0.094 him to kick_-0.212 his drug habit_0 ."
"ccw-fragment04","2102","‘ Sure they tried , they tried real hard_-0.152 , but back then I did n't"
"ccw-fragment04","2103","want to be helped . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2104","‘ But you still got_-0.5 off cocaine ?"
"ccw-fragment04","2105","On your own ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2106","‘ Eventually . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2107","The light inside the binnacle glossed_0.257 his black"
"ccw-fragment04","2108","face with a sheen of red , sparking_0.125 his eyes like fire ."
"ccw-fragment04","2109","He was not looking at me , but staring doggedly ahead into the turning_-0.061 white light of the Hole in the Wall ."
"ccw-fragment04","2110","‘ And I had to lose_-0.267 a good , good woman before I came_-0.303 to my senses ."
"ccw-fragment04","2111","But I did kick_0.1 the drug , Mr Breakspear , and it was probably the hardest_-0.059 damned thing_-0.281 I ever did in all my life ."
"ccw-fragment04","2112","But once I 'd done it , I swore I 'd help others do it . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2113","‘ Even the very rich ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2114","I asked provocatively ."
"ccw-fragment04","2115","‘ The rich trash_0.176 pay the bills , Mr Breakspear , which lets_-0.294 me give_-0.235 my spare_-0.118 time away_0 to the poor trash_0.061 . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2116","I looked at the tough_-0.03 , impressive face ."
"ccw-fragment04","2117","‘ Are the twins trash_0.353 ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2118","He paused before replying , then gave_-0.471 the smallest shake of his head ."
"ccw-fragment04","2119","‘ She 's OK , but him ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2120","This time the pause was almost eloquent , then he gave_-0.062 a richly_0.382 contagious_0.312 laugh ."
"ccw-fragment04","2121","‘ I 'd have liked to have had Rickie Crowninshield in my platoon for just five minutes . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2122","I laughed too ."
"ccw-fragment04","2123","‘ Good to have you aboard . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2124","‘ It ai n't bad being aboard , ’ he said , and held out his hand and , not before_-0.324 time , we shook ."
"ccw-fragment04","2125","By midnight I was alone on deck , and happy to be alone ."
"ccw-fragment04","2126","I like sailing alone at night ."
"ccw-fragment04","2127","I like to watch the phosphorescence curling_0.559 away from the hull and I like to watch the brilliant specks_0.171 of light fade_0.206 in the black deep water far in the ship 's wake ."
"ccw-fragment04","2128","I like to be alone under the careless_0.226 profusion of the stars , and alone on a moon-glossed sea ."
"ccw-fragment04","2129","I like the sounds of a boat sailing at night ."
"ccw-fragment04","2130","The sounds are the same as those of daylight , yet somehow the night magnifies_0.294 and sharpens_0.206 the creak of a yielding_0.147 block , the sigh_0.294 of air over a shroud , the stretching of a sail , the hiss_0.424 of water sliding_0.324 sleek_0.086 against the hull , the curl_0.125 of a quarter-wave falling away , and the thump as a wave strikes the cutwater to be sheared_0.382 into two bright slices_0.455 of whiteness ."
"ccw-fragment04","2131","I like the purposefulness of a boat at night as it slits_0.382 a path_-0.094 across an empty planet ."
"ccw-fragment04","2132","I like the secretiveness_0.438 of a boat in the blackness , when the only thing to dislike is the prospect_0.324 of dawn , which seems like a betrayal_0.514 because , at night , in a boat under sail , it is easy to feel_-0.344 very close_-0.062 to God — for eternity is all around ."
"ccw-fragment04","2133","I tacked the ship shortly after midnight , doing the job by myself and enjoying the work ."
"ccw-fragment04","2134","Ellen was still awake , talking in the stateroom with Rickie , but everyone else seemed asleep ."
"ccw-fragment04","2135","I wished that Ellen and Rickie would go to their beds , for the soft_0.206 mutter of their voices was an intrusion_0.441 on the dark and star-studded_0.543 infinity through which I steered Wavebreaker ."
"cdb-fragment02","355","The picture , very like the one Rufus Fletcher had taken_-0.121 in the summer of 1976 , occupied_0.088 the screen for about_-0.344 fifteen seconds ."
"cdb-fragment02","356","The whole_-0.088 item was allowed_0 no more than four times that in the BBC 's Sunday evening news broadcast at 6.30 ."
"cdb-fragment02","357","The other forty-five seconds were taken up by a policeman talking to a reporter about having nothing to say except that there would be an inquest ."
"cdb-fragment02","358","But Shiva and Lili Manjusri saw the picture and so did Rufus Fletcher ."
"cdb-fragment02","359","Adam Verne-Smith , unwinding_0.323 in Puerto de la Cruz , did not of course see it ."
"cdb-fragment02","360","He did not even see an English newspaper ."
"cdb-fragment02","361","They were expensive to buy and came_-0.485 a day late ."
"cdb-fragment02","362","He did not want to be reminded of home and the only paper he even glanced at was the International Herald Tribune , a copy of which Anne found on the beach ."
"cdb-fragment02","363","His father , at home in Edgware , said to his wife :"
"cdb-fragment02","364","‘ Good God , Wyvis Hall , as I live and breathe . ’"
"cdb-fragment02","365","Beryl Verne-Smith peered , but the picture immediately vanished ."
"cdb-fragment02","366","‘ Yes , I suppose it was . ’"
"cdb-fragment02","367","The policeman talked , the reporter trying to jog_0.176 him into revelations and failing ."
"cdb-fragment02","368","In the background , autumnal trees could be seen and a church on the summit of a low hill ."
"cdb-fragment02","369","Lewis Verne-Smith sat shaking his head , less as a gesture of denial than of a generalized despair at the state of the world ."
"cdb-fragment02","370","It was not that unpleasant memories were evoked , for these were always with him , his existence was inseparable from that old bitterness_0.438 , but that a sight of the house , even the glimpse of a photograph , revived_0.424 the precise feelings he had had — why , it must be getting on for eleven years ago ."
"cdb-fragment02","371","‘ Ten and a half , ’ said his wife ."
"cdb-fragment02","372","‘ I shall have to get in touch with the police ."
"cdb-fragment02","373","No two ways_-0.343 about it , I shall have to get in touch with them . ’"
"cdb-fragment02","374","‘ Not this evening , surely ? ’ said Beryl , who wanted to watch Mastermind ."
"cdb-fragment02","375","Lewis said nothing ."
"cdb-fragment02","376","The room in which they were sitting underwent_0.281 the curious_0.515 shrinking_0.286 process to which it was subject_-0.121 whenever he was reminded of Wyvis Hall or his Uncle Hilbert or even if the county of Suffolk were mentioned ."
"cdb-fragment02","377","Suddenly it grew small and poky ."
"cdb-fragment02","378","The brick side-wall of his neighbour 's house seemed_-0.029 to have moved_0.065 itself four or five feet further towards the dividing fence , so that it loomed offensively ."
"cdb-fragment02","379","Lewis got up and pulled the curtains across with a pettish_0.6 jerk of his hands ."
"cdb-fragment02","380","‘ Should n't you wait until Adam gets back ? ’"
"cdb-fragment02","381","Beryl said ."
"cdb-fragment02","382","‘ Why ?"
"cdb-fragment02","383","What would that be in aid of ? ’"
"cdb-fragment02","384","Beryl meant that Adam had been among the previous owners of Wyvis Hall while her husband had not , but she knew better than to point_-0.176 this out ."
"cdb-fragment02","385","‘ There is no one living knows that lovely place better than 1 . ’"
"cdb-fragment02","386","‘ That 's true_-0.5 . ’"
"cdb-fragment02","387","‘ I sha n't wait till Adam returns , ’ Lewis said in that manner that had once led_-0.029 his daughter to call him the Frog_0.281 Footman_0.25 ,"
"cdb-fragment02","388","‘ but I shall wait until tomorrow . ’"
"cdb-fragment02","389","Men and women do not usually put_-0.375 their baser feelings_0.097 and intentions into words , not even in the deep_0.212 recesses_0.143 of their own minds ."
"cdb-fragment02","390","So Lewis did not say , even to himself , when he was privately_0.226 considering trying to get_-0.273 hold_-0.4 of his son in Tenerife , that he disliked Adam and would have been pleased to spoil his holiday ."
"cdb-fragment02","391","Instead , he rationalized his thoughts and justified_0.061 himself Adam probably — indeed , almost certainly — knew nothing about the find in the pine wood , but Adam had once owned the house and had thus taken on a responsibility ."
"cdb-fragment02","392","He could not shed_0.029 that responsibility just because he had sold the place ."
"cdb-fragment02","393","Lewis would have agreed with Oscar Wilde that our past is what we are ."
"cdb-fragment02","394","We can not rid ourselves of it ."
"cdb-fragment02","395","Therefore it was Adam 's duty to come home and face_-0.258 the music_0.086 , even though this might be no more than a short_-0.062 blast_0.029 on a tin_0.387 whistle_0.143 ."
"cdb-fragment02","396","But he had no precise idea where Adam was and he did not think Adam 's travel agent ( a personal friend of the young Verne-Smiths ) would tell him ."
"cdb-fragment02","397","Some excuse would be made_-0.065 for not telling him ."
"cdb-fragment02","398","Lewis 's bark_0 , anyway , was always worse than his bite_-0.091 ."
"cdb-fragment02","399","He had virtually no bite_0.353 , as he had once overheard Adam say to Bridget , and heard it with helpless_0.294 chagrin ."
"cdb-fragment02","400","‘ A bloody_0.424 good thing_-0.433 or our childhood would have been a misery instead of just a bore . ’"
"cdb-fragment02","401","Lewis walked into his local police station in Edgware on Monday morning ."
"cdb-fragment02","402","They seemed surprised to see him but not astonished ."
"cdb-fragment02","403","The Suffolk police had begun hunting_0.206 up previous owners of Wyvis Hall and they had been alerted that a Verne-Smith lived in their area ."
"cdb-fragment02","404","There were , after all , only two in the London phone directory ."
"cdb-fragment02","405","This might be a bonus ."
"cdb-fragment02","406","He was asked to wait and then shown into a room where a detective sergeant prepared_0.033 to take_-0.333 a statement from him ."
"cdb-fragment02","407","With busy_-0.118 pomposity Lewis dictated it to a typist and would have gone_-0.097 on and on had he not been diplomatically restrained_0.364 ."
"cdb-fragment02","408","‘ Wyvis Hall , Nunes , Suffolk , and the twenty acres of land surrounding it were the property , through his marriage , of my uncle , Hilbert Verne-Smith ."
"cdb-fragment02","409","They came_-0.206 into the possession of my son Hilbert John Adam Verne-Smith under my uncle 's will , bypassing_0.394 myself , though my son was no more than nineteen at the time of my uncle 's death ."
"cdb-fragment02","410","Being an undergraduate at the time , my son naturally never considered_-0.167 actually residing in the house ."
"cdb-fragment02","411","He was in agreement with my suggestion that the property be sold and before he returned to college in the autumn of 1976 , he took_-0.424 my advice and placed_0.031 house and lands in the hands_0.091 of an estate agent ."
"cdb-fragment02","412","‘ Country properties were not selling well at the time ."
"cdb-fragment02","413","£45,000 was the asking price and I was not surprised that the sale , so to speak , hung_0.5 fire_0.061 ."
"cdb-fragment02","414","However , in the spring of 1977 an offer was made_-0.281 , which my son accepted ."
"cdb-fragment02","415","This sale later fell through and it was not until the following_0.097 August that Wyvis Hall was finally sold to a Mr and Mrs Langan for the much improved figure of £51,995 ."
"cdb-fragment02","416","‘ As far_-0.118 as I know , my son 's personal acquaintance with Wyvis Hall was confined_0.333 to my uncle 's lifetime when 1 , my wife and son and daughter frequently stayed with him ."
"cdb-fragment02","417","After my uncle 's death in April 1976 he visited Wyvis Hall on perhaps two , or at the most three , separate_-0.147 occasions simply for the purpose of looking it over and reaching_0 a decision about the disposal of furniture and effects ."
"cdb-fragment02","418","‘ I suppose it is possible that squatters or other vagrants took_-0.25 possession of the house between the time of my uncle 's death and the sale of the property ."
"cdb-fragment02","419","Certainly my son never let it or allowed anyone to occupy it on either a temporary or permanent basis ."
"cdb-fragment02","420","‘ My son is at present on holiday in Tenerife with his wife and daughter ."
"cdb-fragment02","421","I can not say precisely when I expect him to return , though I should suppose in about_-0.324 a week from now . ’"
"cdb-fragment02","422","It was all very small_-0.364 and quiet_-0.057 and low-key ."
"cdb-fragment02","423","The snippet in Rufus 's Monday morning newspaper measured_0.364 just an inch_-0.229 in depth_0.171 ."
"cdb-fragment02","424","It answered_0.121 the question he had asked himself and told_-0.618 him that the bones of a very young child had been found as well as those of a young woman."
"cdb-fragment02","424a","This was not a shock_-0.059 ."
"cdb-fragment02","425","How could it be otherwise , since this was Wyvis Hall and the pine wood and the animal cemetery ?"
"cdb-fragment02","426","To photograph the house for the news last night the cameraman must have stood just where he had stood himself , on the edge of the lawn with his back to the cedar tree ."
"cdb-fragment02","427","A popular ."
"cdb-fragment02","428","mass-produced camera he had used , but quite a good one ."
"cdb-fragment02","429","One thing_-0.281 about Zosie 's pilfering , she never stole rubbish_0.455 ."
"cdb-fragment02","430","He had taken_-0.5 a picture of her after that and one of the animal cemetery ."
"cdb-fragment02","431","‘ Why is the grass always so short up here ? ’"
"cdb-fragment02","432","Adam had asked ."
"cdb-fragment02","433","‘ Rabbits , I expect . ’"
"cdb-fragment02","434","‘ Why ca n't bloody_0.235 rabbits come and eat my lawns ? ’"
"cdb-fragment02","435","Adam always referred to ‘ my lawns ’ , ‘ my house ’ , ‘ my furniture ’ ."
"cdb-fragment02","436","It had got_-0.286 up Rufus 's nose_0.057 a bit , though Adam had a perfect right to do this ."
"cdb-fragment02","437","It was his , all of it , and it went_-0.194 to his head_-0.152 rather ."
"cdb-fragment02","438","Nineteen-year-olds seldom inherit country mansions , after all ."
"cdb-fragment02","439","It must have been some time in August when I took_-0.529 those pictures , Rufus thought , and a couple_-0.029 of weeks later it was all over ."
"cdb-fragment02","440","Coincidentally , as the community and their lives together broke_-0.125 up , so_-0.257 did the weather ."
"cdb-fragment02","441","It was raining intermittently all the time they were in the cemetery , the pines bowing_0.294 and shivering_0.382 in the wind ."
"cdb-fragment02","442","Sometimes they had had to stop and take_-0.273 shelter under the closely planted-trees ."
"cdb-fragment02","443","If the weather had held_0.152 and still been hot and dry would they have dug deeper ?"
"cdb-fragment02","444","Probably not ."
"cdb-fragment02","445","In spite of the rain , the earth was still as_-0.469 hard as iron_0.212 ."
"cdb-fragment02","446","A sheet_0.061 of rain had come down then , a hard_-0.206 , gusty shower_0.387 , while they were laying the squares of turf back in place , and Adam had said something about the rain making_0.226 the grass grow quickly , the rain being on their side_-0.029 ."
"cdb-fragment02","447","‘ We should all go our separate_-0.294 ways as soon as we can , ’ Rufus had said ."
"cdb-fragment02","448","‘ We should pack up now and go . ’"
"cdb-fragment02","449","The spade and the fork they had hung up among the other tools in the stables ."
"cdb-fragment02","450","They had packed and Adam had locked up the house ."
"cdb-fragment02","451","At some point_-0.206 Rufus himself had taken the things out of the fridge and left the door open to defrost it ."
"cdb-fragment02","452","Adam closed the front door and stood there for a moment as if he could not wrench_0.469 himself away ."
"cdb-fragment02","453","So much of its beauty had been stripped_0.219 from it by the whipping_0.485 winds ."
"cdb-fragment02","454","And by the neglect_0.125 of the long_-0.152 hot summer ."
"cdb-fragment02","455","A sudden gust of rain dashed_0.118 against the red bricks that were already stained in patches by water ."
"cdb-fragment02","456","The house that when he first saw it had seemed_-0.147 to float_0.152 on a raft_0.485 of golden_0.333 mist_0.194 , now lay_-0.382 in a wilderness , amidst ragged_0.176 grass and straggling_0.355 bushes and trees dead from the heat ."
"cdb-fragment02","457","Dirty_0.206 grey clouds tumbled_0.343 across the sky above the slate roof , now the only thing that shone_0.636 , glazed_0.515 with rain ."
"cdb-fragment02","458","But Rufus admitted_-0.088 to himself that the beauties of nature and architecture had never meant_-0.206 much to him ."
"cdb-fragment02","459","It was the heat and sunshine and privacy he liked ."
"cdb-fragment02","460","And now he longed only to get away ."
"cdb-fragment02","461","They all got into Goblander and he drove away up the drift , Adam next to him , the others in the back_-0.286 ."
"cdb-fragment02","462","The drift had become a tunnel_0.353 of overgrowth that dripped water on to the roof of the van ."
"cdb-fragment02","463","None of them allowed_-0.152 their eyes to turn_-0.324 towards the pine wood ."
"cdb-fragment02","464","At the top they came out into uncompromising_0.343 , bright grey light , the bleak , hedgeless lane , the flat meadows where here and there stunted trees squatted_0.333 like old_-0.314 men_-0.344 in cloaks_0.353 ."
"cdb-fragment02","465","Adam 's simile , not his , thought Rufus with a grimace ."
"cdb-fragment02","466","No one asked where he was taking them ."
"cdb-fragment02","467","No one spoke ."
"cdb-fragment02","468","Adam had Hilbert 's old golf-bag stuck between his legs and Rufus guessed the gun was inside it ."
"cdb-fragment02","469","They must have gone a good two miles before they met_-0.286 another car ."
"cdb-fragment02","470","Rufus overtook a bus going_-0.5 to Colchester and dropped_-0.029 the two in the back_-0.333 so that they could catch_0.088 it ."
"cdb-fragment02","471","He took Adam on to Sudbury for him to catch_-0.206 a train there and at that point_-0.029 they parted ."
"cdb-fragment02","472","Adam got down from Goblander and said ,"
"cdb-fragment02","473","‘ For ever and for ever , farewell , Rufus . ’"
"cdb-fragment02","474","Which was probably a quotation from something , though Rufus did not know what and thought fastidiously that it was in bad taste_-0.061 , histrionic , though just like Adam ."
"cdb-fragment02","475","‘ Take_-0.25 care , ’ said Rufus , and not looking back any more than he had done when they returned from the cemetery , drove off round the town he had got to know so well , over the Stour bridge , into Essex , heading for Halstead and Dunmow and Ongar and London ."
"cdb-fragment02","476","He never had seen any of them again ."
"cdb-fragment02","477","There had been no need to pretend , to turn aside ."
"cdb-fragment02","478","Briefly , starting his fifth year in medical school something over_-0.121 thirteen months later , he had wondered if Shiva Manjusri would be one of the incoming freshmen ."
"cdb-fragment02","479","But no , his intuition had been accurate_0 ."
"cdb-fragment02","480","At any rate_0.03 Shiva 's face was not among the several brown faces ."
"cdb-fragment02","481","As for the others , avoiding them had presented_0.188 no problems ."
"cdb-fragment02","482","Would they get in touch with him now ?"
"cdb-fragment02","483","No contingency plans_0.031 had been made_-0.588 for this eventuality ."
"cdb-fragment02","484","So long as there was no hunt_-0.029 for a missing girl they had felt_-0.222 themselves reasonably safe_-0.382 ."
"cdb-fragment02","485","Their minds had not reached_0.091 out to the terror of what had in fact happened ."
"cdb-fragment02","486","None of them had been the kind of people who could have imagined devotion_0.182 to a pet animal or according to it funerary rites ."
"cdb-fragment02","487","It was Shiva who had proposed the site ."
"cdb-fragment02","488","They had congratulated him on his ingenuity ."
"cdb-fragment02","489","Ten years …"
"cdb-fragment02","490","An ovarian cyst , nothing to get upset_-0.333 about , Rufus told Ms Beauchamp ."
"cdb-fragment02","491","She was thirty-two , an editor with a distinguished publishing house , married to an investigative journalist ."
"cdb-fragment02","492","As yet they had no children , but she wanted four , she told Rufus ."
"cdb-fragment02","493","‘ No reason why you should n't . ’"
"cdb-fragment02","494","He had another glance at her notes ."
"cdb-fragment02","495","‘ In fact , a peculiarity about this condition is that it seldom if ever occurs in a woman who 's had a baby . ’"
"cdb-fragment02","496","‘ My God , ’ she said , putting her coat on , ."
"cdb-fragment02","497","'and there was 1 , making_-0.371 my husband 's life a misery , sure I 'd got_-0.343 the dreaded C. ’"
"cdb-fragment02","498","They all thought they 'd got_-0.364 the dreaded C , poor_0 things_-0.273 ."
"cdb-fragment02","499","You could n't blame them ."
"cdb-fragment02","500","Rufus took her £40 off her by the reception desk , having set_-0.242 in train_0 the arrangements by which she would be admitted_0.118 to a fashionable West End clinic , with Rufus , her surgery and her hospitalization ultimately paid for by some provident association to which she and her husband subscribed ."
"cdb-fragment02","501","Rufus shook hands ."
"cdb-fragment02","502","He walked back to his consulting room , dying_0.088 for a cigarette ."
"cdb-fragment02","503","This was unlike him ."
"cdb-fragment02","504","He could usually get_-0.486 through quite easily until after lunch ."
"cdb-fragment02","505","He thought , I know what my idea of heaven would be , if by heaven we mean a place of bliss in which to pass_-0.188 eternity : a sanctuary where one might chain-smoke without impairment of breathing , destruction of the lungs or damage to the heart , light each fresh_0.094 cigarette from the glowing butt_0.121 of its predecessor_0.364 , and drink ice-free but hundred-proof chilled vodka laced_0.156 with two drops of angostura and a gill of newly opened Perrier endlessly , with increasing euphoria until a peak_0.278 of joy and ease was reached_-0.031 but without any sub-sequent nausea or pain or dehydration or oblivion …"
"cdb-fragment02","506","Sitting alone , he lit his cigarette , the first of the day , and there came_-0.312 that faint_-0.094 swimming_0.394 in the head , a tautening of the gut ."
"cdb-fragment02","507","He closed his eyes ."
"cdb-fragment02","508","If it comes_-0.281 to light_0.114 that I was in that house with Adam and the others , he thought with cold_0 clarity_0.059 , if someone tells_-0.219 the papers , or the police and thence the papers , that I was there during the summer of 1976 , living there , it will be all up with me ."
"cdb-fragment02","509","I will lose_-0.156 my practice and my reputation and everything that I have and can look_-0.118 forward_-0.118 to , if not my liberty ."
"cdb-fragment02","510","And without the rest I sha n't care about my liberty ."
"cdb-fragment02","511","It would be bad enough if I were a G P or an expert in some other branch_0.121 of medicine , an orthopaedic surgeon , for instance , or an ear , nose and throat man , but I am a gynaecologist , and it is the bones of a young woman and a baby that have been found there …"
"cdb-fragment02","512","What worried woman would come to me ?"
"cdb-fragment02","513","What Mrs Strawson or Ms Beauchamp ?"
"cdb-fragment02","514","What GP would send her to me ?"
"cdb-fragment02","515","If I were innocent , thought Rufus , I know very well what I would do ."
"cdb-fragment02","516","I would pick up the phone and phone my solicitor and ask to come and see him and get_-0.438 his advice ."
"cdb-fragment02","517","He might advise me to make_-0.545 a statement to the police which I should of course do under his guidance_0.176 ."
"cdb-fragment02","518","But I shall not do this because I am not innocent ."
"cdb-fragment02","519","I shall sit here and wait and sweat_0.212 it out and look_-0.242 the facts in the face_-0.059 , trying to anticipate the worst that can happen ."
"cdb-fragment04","855","The wonderful thing_-0.516 about the human mind , Adam thought , is the way_-0.371 it copes_-0.147 when the worst happens ."
"cdb-fragment04","856","Beyond that worst happening you think there can be nothing , the unimaginable has taken_0.061 place_-0.065 , and on the other side_-0.333 is death , destruction , the end_-0.371 ."
"cdb-fragment04","857","But the worst happens and you reel_0.455 from it , you stagger_0.636 , the shock_0.121 is enormous_0.303 , and then you begin to recover_0.065 ."
"cdb-fragment04","858","You rally_0.152 , you stand_-0.303 up and face_-0.206 it ."
"cdb-fragment04","859","You get used to it ."
"cdb-fragment04","860","An hour maybe and you are making_-0.303 contingency plans_-0.25 ."
"cdb-fragment04","861","For what had happened was not the worst , you realized that ."
"cdb-fragment04","862","The worst was yet to come_-0.281 , was perhaps always yet to come_-0.5 , never would actually come_-0.129 , because if it did you would know it , that would be reality , and there would be nothing then but to kill yourself ."
"cdb-fragment04","863","Quickly ."
"cdb-fragment04","864","Now that he was able to , he assembled_0.118 what had happened and laid_0.094 the facts before himself ."
"cdb-fragment04","865","They had dug up those bones at Wyvis Hall and had decided it was murder they were investigating ."
"cdb-fragment04","866","Bones , skeletons , bodies , do not bury themselves ."
"cdb-fragment04","867","Those were the facts , as far_-0.176 as he knew them up to this moment ."
"cdb-fragment04","868","He would know more , much more , in the days to come_-0.031 ."
"cdb-fragment04","869","What was certain was that he could no longer use the escape key ."
"cdb-fragment04","870","It was defunct ."
"cdb-fragment04","871","The passages_0.303 it cancelled had , in any case , as in certain programmes , not been lost_-0.424 but stored_0.03 on some limbo_0.364 disc from whence they must now be retrieved_0.094 ."
"cdb-fragment04","872","Adam sat in his parents ' house , drinking tea ."
"cdb-fragment04","873","There must be a total retrieval_0.176 now , the one good thing_-0.441 about which was that it might banish_0.412 his dreams ."
"cdb-fragment04","874","He was aware of a slight_-0.103 feeling of sickness and of cold , an absence of hunger , though he had been feeling_0.097 quite hungry when he got off the plane ."
"cdb-fragment04","875","Anne sat next to him on his mother 's cretonne-covered settee and Abigail lay on a plaid rug on the floor , kicking with her legs and punching with her arms ."
"cdb-fragment04","876","His mother kept poking toys which she did not want at her ."
"cdb-fragment04","877","A passage_0.03 from a novel by John O'Hara came_-0.212 back to Adam ."
"cdb-fragment04","878","He had memorized it years ago in the Ecalpemos epoch : ‘ The safest way_-0.606 to live is first , inherit money , second , be born without taste_-0.235 for liquor , third , have a legitimate job that keeps you busy , fourth , marry a wife who will cooperate in your sexual peculiarities , fifth , join_-0.03 some big_-0.484 church , sixth , do n't live too long . ’"
"cdb-fragment04","879","Apart from the last one which he had n't got_-0.212 to yet and the penultimate one which seemed to apply in America more than here ( here he had joined_-0.182 the golf club ) he had complied with all the rest ."
"cdb-fragment04","880","Or his nature_0.086 and luck had complied_0.371 for him ."
"cdb-fragment04","881","Nemesis had still come_-0.091 down like the wolf_0.364 on the fold_-0.03 ."
"cdb-fragment04","882","He had not wanted to come back here ."
"cdb-fragment04","883","But there had been no spirit_0 in him , the shock_0.061 of what his father told him had been too great_-0.057 ."
"cdb-fragment04","884","‘ Something that will interest you , Adam , something to make_-0.429 you sit_-0.059 up ."
"cdb-fragment04","885","They 've dug up a lot_-0.333 of human bones at my old uncle 's house … ‘"
"cdb-fragment04","886","By the time he had rallied_0.273 and got_-0.1 himself together_-0.032 and was thinking of things_-0.324 to say to the police it was too late and they were heading north ."
"cdb-fragment04","887","Anne was furious ."
"cdb-fragment04","888","When Lewis said to come back with him and eat there Adam had got_-0.629 a kick on the ankle from Anne and another kick when he had n't replied ."
"cdb-fragment04","889","He had turned_-0.147 on her and said with cold_-0.03 savagery , ‘ For fuck 's sake , stop kicking me , will you ? ’"
"cdb-fragment04","890","He expected his father to rise_0.167 and say something about that being no way_-0.147 to speak to one 's wife or not in front of the child , he was capable of that ."
"cdb-fragment04","891","But he had said nothing , only looked subdued , and Adam realized why ."
"cdb-fragment04","892","His own terrible fear and anger had communicated_0.314 itself to his father and shown_-0.294 him what the better part_-0.412 of valour was : keeping silent ."
"cdb-fragment04","893","Having put_-0.306 the cat_0.286 among the pigeons_0.176 , made_-0.188 mischief in his special way_-0.182 , he was lying_0.182 low_0.091 now and waiting ."
"cdb-fragment04","894","The old bastard_0.125 ."
"cdb-fragment04","895","Adam only wished Uncle Hilbert had left_0.242 him Wyvis Hall and then there would have been no Ecalpemos , no Zosie , and no deaths ."
"cdb-fragment04","896","And Adam could n't see_-0.441 he would have been much worse off ."
"cdb-fragment04","897","He and Anne would be living in a house like this one , rather than that neo-Georgian palace_0.032 ."
"cdb-fragment04","898","Children , after all , he thought , looking at Abigail , were happy wherever they were , so long as they were loved …"
"cdb-fragment04","899","His parents had not asked him what sort of holiday he had had or how the flight had been ."
"cdb-fragment04","900","The conversation was exclusively on the subject_0.057 of the discovery at Wyvis Hall ."
"cdb-fragment04","901","Adam did not know whether to be glad or sorry he had not obtained an English newspaper while away ."
"cdb-fragment04","902","If he had done the shock_0.182 would have been less but on the other hand_-0.2 , his holiday would have been spoilt_0.312 ."
"cdb-fragment04","903","He would have liked very much to be alone ."
"cdb-fragment04","904","Of course he knew there was no possibility of this , now or when he returned home , for when you were married you never could be alone ."
"cdb-fragment04","905","Presumably that was the point_-0.094 ."
"cdb-fragment04","906","What was he going to tell Anne ?"
"cdb-fragment04","907","How much was he going to tell her ?"
"cdb-fragment04","908","He did n't know ."
"cdb-fragment04","909","None of it , if he could help_-0.581 it ."
"cdb-fragment04","910","They sat at the table in the dining area to eat an absurdly early high_0.161 tea ."
"cdb-fragment04","911","Lewis asked him if he could remember the day when he heard he had inherited Wyvis Hall and had walked in here and astounded them with his news ."
"cdb-fragment04","912","‘ He had a beard then , Anne . ’"
"cdb-fragment04","913","Lewis 's subdued_0.5 air_-0.094 had changed_-0.029 to one of high_-0.056 good humour ."
"cdb-fragment04","914","‘ You would n't have recognized him , he looked like John the Baptist_0.394 . ’"
"cdb-fragment04","915","Adam could remember very well but he was n't going_-0.5 to say so ."
"cdb-fragment04","916","‘ What a funny_0.029 thing_-0.412 , ’ said Lewis ."
"cdb-fragment04","917","‘ We had ham salad that day too ."
"cdb-fragment04","918","What a coincidence !"
"cdb-fragment04","919","Oh , yes , I 've been meaning to ask you , who was it looked_0.031 after Wyvis Hall while you were in Greece ? ’"
"cdb-fragment04","920","Adam could eat nothing ."
"cdb-fragment04","921","The other time , he remembered , it was his father who had n't been able to eat ."
"cdb-fragment04","922","He did n't know what Lewis meant about someone looking_-0.182 after the house but no doubt he , Adam , had at the time concocted_0.364 some tale_0.152 to keep_-0.273 his father quiet , to keep_-0.171 him away even ."
"cdb-fragment04","923","‘ Someone from the village , you said , ’ Lewis persisted ."
"cdb-fragment04","924","‘ How can I remember that_-0.559 far_-0.419 back ? ’"
"cdb-fragment04","925","‘ The police will want to know ."
"cdb-fragment04","926","It may be of vital_-0.029 importance . ’"
"cdb-fragment04","927","‘ Are n't you going_-0.706 to eat your meat , dear ? ’ said Beryl ."
"cdb-fragment04","928","Abigail , who had been put upstairs in one of the bedrooms to sleep , set_-0.032 up a wailing sound ."
"cdb-fragment04","929","Adam was on his feet at once ."
"cdb-fragment04","930","‘ I think we should go . ’"
"cdb-fragment04","931","They had to wait until his father was ready ."
"cdb-fragment04","932","Adam would have preferred to phone for a hire car but Lewis would n't hear of it ."
"cdb-fragment04","933","Anne sat in the front in the passenger seat while Adam was in the back_-0.424 with Abigail ."
"cdb-fragment04","934","If his father could have found out what flight they were coming on , the police certainly could ."
"cdb-fragment04","935","It was possible they might be waiting for him ."
"cdb-fragment04","936","They would wish to interview every former owner or occupant of Wyvis Hall ."
"cdb-fragment04","937","He looked again at the newspaper account_0.152 of the adjourned inquest that his father had saved_-0.059 for him ."
"cdb-fragment04","938","It would be owners and occupants of Wyvis Hall between nine and twelve years before that they would wish to interview , and those were Great-Uncle Hilbert , who was dead , himself and Ivan Langan to whom he had sold the house ."
"cdb-fragment04","939","As for other occupants , how would they know who else had lived there_-0.371 ?"
"cdb-fragment04","940","It was ironical that ten days before he had seen Shiva at Heathrow ."
"cdb-fragment04","941","The encounter he now saw_-0.371 as an omen_0.235 , a shadow_0.273 cast_0.455 by a coming event ."
"cdb-fragment04","942","What would that event be ?"
"cdb-fragment04","943","Adam did not want at this point_0 to speculate , it made_-0.242 hi– feel_-0.484 sick_-0.176 ."
"cdb-fragment04","944","He turned the newspaper over so that he could not see that headline and those paragraphs ."
"cdb-fragment04","945","In high_0.125 spirits_0.333 , his father was talking about the immense_0.273 advances_0.059 made_-0.343 in forensic science in recent years ."
"cdb-fragment04","946","As soon as they got home , Anne started getting Abigail to bed ."
"cdb-fragment04","947","Their cases humped upstairs and put into the bedroom , Adam looked Rufus Fletcher up in the phone book ."
"cdb-fragment04","948","He was in there_-0.182 twice , at a Wimpole Street number and again at an address in Mill Hill : Rufus H. Fletcher , MB , MRCP ."
"cdb-fragment04","949","All these years then , or for some of them , Rufus had been living three or four miles from him ."
"cdb-fragment04","950","He could n't look Shiva up because he could n't remember his surname ."
"cdb-fragment04","951","Women marry and change_-0.25 their names , he thought , there was no point_-0.194 in pursuing_0.294 that one ."
"cdb-fragment04","952","Of course he could look up Robin Tatian but where , really , would that get_-0.194 him ?"
"cdb-fragment04","953","He was reaching-for the blue directory when Anne came back with Abigail in her arms , so Adam took her and carried her back to bed himself and tucked her in and kissed her ."
"cdb-fragment04","954","She was almost asleep ."
"cdb-fragment04","955","He wondered if Rufus had children and if so did he worry_-0.314 about them coming_-0.294 to terrible harm the way_-0.152 Adam worried_-0.031 ?"
"cdb-fragment04","956","Was his whole_-0.25 life affected by what had happened at Ecalpemos ?"
"cdb-fragment04","957","Adam might have escaped_0.118 the file memories for years , suppressed_0.531 them and jerked_0.486 violently away from them , but he had never been able to pretend he was unscathed by those events ."
"cdb-fragment04","958","Sometimes he felt_-0.333 that he was the person he was because of them and acted the way_-0.344 he did because of their effects ."
"cdb-fragment04","959","He sat by Abigail 's cot , not wanting to remember , but knowing that now he must ."
"cdb-fragment04","960","There was nothing in his house to remind him of Ecalpemos ."
"cdb-fragment04","961","Everything that was left , everything he and Rufus had n't sold , had gone_-0.129 to Ivan Langan with the house ."
"cdb-fragment04","962","For a song_0.086 , too , because he had not been able to bear_0.065 the thought of going back , meeting a valuer , walking about the house , picking things off shelves and out of cupboards ."
"cdb-fragment04","963","Only once had he returned after they all left and that had been bad enough , like a dream_0.167 — no , like stepping_0.059 into the set_-0.371 and scenario_0.212 of some frightening_0.206 film_0 , a Hitchcock movie_-0.031 perhaps ."
"cdb-fragment04","964","He asked the taxi he had taken_-0.147 to put_-0.242 him down at the top_-0.029 of the drift and he had walked to the house ."
"cdb-fragment04","965","It was almost a year since he had been there and in that time nothing had been done , nothing had been touched ."
"cdb-fragment04","966","From the pine wood he simply averted his eyes — till later ."
"cdb-fragment04","967","The drift was thickly overgrown , a dank tunnel out of whose bushy sides the tendrils of brambles and briar roses caught_0.059 at his clothes ."
"cdb-fragment04","968","One of these whipped_0.471 back at him and as he caught at it a thorn drove_0.235 into the fleshy pad_-0.062 of his finger ."
"cdb-fragment04","969","That thorn had been there , festering , for months ."
"cdb-fragment04","970","A dull_-0.029 cool summer it had been , as different as could be from the year before_-0.182 ."
"cdb-fragment04","971","No golden_0.156 light bathed_0.438 the red brick of the house ."
"cdb-fragment04","972","It no longer looked mellow ."
"cdb-fragment04","973","Beautiful , yes , but severe_0.156 somehow and , to Adam 's heightened awareness , reproachful_0.212 ."
"cdb-fragment04","974","He found_-0.343 himself encouraging_0.029 , fostering_0.4 , the scenario_0.206 illusion ."
"cdb-fragment04","975","Only thus , only by pretending unreality , pretending this was a part_-0.176 he acted , could he go on , cross the wild , shaggy_0.412 grass , go past the black-branched cedar tree , arrive at the porch set in its four Doric columns and insert his key in the lock ."
"clp-fragment01","744","Conclusion"
"clp-fragment01","745","Task analysis has not and can not be reduced_0.067 to a set of standardised procedures which the aspiring analyst could acquire_-0.031 in a formal_-0.088 training_-0.031 course_0 ."
"clp-fragment01","746","The techniques just described are no more than guidelines in what remains the creative_-0.194 art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do ."
"clp-fragment01","747","The danger in being too rigid_0.212 is that justice will not be done to the flexibility_0.061 and complexity of human performance ."
"clp-fragment01","748","The danger of being too flexible_0.061 is that the ergonomists will have an inadequate basis from which to design_0.03 interfaces , training_-0.118 courses_-0.032 and other operator aids ."
"clp-fragment01","749","If a comprehensive task description can be completed then it is legitimate to enquire why the task can not be allocated to a technical device rather than a human being ."
"clp-fragment01","750","Yet without a reasonably comprehensive task description the total system performance_0.242 may be unreliable or unpredictable ."
"clp-fragment01","751","There is a necessary compromise which can only be arrived_0 at in the context_-0.118 of a particular system ."
"clp-fragment01","752","As mentioned_0.1 earlier there are always the twin_-0.091 problems of how to get_-0.529 the information and how to present_-0.029 it ."
"clp-fragment01","753","It is sometimes easier to proceed_0 on the basis of : ‘ If I were doing the job this is how I would do it ’ , but this can be delusory even for analysts who have past experience as operators ."
"clp-fragment01","754","For analysts who are designers creating_-0.206 a new task there may be no alternative , but any task description arrived_0 at by this method should be checked against the behaviour of real operators as they gain_0 experience ."
"clp-fragment01","755","A particular difficulty about task synthesis_0.212 is that there is no easy way_-0.469 of confirming completeness ."
"clp-fragment01","756","A task description which is part_-0.387 of a design_-0.118 process should be fully — documented in terms of the origins_0 of information , the assumptions made_-0.242 and the methods used ."
"clp-fragment01","757","The standard method of producing_0.129 task descriptions is to write all the separate sub-tasks at various levels_0.059 on cards and then assemble_0.182 the cards in a network_-0.156 ."
"clp-fragment01","758","There is a temptation to make these final diagrams very large , but often it is more useful to separate_0.161 into small_-0.206 units_-0.029 with cross-referencing ."
"clp-fragment01","759","The optimum size seems to be A3 , this is easily copied and circulated_0.324 but is large enough to contain_-0.25 considerable detail ."
"clp-fragment01","760","The procedure can be computerised , there are programmes available for the easy production_0.118 , manipulation_0.344 and storage_0.086 of block_0.206 diagrams with useful cross-referencing facilities_0.182 ."
"clp-fragment01","761","There is an inherent difficulty in that often the main dividend from a task analysis is from the act of obtaining it ."
"clp-fragment01","762","Those not involved find_-0.176 it difficult to gain_-0.143 very much from a presentation of a task description ."
"clp-fragment01","763","Like reference books , they have to be used rather than read ."
"clp-fragment01","764","Task analysis can be very expensive in skilled manpower , but in looking_0.032 at cost/value it is important to include_-0.176 in value the increase in mutual understanding which occurs when a multi-disciplinary team conducts_0.03 the analysis ."
"clp-fragment01","765","If such a team is used the required man-hours can be optimised by using the Delphi method rather than a long_-0.364 series of group meetings ."
"clp-fragment01","766","Political , economic and social issues which arise_-0.091 in conducting_0.265 Task Analyses are discussed_0.394 in the context_0.03 of Job Analysis ( p. 148 ) ."
"clp-fragment01","767","Application_0.206"
"clp-fragment01","768","Man-power planning"
"clp-fragment01","769","The ‘ Human Resource_0.229 ’ concept of man-power as the central_0.03 profit­generating_0.515 asset_0.029 of any organisation has made_-0.618 some progress_0.03 over the past twenty years ."
"clp-fragment01","770","There was particular interest around_-0.121 1970 when companies were prosperous , stable_-0.059 and innovative ( IPM , 1972 , Patten , 1971 ) ."
"clp-fragment01","771","The objective is to revise and almost reverse_-0.062 the traditional accountancy concept of man-power as a resource_0 consuming_-0.031 factor requiring regular payments , overheads in the form_-0.176 of heated , lighted , equipped workspaces and so on ."
"clp-fragment01","772","From the narrow_0.118 accountancy viewpoint_0.091 , people are a cost and it is desirable_0 to keep_-0.514 this cost as low_-0.286 as possible ."
"clp-fragment01","773","In these terms it is very difficult to justify , for example , sending a member_-0.265 of staff on a training_-0.171 course_-0.206 ."
"clp-fragment01","774","The training_0.059 requires expenditure and so also does the replacement for the person away ."
"clp-fragment01","775","Where is the return_0.031 ?"
"clp-fragment01","776","The return_-0.121 is actually in the improved human resource_0.121 but this is not readily measurable in terms which accountants use ."
"clp-fragment01","777","There have been two attempts to reduce_-0.182 human resources_-0.094 to this form_-0.156 of measurement_0.143 ( Giles and Robinson , 1972 ) ."
"clp-fragment01","778","One is to acquire_0.394 a human asset_-0.065 multiplier for each level_-0.029 of staff ."
"clp-fragment01","779","The multiplier for manual staff might be unity but it increases with staff level_0 and becomes three or more for management ."
"clp-fragment01","780","The other is to add together_-0.171 all the personnel costs for each kind of worker from the original job advertisement through to the retirement or redundancy payments ."
"clp-fragment01","781","The first does attempt_-0.086 to obtain_-0.065 a value , the second remains essentially a cost and not a value ."
"clp-fragment01","782","It would be unduly optimistic to assume_0.212 that management skills have risen_-0.062 to a level_-0.088 such that costs undertaken_0.485 can be assumed_-0.031 to be equivalent to value ."
"clp-fragment01","783","A less direct_-0.094 measure_-0.118 which is applicable only to the most senior_-0.212 management is to observe the fall_0 or rise_-0.167 of the share price when a particular executive leaves_-0.171 or joins_-0.031 a company ."
"clp-fragment01","784","This can be very high_-0.219 , for a large_-0.219 company a change in market_-0.029 value of millions of pounds is not unusual ."
"clp-fragment01","785","The most serious_-0.273 consequence of the accountancy view_-0.371 of man-power is that high_-0.206 level_-0.273 policy decision-making does not give_-0.455 this factor sufficient weight_0.065 ."
"clp-fragment01","786","For example , the main board of a company will have complete details of cost and values of physical resources_0.061 such as buildings and equipment but relatively scanty_0.059 data about the man-power which is their most important asset_-0.088 ."
"clp-fragment01","787","Indeed it will be described_0 almost entirely as a liability because the costs will be known ."
"clp-fragment01","788","Similarly , broad_0.226 factors such as the state_0 of morale will again only be described by negative_0.059 features_0.029 such as absenteeism , stoppages , strikes_0.176 , low_-0.343 quality output and so on ."
"clp-fragment01","789","It is obvious that company output and projects must reflect_0.088 the man-power and its performance_0.03 level_-0.188 , but , if this is acknowledged at all , it is only in brief_-0.029 verbal terms within_-0.3 , for example , the chairman 's annual report ."
"clp-fragment01","790","The obsession , of current management , with measurement and the reduction_0.206 of every variable to numbers for ease of computer manipulation_0.121 has worsened the situation_0.143 ."
"clp-fragment01","791","Unfortunately there is no easy remedy_0.226 ."
"clp-fragment01","792","Human resources_0.088 are too complex a variable to be easily susceptible_0.441 to measurement beyond the level_-0.059 of counting heads and trades ."
"clp-fragment01","793","Key variables such as the quality of staff at any level_-0.088 and the current morale are only expressible_0.455 in general verbal descriptive terms ."
"clp-fragment01","794","It is generally accepted ( p. 145 ) that ‘ hygiene ’ type variables such as pay and working conditions can , if they are inappropriately specified , depress_0.382 morale and motivation but they will not in themselves result in very high_-0.194 levels_-0.152 of these parameters ."
"clp-fragment01","795","Morale and motivation are influenced more by conditions of work in the sense of work variety opportunities and attitudes_0.229 of management ."
"clp-fragment01","796","These factors are worthy of emphasis_0.194 because in practice they are still dealt_-0.029 with very badly in many organisations and yet it takes_-0.286 little trouble or expertise to make_-0.281 an enormous difference ."
"clp-fragment01","797","for example , very few senior_0.226 managements take_-0.312 the trouble to keep_-0.438 workers fully informed about policies and likely changes ."
"clp-fragment01","798","The result is excessive reliance on rumour and continuous_0.25 speculation which is not only time-consuming but is also highly deleterious in morale terms ."
"clp-fragment01","799","The two human factors which can be unambiguously measured_-0.059 are age and sex ."
"clp-fragment01","800","The age distribution_-0.088 of a work force is always an interesting and important source_0 of information ."
"clp-fragment01","801","For most purposes a rectangular_0.441 distribution_0.161 is the most desirable because it provides the appropriate mix_-0.061 of youthful enthusiasm and ageing_0.387 experience ."
"clp-fragment01","802","It also makes_-0.156 for regular changes as staff retire_-0.182 and are replaced_-0.065 ."
"clp-fragment01","803","Many distributions_0.156 show_-0.25 a peak_0.121 in a particular age group_0.219 mainly associated with taking on a large_-0.531 number of young people when the organisation was started or reorganised , this is not desirable_-0.094 because it leads_0 to excessive competition for promotion at particular stages_0.147 ."
"clp-fragment01","804","These comments are obviously most relevant for work forces where there is little tendency to move out , this is characteristic of a surprisingly large_-0.25 number of organisations in European countries and in Japan but much less so in the U.S.A."
"clp-fragment01","805","Stable_0 work forces have their advantages in terms of familiarity_0.156 with the enterprise and its peculiar needs but they do result in problems if the market_-0.226 for the products is erratic or otherwise unpredictable ."
"clp-fragment01","806","This is particularly so in high_0.312 technology e.g. design and construction of ships , aircraft , power stations and chemical plant_-0.029 , where the product unit is large and expensive and the variety of required expertise is extensive_0.091 ."
"clp-fragment01","807","Some peaks_0 of demand can be dealt_0.059 with by using_-0.343 consultants , but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit_-0.486 well with ill-defined but important factors such as the favoured style of the organisation ."
"clp-fragment01","808","In well ordered systems it may be possible to calculate the length_0.182 of in-house experience required to achieve the required level_-0.182 of expertise in particular topics and compare this with the lead time for particular product requirements ."
"clp-fragment01","809","Given time available to train_-0.088 new staff it is not necessary to keep_-0.062 more than a nucleus_0.545 in that particular expertise ."
"clp-fragment01","810","On the other hand_-0.25 , if there is usually insufficient notice of need it may be necessary to keep_-0.441 staff who have periods with little to do between projects ."
"clp-fragment01","811","It is also desirable to have the possibility of shifting_0.235 staff between design and operational duties ."
"clp-fragment01","812","This not only provides flexibility_0.323 in the use of man-power , it also improves communication ."
"clp-fragment01","813","These real difficulties of man-power utilisation are such as to force_-0.118 many organisations to become larger_-0.25 and larger_-0.03 if they are to remain economic ."
"clp-fragment01","814","Size_-0.281 provides a cushion_0.257 to the vicissitudes of markets_-0.182 but it creates other problems ."
"clp-fragment01","815","For example , difficulties of communications and in particular , how to inculcate the feeling_0 within each individual that he and his performance are important to the organisation ."
"clp-fragment01","816","This is considered in more detail in Chapter 3 ."
"clp-fragment01","817","Human resources_0.088 should be fundamental to subjects_0.03 such as ergonomics which are essentially people-centred_0.412 but the concept remains procedurally undeveloped at any level_0 from a continent through countries , regions and companies down to particular working systems ."
"clp-fragment01","818","This is one reason why policy makers_0 never seem to take_-0.5 account_-0.212 fully of the people affected by their decisions ."
"clp-fragment01","819","The design_-0.031 of procedures"
"clp-fragment01","820","The increased importance of standardised informational support_-0.094 for both machines and operators has led_-0.344 to the concept of procedures as a separate design_-0.088 issue within a system ( Fig. 1.30 ) ."
"clp-fragment01","821","Much of this information can be incorporated in computer programs but there is also a need for extensive_0.471 printed paper for the use of the operator ."
"clp-fragment01","822","This takes_-0.324 three main forms_0.03 : checklists , routines and knowledge-texts ."
"clp-fragment01","823","The terminology in this field_-0.219 is not standardised ."
"clp-fragment01","824","Software might be restricted_0.324 , as in this book , to computer programs but it is sometimes used as the generic term to include_0.161 all sources_-0.091 of information ."
"clp-fragment01","825","Procedures is sometimes used for what are here_-0.206 called routines and sometimes to indicate all the operator 's information support_0.03 except software ."
"clp-fragment01","826","The situation_0.242 is further_0.152 confused_0.114 when some but not all the operator information support_-0.147 is itself computer-based_-0.061 ."
"clp-fragment01","827","Sometimes the term firm-ware is used ."
"clp-fragment01","828","However whatever the terminology used there is a requirement for design_0.061 effort ."
"clp-fragment01","829","The quality of procedures would be much improved if designers followed_-0.182 some simple_-0.25 guide-lines ( Table 1.16 ) ."
"clp-fragment01","830","Many documents are written on the implicit assumption that the reader is much like the writer in terms of expertise and style of thinking ."
"clp-fragment01","831","Similarly it is assumed_-0.067 that the conditions under which the reading will take_-0.152 place_-0.129 are the same as those of writing which are usually a clean well-lit office ."
"clp-fragment01","832","They may have to be read in the open air , in rain and darkness or within a plant_0.235 under oily , cramped , poorly lit conditions ."
"clp-fragment01","833","The user probably has limited expertise and he may be working under various stress_0.061 conditions ."
"clp-fragment01","834","The material on which the information is printed , the typeface used , the sequence , the structure_0.028 and the format generally should reflect_0.091 the conditions of use , ( Easterby and Zwaga , 1984 ) ."
"clp-fragment01","835","All these things_-0.294 can be achieved if it is acknowledged that all procedures should a validated by users under the normal conditions of use ."
"clp-fragment01","836","Checklists"
"clp-fragment01","837","Checklists are used in the pre-start mode , for routine maintenance and for fault-finding ."
"clp-fragment01","838","They normally take_-0.706 the form_0 of a series of questions or statements which the operator uses to guide_-0.114 and structure his inspection of the hardware and other system components ."
"clp-fragment01","839","The sequence is dictated_0.129 by the optimal order in which actions should be taken_-0.438 , for example in starting up an aircraft ."
"clp-fragment01","840","There are many situations_-0.286 when the order is of no great_-0.059 consequence , for example a safety audit of a new machine , and in this latter case some logical structure_0 is needed ."
"clp-fragment01","841","As mentioned_-0.062 above_0.094 , the logic of the design_-0.061 may not be the optimal basis if the way_-0.161 the operator thinks and acts is different ."
"clp-fragment01","842","Baker ( 1984 ) suggests that four kinds of shortcoming emerge_0.031 when checklists are validated in the real situation_0.152 ."
"clp-fragment01","843","The operator may deviate from the listed procedure because it may require excessive moving about or because he is interrupted by the requirements of other tasks ."
"clp-fragment01","844","Systematic use of a checklist often reveals_-0.057 faults in work design_0.324 such as inadequate access_-0.176 , visibility and labelling ."
"clp-fragment01","845","The checklist itself may be inconsistent , incomplete , imprecise or ambiguous ."
"clp-fragment01","846","Finally the checklist may have reprographic limitations such as inadequate vertical_0.143 or horizontal_0.097 structure_0.118 , poor_-0.118 typefaces and insufficient linking_0.086 of requirements , descriptions , remarks and tick-off points_0.029 ."
"clp-fragment01","847","The International Ergonomics Association developed a general ergonomics checklist which is reproduced_0 in Edholm ( 1967 ) ."
"clp-fragment01","848","There is a deceptive simplicity about such lists which requires extensive_0.133 effort to ensure a comprehensive but coherent content_-0.03 ."
"clp-fragment01","849","The context_-0.057 is , of course , the context_0.25 of ergonomics as conceived_0.371 by the designers of the list ."
"clp-fragment01","850","Routines"
"clp-fragment01","851","A routine is the most common form_-0.032 of instructional material_0.258 ."
"clp-fragment01","852","The reader is required to follow_-0.25 a series of steps_-0.147 which might , for example , introduce_0.065 a change in the performance_0.091 of a complex system ."
"clp-fragment01","853","Normally routines are single chains_0.156 of instructions although it is possible to have some conditional branching_0.194 ."
"clp-fragment01","854","Each step_-0.061 should be simple_0.273 and complete in itself — preferably with some indication that successful completion has been achieved , for example the appearance or the change of colour of a signal light , or the noise of a motor starting or a change of pressure which indicates that there has been a change in the flow_0.156 of some material ."
"clp-fragment01","855","As mentioned earlier a routine can often be regarded_-0.176 as a written task description ."
"clp-fragment01","856","By definition and design_-0.029 intention routines are inflexible_0.294 ."
"clp-fragment01","857","The user is intended to behave exactly according to their instruction ."
"clp-fragment01","858","No great_-0.29 skill or intellectual effort is required , which is one way_-0.121 of saying_-0.333 that the human operator is being under-used_0.25 , but the purpose of a routine is usually to avoid_-0.257 common human error such as omitting a step_-0.152 or reversing_0.278 steps_-0.118 ."
"clp-fragment01","859","In general the value of formal_-0.121 routines is precisely that the operator , left_-0.152 to himself , will not normally function in such a systematic sequential manner ."
"clp-fragment01","860","Knowledge texts"
"clp-fragment01","861","Knowledge is contained_0.091 in documents which may vary from single sheet presentations to large_-0.343 manuals ."
"clp-fragment01","862","As instructional material_0.059 it is indirect_0.114 in that the reader is not necessarily told_-0.242 what to do , as in a routine ."
"clp-fragment01","863","Rather he is informed about the situation_0.324 and the purpose of informing him is to provide a knowledge base_-0.091 from which he can work out his own actions ."
"clp-fragment01","864","Nevertheless , the relevant action remains important and the knowledge provided should be carefully and stringently selected ."
"clp-fragment01","865","It is too easy to follow_-0.059 the academic tradition and provide knowledge for its own sake ."
"clp-fragment01","866","The ‘ need to know ’ criterion is crucial because unless it is applied_-0.167 , the operator can be overburdened with unnecessary material_0.121 ."
"clp-fragment01","867","Correspondingly the material_0.235 should be structured in terms of how it is most likely to be used ."
"clp-fragment01","868","In this context_0.133 the operator requires a guide_-0.029 for action and not a scientific text-book ."
"clp-fragment01","869","It is invariably better to provide material_-0.061 diagrammatically , systematically or at least in well-structured short_-0.094 paragraphs rather than in flowing_0.129 prose ."
"clp-fragment01","870","Consider_0.265 for example how readily information about the relative position of streets is available from a map of a town centre_-0.029 rather than a verbal description of all the streets ."
"clp-fragment01","871","Such a map will enable the reader to work out for himself how to get from one location to another within the town ."
"clp-fragment01","872","Note_-0.176 the enormous_0.303 flexibility_0.303 compared with a routine which would tell_-0.176 him only how to get from one particular point_-0.065 to another ."
"clp-fragment01","873","A second important difference is that if he misses his place in a routine he will be totally lost_-0.212 , whereas if he happens to go in the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to make_-0.559 whatever correction_0.031 is necessary ."
"clp-fragment01","874","However the map does require more intellectual effort than does the routine not only in making_-0.529 decisions about how to proceed_0.086 but also in filtering_0.088 out the required information from the massive_0.344 irrelevance ( for a particular task ) which is equally available ."
"clp-fragment01","875","Thus , one would expect the use of the maps to be slower than the use of routines with the human performance being more versatile but less predictable ."

"clp-fragment01","881","It is part of the communication package from the designer to the user ."

"clp-fragment01","883","The standard_-0.125 of manual design_0.156 has traditionally been very low_-0.382 for several reasons ."
"clp-fragment01","884","For this purpose , the designer is too familiar with the product and he rarely takes_-0.353 the trouble to find out what the user really needs to know ."
"clp-fragment01","885","Often the manual has to be provided hurriedly at the end_-0.382 of a project when the budget is running_0 out , and it is regarded_-0.176 as a tiresome chore still required after the essential design_0.029 work has been completed ."
"clp-fragment01","886","The problem is particularly acute for computers ."
"clp-fragment01","887","Manuals for cars , machine tools and so on are poor_-0.088 but at least it is possible to observe the mechanisms and their functions ."
"clp-fragment01","888","Most computer operators do not know or wish to know about the mechanisms , and in any case these are not accessible_-0.088 to vision and manipulation ."
"clp-fragment01","889","The computer operator is entirely dependent on the manual , at least in the early stages_0.029 of gaining familiarity with the system and its functions ."
"clp-fragment01","890","He is usually very badly served_0.059 although the principles of manual design_0.031 are well known ."

"clp-fragment01","892","The first part_-0.576 should be a general introduction_0.029 which orientates the readers towards the system , its purpose , its functional structure_-0.088 and mode of operation and its performance limits_-0.194 ."

"clw-fragment01","2","A Model_0.171 to Link_-0.156 Personality Characteristics to a Preference for Science"
"clw-fragment01","3","John Head"
"clw-fragment01","4","Introduction_-0.061"
"clw-fragment01","5","In recent years there has been a steady_-0.029 accumulation of evidence that personality and allied affective factors play_-0.125 a crucial role_-0.229 in determining subject_0.057 choice and student success ."
"clw-fragment01","6","Unfortunately , this evidence has tended to be fragmentary , a collection_-0.138 of separate_0.257 , discrete pieces_-0.059 of information lacking a synthesizing_0.429 theory to provide cohesion and predictive power_0.147 ."
"clw-fragment01","7","The few models_0.235 which have been developed to date may have been correct as far_-0.441 as they go_-0.6 but are clearly incomplete ."
"clw-fragment01","8","For example Roe ( 1952 ) , Eiduson ( 1962 ) and McClelland ( 1962 ) suggested that male scientists often experienced a lonely_-0.029 childhood , perhaps suffering social isolation_0.212 through illness or family circumstances , so that they developed a strong_-0.088 interest in their surrounding material world_-0.333 and a below average interest_0 in other people and relationships ."
"clw-fragment01","9","Maslow ( 1966 ) and Hudson ( 1966 and 1968 ) saw_-0.097 science as providing an emotionally undemanding_0.091 activity appealing_0.143 to boys moving_-0.088 from the calm of latency to the turbulence_0.382 of adolescence ."
"clw-fragment01","10","Even if these descriptions are valid they still leave_-0.029 open_-0.324 a number of questions_0.147 , particularly why the same mechanisms_0.387 do not operate_0.091 with girls ."
"clw-fragment01","11","Arising_0.353 from the evidence in the literature and from our empirical studies at Chelsea College it is now possible to offer a model_0.059 which is compatible with all the evidence and which also has considerable predictive potential ."
"clw-fragment01","12","What we know about persons choosing science"
"clw-fragment01","13","The evidence for an association_0 between personality characteristics and an interest_0 in science has been more fully reviewed by Head ( 1979 ) ."
"clw-fragment01","14","We need now only take_-0.333 note_-0.161 of the most salient features_0.118 ."
"clw-fragment01","15","The most obvious one is that of sex differences ."
"clw-fragment01","16","The predominance of males , particularly in the physical sciences and engineering , throughout the Western world can no longer be satisfactorily attributed to cognitive differences , which are too small_-0.062 , nor to institutional factors ."
"clw-fragment01","17","Equal opportunity in education and employment has not made_-0.429 science any more popular with women ."
"clw-fragment01","18","Furthermore , the characteristics of those students who do opt for science show_-0.188 clear_-0.143 sex differences ."
"clw-fragment01","19","Male scientists , both science students and mature_0.147 , professional scientists , tend to be emotionally reticent , disliking overt emotional expression in others and themselves , and depending upon their partners in personal relationships to take_-0.265 the emotional initiatives ."
"clw-fragment01","20","They will also tend to be authoritarian , conservative and controlled in their thinking ."
"clw-fragment01","21","These differences can be seen_-0.452 quite early on ; we have found_-0.029 boys aged 14 years who were opting for science to be significantly more authoritarian than their peers ."
"clw-fragment01","22","Girls choosing science are not particularly emotionally reticent or rigid_0.125 in their thinking , although they do seem to have low_-0.471 self-esteem in terms of being socially and sexually attractive ."
"clw-fragment01","23","We also know that at about the age of 13 a very high_0 proportion_0.2 of boys are attracted_0.088 to science and scientific careers ."
"clw-fragment01","24","Thereafter , there is a steady_0.257 decline of interest_-0.031 in science and this disillusionment extends_-0.029 right through the secondary-school years and into the undergraduate period ."
"clw-fragment01","25","In contrast_0.065 , only a minority of girls express_-0.139 an interest_-0.125 in science at any age but there is no obvious swing_0.219 from science in the middle_0.094 and late teens ."
"clw-fragment01","26","Some further evidence has come_-0.375 from our use of sentence completion tests with secondary-school pupils_0 as part_-0.394 of our research programme at Chelsea ."
"clw-fragment01","27","Analysis of these responses_-0.083 provides further information on sex differences and between those opting for different subjects_0 ."
"clw-fragment01","28","For example , girls at the age of 12 and 14 years seem to take_-0.281 a more mature_-0.056 attitude_-0.031 to personal relationships , seeing_-0.031 their complexity and reciprocal nature_0.088 , while boys are more exploitative ."
"clw-fragment01","29","In relation to the sentence stem_0.25 ‘ A girl and her mother … ’ , girls often produce_0.371 responses_0.273 like ‘ often go_-0.774 through a bad patch_0.364 for a year but once they learn to understand each other , become the best of friends ’ or ‘ can help each other with their problems ’ ."
"clw-fragment01","30","Similar questions , when asked of boys , tend to produce_0.028 banal responses or exploitative ones , for example the parent is seen_-0.353 as the source_-0.029 of money ."
"clw-fragment01","31","In contrast_0.091 , boys seem to have a firmer_0.25 self-identity and a clearer_-0.2 ambition showing_-0.118 more insight in response to sentence stems_0.576 such as ‘ My main problem is … ’ and ‘ He/she felt_-0.618 proud that … ’ ."
"clw-fragment01","32","Such findings give_-0.529 us some clues about the characteristics of boys and girls of these ages ."
"clw-fragment01","33","If we compare boys of 14 years of age who opt for science with other boys , we find_-0.484 that the former have very cut-and-dried views_-0.125 on many issues ."
"clw-fragment01","34","For example , they take_-0.364 the view_-0.086 that ‘ criminals should be severely punished ’ or that ‘ anyone who is unpopular deserves his fate ’ ."
"clw-fragment01","35","To the sentence stem_0.147 ‘ When a child will not join_-0.188 in group activities … ’ , these boys gave_-0.156 responses like ‘ he is selfish ’ , ‘ he must be stupid ’ , ‘ he deserves to be unpopular ’ ."
"clw-fragment01","36","In contrast_0.059 , other boys and most girls pondered the possible causes and ways_-0.5 of integrating the child into the group ."
"clw-fragment01","37","The science boys seemed to possess_0.394 few doubts or uncertainties , they offered clear-cut answers ."
"clw-fragment01","38","It was this evidence which suggested_0.176 the possible model_-0.125 for subject_-0.147 choice in terms of ego-identity achievement ."
"clw-fragment01","39","Ego-identity in adolescence"
"clw-fragment01","40","This model_0.091 was originally postulated by Erikson ( 1965 ) and then developed by Marcia ( 1966 and 1976 ) ."
"clw-fragment01","41","Erikson suggests_-0.059 that at different phases_-0.139 of life an individual faces_-0.294 a particular psycho-social problem which needs to be resolved before moving_-0.278 on to the next phase_0.156 ."
"clw-fragment01","42","For adolescents the acquisition_0.088 of a clear_-0.161 ego-identity is the crucial task ."
"clw-fragment01","43","At the beginning of adolescence , the individual is a within the family and the school ."
"clw-fragment01","44","By the end_-0.235 of adolescence he or she needs to make_0 choices about career , life-style , personal relationships and ideologies ."
"clw-fragment01","45","The ego-identity of that person is shaped_0.235 by these choices ."
"clw-fragment01","46","Erikson does not suggest that the development of an ego-identity is a once-and-for-all issue ."
"clw-fragment01","47","Some problems about identity arise_0.226 with the young child in the context_-0.176 of home and school , and others occur in later life , for example on retirement ."
"clw-fragment01","48","Nevertheless , adolescence is the time when ego-identity development inevitably dominates_0.029 the personal development of the individual for a while ."
"clw-fragment01","49","The adolescent does not , however , need to achieve a clear_0 ego-identity on all topics at one time ."
"clw-fragment01","50","He or she may have a clear_-0.242 identity in respect to his or her career but still be unresolved in regard to personal relationships and ideology ."
"clw-fragment01","51","In this article we are concerned with ego-identity achievement in respect to career ."
"clw-fragment01","52","Marcia has put_-0.188 more detail_-0.031 onto the Erikson model_-0.091 and suggests that in going_-0.265 from the initial ego-diffusion_0.097 condition_0.03 to that of having achieved ego-identity , two processes are involved : crisis_0.091 and commitment ."
"clw-fragment01","53","Crisis_0.235 in this context_-0.156 describes_-0.061 a period of intensive self-examination_0.394 in which one 's beliefs and values_-0.25 are re-examined ."
"clw-fragment01","54","Commitment means_-0.088 that the individual has acquired_0.206 clear_-0.212 and firm_-0.206 beliefs both about himself or herself and the world ."
"clw-fragment01","55","Figure 16.1 indicates_0.032 a number of possible routes_0.059 to ego-identity achievements ."
"clw-fragment01","56","A person may undergo crisis_-0.182 and commitment simultaneously and progress_0.118 by route_-0.03 A. An alternative is to undergo a period of considerable self-doubt and self-examination_0.206 in which all one 's beliefs tend to be very fluid_0 , a period known as moratorium , before acquiring_0.2 beliefs for oneself and ego-identity is achieved ( route_0.121 B ) ."
"clw-fragment01","57","A further possibility is that the individual may , at least for a time , hold_-0.419 onto beliefs and values_-0.031 taken_-0.235 without question from others , for example parents , teachers , peers ."
"clw-fragment01","58","This condition_0.152 is known as foreclosure_0.485 ."
"clw-fragment01","59","Eventually these persons might have to face up to period of crisis_0.032 , of self-examination_0.265 , and so achieve ego-identity by route_0.294 C. However , foreclosure_0.273 does offer_-0.235 an escape_-0.059 route_-0.212 and an individual might postpone indefinitely any real self-examination_0.281 by clinging_0.353 rigidly_0.364 to his or her beliefs and values_0.065 ( route_-0.029 D ) ."
"clw-fragment01","60","Ego-identity and Choosing Science"
"clw-fragment01","61","We can now make_-0.455 the link_0.03 between this model_0.125 of adolescent development and subject_-0.242 choice in schools ."
"clw-fragment01","62","For boys at the foreclosure_0.091 stage_-0.235 , science is likely to be appealing ."
"clw-fragment01","63","The physical sciences in particular , offer_-0.147 a conventional career choice which is likely to win_0.059 approval from parents , teachers and peers ."
"clw-fragment01","64","They will tend to regard_0.094 the overt expression of emotions , including much such expression in the arts , as being soft_-0.031 and feminine ."
"clw-fragment01","65","Science , with its masculine image_-0.059 , makes_-0.152 little emotional demand_-0.188 on an individual and seems to offer_-0.515 clear_-0.062 , precise answers_-0.062 to problems ."
"clw-fragment01","66","Opting for science will permit_0.03 and possibly reinforce_0.323 emotional reticence ."
"clw-fragment01","67","For a girl at the foreclosure_0.121 stage_-0.029 the situation_-0.121 is very different ."
"clw-fragment01","68","There is evidence that girls tend to be socialized into adult roles_-0.029 more through their potential of becoming a mother and housewife than through their career ( Douvan and Adelson , 1966 ) ."
"clw-fragment01","69","Furthermore , these girls will tend to go_-0.194 into a career with a feminine image_-0.029 , one which already attracts_-0.147 many girls ."
"clw-fragment01","70","Consequently , very few girls at the foreclosure_0.483 stage_-0.03 will enter_-0.032 science unless they receive considerable encouragement and a model_-0.059 to do so from their parents and their school ."
"clw-fragment01","71","Neither boys nor girls at the moratorium stage_-0.094 are likely to be attracted_0.147 to the science that is usually presented_0.086 in our schools ."
"clw-fragment01","72","They are at a stage_-0.094 when they are likely to be concerned with a variety of complex issues ; the meaning of life , the existence of God , ideologies , their emerging sexuality , their future career and life-style — too often science is seen_-0.138 as being purely instrumental with nothing to contribute_0.5 to these debates ."
"clw-fragment01","73","Science , somehow , seems to be scarcely relevant to the most important issues in our life ."
"clw-fragment01","74","A proportion_0.121 of both boys and girls at ego-identity achievement stage_-0.258 will choose_-0.4 science ."
"clw-fragment01","75","In fact , most girls entering_-0.061 science are probably at this stage_-0.097 as they will need some self-examination_0.2 and sense of commitment to make_-0.147 this unconventional choice ."
"clw-fragment01","76","However , only a minority of adolescents will have reached_-0.057 the ego-identity achievement stage_-0.065 at the age when most pupils_0.031 have to make_-0.394 crucial decisions about subject_-0.097 choice at school ."
"clw-fragment01","77","This model_-0.059 seems to explain_-0.343 our observations_-0.242 ."
"clw-fragment01","78","A large_-0.333 number of boys , particularly at the foreclosure_0.406 stage_-0.056 , are initially attracted_-0.031 to science but there is a drift_0.176 away_-0.032 throughout later adolescence as they undergo some crisis_0.235 ."
"clw-fragment01","79","The preponderance of boys at the foreclosure_0.455 stage_-0.114 will yield_0.212 the rigid_0.143 , authoritarian attitudes_0.212 often associated with scientists ."
"clw-fragment01","80","The few girls who enter_-0.2 science will not usually show these foreclosure_0.457 characteristics ."
"clw-fragment01","81","Effects of Curriculum Changes_-0.059"
"clw-fragment01","82","The real use of this model_-0.171 linking_0.111 personality development to subject_0.032 choice is that it allows_-0.303 us to make_-0.639 predictions about how pupils_0.176 might react_-0.029 to changes_-0.176 in school science curriculum and school organization ."
"clw-fragment01","83","We can consider_-0.088 three possible changes_-0.182 :"
"clw-fragment01","84","1"
"clw-fragment01","85","Delaying subject_-0.265 choice : Britain is unusual in asking pupils_0.176 to make_-0.355 crucial choices about subject_0.059 options in the 13–16 age range_-0.182 ."
"clw-fragment01","86","These decisions can only be reversed_0.194 with great_-0.156 difficulty ."
"clw-fragment01","87","What effect would delaying the choice make_-0.171 ?"
"clw-fragment01","88","In the development through the years of adolescence the number of foreclosure_0.235 pupils_0.242 will diminish , hence the recruitment of boys into science would be cut_-0.147 ."
"clw-fragment01","89","More boys and girls will have reached_0.111 the ego-identity achievement stage_-0.344 and a proportion_0.364 of these will go_-0.303 into science ."
"clw-fragment01","90","Overall there would be a reduction_-0.147 in the number of students choosing science , but those who do so choose will be more likely to stay_-0.156 happily in the subject_-0.056 and to possess more flexible_0.212 minds ."
"clw-fragment01","91","The quantitative loss would be met_-0.394 by a qualitative improvement ."
"clw-fragment01","92","2"
"clw-fragment01","93","Giving_-0.588 science a more feminine image_-0.114 : It is sometimes argued that science textbooks are sexist in showing_-0.182 illustrations of boys , rather than girls , doing practical work in the laboratory , and so forth ."
"clw-fragment01","94","What effect would a deliberate attempt to change_-0.394 this image_-0.118 have ?"
"clw-fragment01","95","It might make_-0.441 it easier for girls at the foreclosure_0.312 stage_-0.303 to accept science so recruitment might increase ."
"clw-fragment01","96","Some of these girls might , however , drift_0.176 away_-0.235 again when they reach_-0.161 their crisis_0.03 period ."
"clw-fragment01","97","Unless the change_-0.176 in image_-0.065 was immense , boys would probably not be affected , science would still be an obvious , acceptable choice for a boy ."
"clw-fragment01","98","Overall there would be some increase in the recruitment of girls , but no qualitative improvement ."
"clw-fragment01","99","3"
"clw-fragment01","100","Emphasizing_0.471 the applications_0.424 and relevance of science : To obtain a major qualitative improvement to recruitment in science with more girls and with students possessing_0.118 imaginative , flexible_0.114 minds it would be necessary to make_-0.588 science appealing to boys and girls at the moratorium stage_0.2 ."
"clw-fragment01","101","In that event science must be seen_-0.344 to be relevant to the issues which concern them ."
"clw-fragment01","102","The probable implication is that science would need to be presented_0.176 in the context_0.029 of the needs of society and individuals ."
"clw-fragment01","103","Probably a case-study approach_0.242 involving the application_0.059 of science , and the interaction_0.235 with other disciplines , would be needed ."
"clw-fragment01","104","Our knowledge about the girls ' concern with personal relationships suggests_-0.118 that the introduction of some elements_0.29 of the social sciences into the case studies might prove attractive_0.121 ."
"clw-fragment01","105","Is it possible to change_-0.156 school science in this fashion_0.235 and still preserve_-0.125 the essential character_0.353 of science itself ?"
"clw-fragment01","106","Clearly there would need to be some drastic pruning_0.344 of content ."
"clw-fragment01","107","Perhaps science teachers should not attempt to cover_-0.594 their subjects_0.062 so comprehensively ."
"clw-fragment01","108","A history teacher is content to cover_0.086 the history of one country or continent over a few decades ."
"clw-fragment01","109","Perhaps we must make_-0.441 similar choices ."
"clw-fragment01","110","It is interesting to notice that the Association for Science Education ( 1979 ) policy statement in Britain and the proposals on school physics coming_-0.147 from the Institute for Science Education ( IPN ) in Kiel are advocating_0.364 such changes_-0.324 ."
"clw-fragment01","111","The difference is that we are now offering a formal_-0.031 psychological model_0 to suggest that if we want to reduce_0.088 the current encapsulation_0.515 of science , if we want to recruit_0.206 a different sort of student , then certain curriculum changes_-0.031 are needed ."

"clw-fragment01","115","Over_-0.457 90 per cent of entries_0 in all technical subjects_0.233 are from boys ."
"clw-fragment01","116","This means_-0.485 that schoolgirls are ineligible for a wide_-0.206 range_-0.086 of courses_-0.061 in further and higher_-0.03 education and for entry_-0.242 to occupations_0.257 requiring a scientific or technical base_0.059 ."

"clw-fragment01","119","In effect , ignoring the effects of gender in this way_-0.353 merely reinforces_0.29 stereotyping because it does nothing to challenge_0.152 the definition of certain aspects_0.294 of the curriculum as masculine or feminine ."

"clw-fragment01","130","Despite some evidence of change_-0.257 in teachers ' attitudes_-0.152 and behaviour , they themselves were reluctant to admit_-0.125 that the project had influenced them ."
"clw-fragment01","131","According to an evaluation report this may reflect_0.114 an unwillingness to admit_-0.219 that in the past schools have been sex biased ( Payne , Cuff and Hustler , 1984 ) ."
"clw-fragment01","132","The GIST hypothesis was that female under-achievement in science and technology is at least partly socially constructed_0.062 by the school , an hypothesis based_-0.375 on research evidence as well as critical feminist analysis ( see_-0.286 , for example , Kelly , 1981 ) ."
"clw-fragment01","133","During the project there was a shift_0 away from locating_-0.312 the issue as one of girls ' motivation towards attempts to change_0.094 the nature_0.212 of school science ."
"clw-fragment01","134","One of the main gains from the GIST project has been the clarification of what is meant_-0.235 by a ‘ girl friendly ’ , science , that is a science which will appeal_-0.188 equally to the interests_-0.121 and concerns of girls as well as boys . …"
"clw-fragment01","135","Making_0.152 Science More Girl Friendly"
"clw-fragment01","136","Several interventions were designed_-0.059 to make_-0.355 science more girl friendly ."
"clw-fragment01","137","Schools and teachers tried_-0.229 curriculum development to build_0.086 on girls ' science interests_0.29 , changing_-0.118 patterns_-0.206 of classroom interaction , single sex groups and classes ."
"clw-fragment01","138","The largest_0.088 scale_0.062 intervention was the VISTA programme , which consisted of women scientists and technologists visiting schools to talk to children about an aspect_-0.121 of their jobs already being covered_-0.139 in the school science syllabus ."
"clw-fragment01","139","VISTA made_-0.452 science more girl friendly in two ways_-0.029 : both boys and girls were offered an attractive_0.406 image_-0.235 of a competent woman scientist , and talks concentrated_0.29 on social and industrial applications_0.194 of science , an element_0.333 too often missing from science at school ."
"clw-fragment01","140","One school was so impressed by the children 's positive reactions_-0.057 that they completely revamped the science work in the first two years to include_-0.097 more social and human applications_0.242 of science ."
"clw-fragment01","141","The survey_0.229 of children 's attitudes_0.176 helped_-0.371 here_-0.265 : research such as Ormerod 's ( 1971 ; Ormerod and Duckworth , 1975 ) had shown_-0.121 that girls were interested in the social implications of science , but did not tell teachers what the desirable teaching approach_-0.171 might be in practice ."
"clw-fragment01","142","Would science in the home_-0.364 be a starter_-0.03 ?"
"clw-fragment01","143","A question from our survey_-0.118 asked_-0.371 children whether they would like to know more about how a vacuum cleaner works ; hardly anyone did , and girls were even less curious than boys ."
"clw-fragment01","144","This told_-0.424 us that any simplistic assumptions about featuring ‘ female ’ domestic interests_0 in science would probably meet_-0.03 with failure ."
"clw-fragment01","145","The rest of the questionnaire about science curiosity showed_0.059 that all the children were enthusiastic about learning science , and that girls were keen_0.176 to know more about nature , the environment and medical science ."
"clw-fragment01","146","Over_-0.29 50 per cent , and in some cases over_-0.412 60 per cent said they would like to learn about the human heart , germs and illnesses , how our muscles work_-0.419 , what food is good for you , life in the sea , what makes_-0.067 a rainbow appear and how a record is made ."
"clw-fragment01","147","It was helpful that these topics also interested boys ."
"clw-fragment01","148","At present the science curriculum is structured_0.222 around physical science interests_0.062 , on which boys are keener_0.419 ( how motor cars work_-0.469 , atoms and molecules ) ; we were able to recommend that teaching build_-0.125 on the overlapping_0.273 interests_-0.059 of the two sexes , because girls as well as boys want to know more about human biology and spectacular features_-0.03 of the environment ( animals in the jungle , volcanoes and earthquakes , acids and chemicals ) ."
"clw-fragment01","149","The less immediately attractive_0.057 parts_-0.438 of science could be approached_0.059 through these interests_-0.212 , for instance teaching ‘ forces ’ by beginning with the action_-0.324 of muscles in the human arm , and ‘ light ’ via the dissection of a bull 's eye ."
"clw-fragment01","150","When women scientists employ such approaches_0.188 , and describe their own work , as happened during the VISTA programme , girls are receiving double_0.059 encouragement ."
"clw-fragment01","151","These examples indicate_0.303 some of the features_0.176 of girl friendly science : it builds_-0.156 on girls ' interests_0.182 , not just boys ' ; it explicitly encourages_0.147 girls to see_-0.303 themselves as potential scientists , and it includes_-0.382 some of the social and human implications and applications_0.097 of science ."
"clw-fragment01","152","Other GIST Interventions"
"clw-fragment01","153","All the GIST schools were mixed comprehensives , and at first teachers were most unwilling to separate boys and girls at all , on the grounds that it ran_-0.147 counter to their co-educational comprehensive philosophy ."
"clw-fragment01","154","Then certain teachers were particularly struck_0.062 by the evidence of large_-0.241 differences in the interests_-0.143 and experience children brought_-0.029 with them to school ."
"clw-fragment01","155","Girls had far_-0.382 less ‘ tinkering ’ experience than boys and the connection_-0.167 with their lesser interest_0 in topics like ‘ how electricity is produced ’ seemed obvious ."
"clw-fragment01","156","Several special science or craft clubs were organized in the lunch hour for girls only and in two schools teachers planned_-0.118 single-sex teaching ."
"clw-fragment01","157","As we shall see_-0.125 , it was in these two schools that the largest_-0.303 measurable changes_-0.219 of attitude_-0.147 and option choice occurred ."
"clw-fragment01","158","For a more girl friendly science , it seems vital_0.062 that teachers should come_-0.303 to see_-0.5 that when all the masculine packaging_0.455 , evident in textbooks and resources_-0.088 as well as teachers ' and boys ' behaviour in the classroom , is removed_-0.2 , girls can be very enthusiastic about science . …"
"clw-fragment01","159","Alison Kelly sees_-0.382 at least four distinct_-0.057 senses in which it can be argued that science is masculine ."
"clw-fragment01","160","First , the pupils_0.161 , teachers and practitioners of science are overwhelmingly male in terms of numbers ; second , school science is packaged_0.121 and presented_0.088 to appeal_-0.188 to boys , not girls ; third , classroom behaviours and interaction operate_0.118 to reconstruct_0.5 science as a male activity , and finally it has been suggested that ‘ scientific ’ thinking embodies an intrinsically masculine world_0.083 view_-0.314 ."
"clw-fragment01","161","The GIST interventions described above_-0.412 relate to three of these : VISTA women , albeit briefly and temporarily , redressed the numerical balance_0.156 by offering female role models of practising scientists ; VISTA and the curriculum development which followed_-0.294 involved a limited ‘ repackaging_0.182 ’ of science to remove_-0.059 its exclusively masculine appeal_0 , and the single-sex classes and classroom observation showed_-0.059 how science comes_-0.455 to be defined_-0.033 as ‘ masculine ’ in the mixed school ."
"clw-fragment01","162","The fourth point_-0.094 , the idea that science is intrinsically masculine , can be sustained_0.171 only by clinging_0.235 to an irredeemably narrow_0.545 conception of science and scientific thinking ."
"clw-fragment01","163","The industrial and social impact_0 of science on health , on people , on the environment , a focus_-0.03 on the beauty and complexity of the natural world , are notable omissions from the school science syllabus ."
"clw-fragment01","164","Girls are not uninterested in science , they are bored by the limited version_0.061 of it they meet_-0.029 in school ."
"clw-fragment01","165","One of the purposes of an extended_0.176 period of single-sex science teaching might be to let teachers see_-0.625 how girls approach_-0.118 scientific matters , and to discover_-0.176 , what may well be the case , that girls are just as capable of ‘ scientific thinking ’ as boys ."
"clw-fragment01","166","Margaret Spear , in a different study from the one reported in this volume , found_-0.353 that for identical work boys were marked higher_-0.188 than girls for supposed understanding of principles , aptitude for science and O level suitability ( Spear , 1984 ) ."

"crs-fragment01","12","BACKGROUND_0.273 : UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON , 1983"
"crs-fragment01","13","Islington is a multi-ethnic , inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000 ."
"crs-fragment01","14","In 1982 , 44 per cent of under_-0.147 fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility , 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis ."
"crs-fragment01","15","Between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased , so that by 1988 there were 12 children 's day centres , about_-0.594 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department , and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority ."
"crs-fragment01","16","The Beacon Nursery , a local Mencap project , offered_-0.062 care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties ."
"crs-fragment01","17","Unlike council day centres , playgroups or community nurseries , the Beacon Nursery was free_-0.324 ."
"crs-fragment01","18","Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand ."
"crs-fragment01","19","The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to_-0.412 thirty children with a wide_0.029 range_-0.032 of disabilities and needs ."
"crs-fragment01","20","By 1983 it had half that number on roll_-0.176 ."
"crs-fragment01","21","Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall_-0.059 as it was increasingly seen_-0.125 as a resource_0.129 for children with severe and multiple disabilities ."
"crs-fragment01","22","In addition the Elfreda Rathbone organisation , a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities , ran_-0.529 a free_0 day nursery in the borough for a small_-0.364 number of children with learning difficulties ."
"crs-fragment01","23","Some integrated services emerged_0.371 in the early 1980s — one playscheme was developed through a parent 's initiative , and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation ."
"crs-fragment01","24","Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported_0.059 a local special school in integrating under_-0.118 fives into a playgroup ."
"crs-fragment01","25","In addition to its mainstream schools , the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs — one for children with moderate learning difficulties , one for children with severe learning difficulties , one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties , one for autistic children , and one for children with physical disabilities ."
"crs-fragment01","26","In 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2 ."
"crs-fragment01","27","The children using all of these services came from a wide_0 range_0 of ethnic backgrounds_0.091 , though rarely was this_-0.364 actively and positively reflected_-0.062 in the type of care provided or the ethnic background_0.088 of their carers ."
"crs-fragment01","28","Residential units"
"crs-fragment01","29","By 1983 residential services were designed_0.03 with ‘ care in the community ’ in mind , but most were based in specialist settings ."
"crs-fragment01","30","For example , Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties , and was designed_0.088 to offer respite ‘ round the clock ’ care ."
"crs-fragment01","31","Parents had fought_0.121 for this as a local resource_-0.086 to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home ."
"crs-fragment01","32","By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children 's respite care unit at Leigh Road ."
"crs-fragment01","33","The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care ( by 1988 their number had been reduced_0.118 to eleven ) , none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties ."
"crs-fragment01","34","The Community Health Team"
"crs-fragment01","35","The Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision ."
"crs-fragment01","36","It included physiotherapists , occupational and speech therapists , doctors , psychologists and a specialist health visitor ."
"crs-fragment01","37","They were joined in the network_0 by specialist teachers , funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools , who visited children at home before they were due to start school ."
"crs-fragment01","38","This group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate_-0.129 services and discuss professional issues ."
"crs-fragment01","39","Discussion of services to individual children also took_-0.273 place_-0.406 ."
"crs-fragment01","40","This included deciding between day care or school , and parents ' attitudes_0.061 to different options ."
"crs-fragment01","41","Often a member_-0.062 of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course_-0.088 of action ."
"crs-fragment01","42","The Community Health Team aim_-0.188 was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age , to enable them to develop to their fullest_0 potential ."
"crs-fragment01","43","They were , however , an all-White group , operating_-0.03 without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community ."
"crs-fragment01","44","They gave_-0.364 support_-0.125 to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw_-0.4 these settings as the best places to ‘ treat ’ children ."
"crs-fragment01","45","Because of their early contact_-0.03 with parents they often had considerable influence in steering_0.029 parents towards specialist provision ."
"crs-fragment01","46","The Special Services Team"
"crs-fragment01","47","In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for ‘ partially hearing ’ children ."
"crs-fragment01","48","These social workers were based in the borough 's Special Services Team ."
"crs-fragment01","49","They all worked with some under_0.167 fives attending the schools they covered_0.118 ."
"crs-fragment01","50","They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access_-0.086 to resources_-0.121 or support_0 when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability ."
"crs-fragment01","51","When a vacancy arose_-0.091 within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under_-0.344 fives with special needs ."
"crs-fragment01","52","This might have had the effect of drawing_0 families into the specialist system_0.065 at an earlier stage_0.156 ."
"crs-fragment01","53","Instead , for a number of reasons , it proved to be a key step_0.032 in the development of the debate about integration in Islington ."
"crs-fragment01","54","First , the post was not attached_-0.03 to any specialist institution ."
"crs-fragment01","55","There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely_-0.031 with the Beacon Nursery ."
"crs-fragment01","56","Second , the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling_-0.03 access_-0.2 to all other under-fives facilities ."
"crs-fragment01","57","Third , the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take_-0.382 precedence over the child 's social , emotional and cultural needs ."
"crs-fragment01","58","There was now a new worker in the network_0.129 who also made_-0.281 an early relationship with families but who could present a broader_-0.059 choice of day care to parents ."
"crs-fragment01","59","ATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY"
"crs-fragment01","60","The Labour Council , elected in 1982 , had as a stated policy aim_0.156 that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort ."
"crs-fragment01","61","This led_-0.265 to the initiation of an under-fives review ."
"crs-fragment01","62","The review team , set_-0.441 up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee , included councillors , senior departmental management and representatives of the children 's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership ."
"crs-fragment01","63","It proposed a network_0.062 of under-fives centres throughout the borough — an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time ."
"crs-fragment01","64","Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated_-0.029 through the children 's day centres which would also provide information , support_-0.03 and resources_-0.147 to parents ."
"crs-fragment01","65","The review had made_-0.576 no mention of children with special needs ."
"crs-fragment01","66","The specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources_0.088 for these children ."
"crs-fragment01","67","They interviewed parents , specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed_-0.031 a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations , as well as by some child-minders ."
"crs-fragment01","68","Broadly , the survey confirmed_-0.062 that parents of children with special needs had not been given_-0.258 a real choice of placement , and that they had to fight_-0.088 hard_-0.4 for mainstream provision if this was their choice ."
"crs-fragment01","69","Parents wanted to be part_-0.344 of the decision-making and did not feel_-0.618 that they were ."
"crs-fragment01","70","Many commented on lack of information about the range_0 of facilities on offer ."
"crs-fragment01","71","One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt_-0.265 that she was never given_-0.152 a choice of provision for her son , and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good ."
"crs-fragment01","72","She fought_-0.057 hard_-0.576 to get_-0.294 him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended ."
"crs-fragment01","73","Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to ‘ have a go_-0.257 ’ and the placement went_-0.206 ahead_-0.242 ."
"crs-fragment01","74","She commented :"
"crs-fragment01","75","I had to fight_-0.125 every step_0.031 of the way_-0.059 for this ."
"crs-fragment01","76","No one told me about it , and no one wanted him to have it ."
"crs-fragment01","77","I knew it was right for him — this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children ."
"crs-fragment01","78","It does n't matter that he 's not like them ."
"crs-fragment01","79","I know what is right for my child , but I 'm not supposed to say ."
"crs-fragment01","80","Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist ‘ therapy ’ time , but wanted it to be used in a more flexible_0.147 way_-0.273 ."
"crs-fragment01","81","Some parents were very worried_-0.091 that more integrated settings would lead_-0.059 to lack of attention for children with special needs ."
"crs-fragment01","82","Definitions of ‘ special needs ’ varied widely_-0.455 in the questionnaire responses — some defining it as children with disabilities , some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English ."
"crs-fragment01","83","This made_-0.529 the survey difficult to interpret ."
"crs-fragment01","84","The findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children ( CCUF 1983 ) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs , with suggestions for how these might be overcome ."
"crs-fragment01","85","These ideas were informed_0.162 by a paper which had already been produced_0.147 by an active member_-0.242 of the local Mencap group , who had previously tried to generate_0.382 the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee ."
"crs-fragment01","86","The conference : ‘ A place for all our children'"
"crs-fragment01","87","As a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under_0.091 Fives ( CCUF ) , an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under_-0.091 fives , decided to organise a conference to look_-0.031 at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision ."
"crs-fragment01","88","Prior to the conference various groups met to produce_-0.094 short contributions to the debate ."
"crs-fragment01","89","These included parents , under-fives workers , specialist workers , children 's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers ."
"crs-fragment01","90","Each of these groups came_-0.333 up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending ."
"crs-fragment01","91","About_-0.286 230 people attended the conference , held_-0.243 in April 1985 ."
"crs-fragment01","92","Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies , overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources_-0.088 of information ."
"crs-fragment01","93","The conference made_-0.257 the following recommendations :"
"crs-fragment01","94","1"
"crs-fragment01","95","For a formal , universal information system_0.088 , covering_-0.118 local and specialist resources_0.152 ."
"crs-fragment01","96","2"
"crs-fragment01","97","For children 's needs to be considered_-0.031 with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised ."
"crs-fragment01","98","3"
"crs-fragment01","99","For employment of extra staff where needed , and employment of peripatetic special needs workers ."
"crs-fragment01","100","4"
"crs-fragment01","101","For availability of money for equipment , toys and adaptations ."
"crs-fragment01","102","5"
"crs-fragment01","103","For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs ."
"crs-fragment01","104","6"
"crs-fragment01","105","For priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access_0.212 to ordinary provision ."
"crs-fragment01","106","7"
"crs-fragment01","107","For training facilities for staff in ordinary provision , specialist provision and child-minders ."
"crs-fragment01","108","8"
"crs-fragment01","109","For greater_0.121 communication and sharing of resources_-0.118 between ordinary and specialist provision ."
"crs-fragment01","110","9"
"crs-fragment01","111","For therapeutic and professional staff to reflect_0.088 the cultural backgrounds_0.176 of the children , and that for all children , including those with special needs , their day-care environment_0.118 and activities to express_0.118 a consciousness_0.091 of the multicultural society in Islington ."
"crs-fragment01","112","It was made_-0.303 clear_-0.235 that all of the above_-0.059 areas_-0.235 needed funding from health , education and social services before they could be implemented ."
"crs-fragment01","113","Finally , it was felt_-0.059 that unless the attitudes_-0.031 of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration , none of the recommendations could be effective ."
"cty-fragment03","457","II THE FIRST CRITIQUE"
"cty-fragment03","458","Unity had been easy during the Resistance , because relationships were almost always man-to-man ."
"cty-fragment03","459","Over against the German army or the Vichy government , where social generality ruled_0.182 , as it does in all machines_0.375 of state , the Resistance offered_-0.061 the rare phenomenon of historical action which remained personal ."
"cty-fragment03","460","The psychological and moral elements_0.235 of political action were almost the only ones to appear_-0.152 here_-0.265 , which is why intellectuals least inclined_-0.03 to politics were to be seen_-0.143 in the Resistance ."
"cty-fragment03","461","The Resistance was a unique experience for them , and they wanted to preserve_0.059 its experience in the new French politics because this experience broke_0.059 away from the famous dilemma of being and doing , which confronts_0.344 all intellectuals in the face_0.032 of action … ."
"cty-fragment03","462","It is only too obvious that this balance_0.061 between action and personal life was intimately_0.5 bound_0.125 up with the conditions of clandestine action and could not survive_0.031 it ."
"cty-fragment03","463","And in this sense_-0.069 it must be said_-0.429 that the Resistance experience , by making_-0.176 us believe that politics is a relationship_-0.118 between man and man or between consciousnesses , fostered_0.343 our illusions of 1939 and masked_0.258 the truth of the incredible power_-0.031 of history which the Occupation taught_0 us in another connection_0.031 ."
"cty-fragment03","464","If by 1945 Merleau-ponty had here_-0.265 already indicated_-0.097 the historical basis for what was to become Sartre 's project in the Critique , the theoretical problem that followed_-0.059 was how to unite_-0.061 orthodox Marxist concepts of economic determinism and historical necessity with the individualism of Sartre 's earlier work , that is the existentialist notion of the authentic self and the possibility of choosing one 's own freedom : how to relocate_0.147 human practice within historical determinism , to reconcile_0.062 the individual with the social , the idea of agency with that of necessity , or freedom with history ?"
"cty-fragment03","465","For Marxist or Hegelian thought , such an age-old contradiction ought to be resolvable through the operations of dialectical logic ."
"cty-fragment03","466","Citing Marx 's famous remark in The Eighteenth Brumaire , ‘ Men make_-0.182 their own History … but under circumstances … given_-0.188 and transmitted_0.273 from the past ’ , Sartre suggested that this implied ‘ the permanent and dialectical unity of freedom and necessity , ( I , 35 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","467","Accordingly , he attempted to shift_-0.273 Marxism away from orthodox theories of an absolute determinism towards the primacy of a concept of ‘ History ’ which , while still a totality as it had been for Lukács , a process with a determinate meaning and end_-0.2 , could also include_-0.226 a concept of human agency and thus articulate_0.355 the individual with the social , freedom with determinism ."
"cty-fragment03","468","Today , Sartre 's voluntarism is to some extent_-0.061 returning_0.235 to favour as the result of a desire to retrieve_0.344 the categories of agency and the subject_-0.152 , which goes_0.03 together_-0.091 with the wish to get_-0.206 out of the apparently totalizing systems_0.091 of Adorno , Althusser or Foucault ."
"cty-fragment03","469","Sartre 's stress_0.114 on the role_-0.364 of the subject_-0.029 also finds_-0.182 approval because many of those no longer prepared_0.094 to argue for a general theory of history as the progress_0.088 of a single narrative_0.344 of class-struggle_-0.094 , have begun to argue instead for a return_-0.083 of its correlative , the subject_0.086 , almost as if it was the next best thing_0.061 in the absence of history itself ."
"cty-fragment03","470","But it still leaves_-0.353 us with the crucial problem that Sartre had to solve , namely how to link_-0.152 human consciousness with the processes of history so that the former can be said to be the agent_-0.032 of the latter ."
"cty-fragment03","471","How could this take_-0.371 place ?"
"cty-fragment03","472","As Sartre had put_-0.281 it in What is Literature ? :"
"cty-fragment03","473","‘ Never has homo faber better understood that he has made_-0.278 history and never has he felt_-0.147 so powerless before history ’ ."
"cty-fragment03","474","How can man make_-0.176 history if at the same time it is history which makes_-0.1 him ?"
"cty-fragment03","475","Sartre considered_-0.212 that orthodox dialectical materialism takes_-0.457 the easy way_-0.324 out by merely eliminating_0.375 the first in favour of the second , making_-0.412 man a passive_0.364 product_-0.176 entirely determined by economic circumstances ."
"cty-fragment03","476","Unwilling to follow_-0.364 Merleau-Ponty by dropping_0.235 the second in favour of the first , Sartre argued that it was possible for man to be both at once through the movement_0.25 of praxis , that is intentional actions which produce_-0.088 material_0 effects ."
"cty-fragment03","477","Its corollary , whereby praxis becomes determining history , he called the ‘ practico-inert_0.647 ’ , by which he meant the material circumstances that have themselves been created by previous praxes and which form the conditions for new praxis ."
"cty-fragment03","478","The individual is thus both totalizer and totalized , deftly_0.257 uniting_0.118 freedom with necessity ."
"cty-fragment03","479","Though this neatly_-0.094 solves_0.059 the problem of how man can make_-0.559 history while at the same time history makes_-0.061 him , it does not answer_-0.094 the larger_-0.029 question of how a multiplicity of the products_0.121 of individual acts , ‘ totalizations ’ , can themselves be totalized into the overall totalization required by the logic of dialectical rationality — rather than being the arbitrary , blind_0.5 and self-cancelling movements_0.152 of , say_-0.258 , Hardy 's immanent will ."
"cty-fragment03","480","Sartre 's fundamental thesis , that ‘ History continually effects totalisations of totalisations ’ ( I , 15 ) , does not in itself answer_-0.242 what Ronald Aronson has rightly characterized as the question for Sartre : ‘ how do separate_0.143 , antagonistic_0.343 actions yield_0.265 a history ; how do individual totalizations lead_-0.324 to Totalization ( and also progress_0.111 , the direction_0 of history , its truth and its meaning ) ? ’"
"cty-fragment03","481","For the whole_-0.114 basis of Sartre 's argument is that the dialectic of history is not a metaphysical law_-0.229 , ‘ some powerful_-0.03 unitary force_-0.088 revealing_0.273 itself behind History like the will of God ’ , but the continuously_0.059 produced_0.125 effect of individual conflicts ; each action is in its turn_0 subsumed as a part_-0.5 of the whole in an ever broader_0.094 , developing totalization ( I , 37 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","482","What Sartre needs to demonstrate , therefore , is that if the law_-0.206 of the dialectic works_0 from the individual level_-0.294 , overall it produces_0.03 nothing less than the intelligibility or the meaning of History as such :"
"cty-fragment03","483","The dialectic is the law_0.229 of totalization which creates several collectivities , several societies , and one history — realities , that is , which impose_0.182 themselves on individuals ; but at the same time it must be woven_0.406 out of millions of individual actions ."
"cty-fragment03","484","We must show_-0.529 that it is possible for it to be both a resultant … and a totalizing force_0.029 … how it can continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration ."
"cty-fragment03","485","( I , 36 )"
"cty-fragment03","486","But what produces_0.182 the overall direction_-0.265 of History ?"
"cty-fragment03","487","How does it ‘ continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration ’ ?"
"cty-fragment03","488","Sartre does not attempt to answer this question , shifting_0.206 rather to the notion of a lack of self-consciousness ."
"cty-fragment03","489","The dialectic is the law_-0.03 that remains hidden_0.114 ."
"cty-fragment03","490","At the moment , ‘ history is made_-0.485 without being known ( l'histoire se fait sans se connâitre ) ’ — history constitutes , we might say today , a political_0.257 unconscious_0.387 ."
"cty-fragment03","491","‘ Marxism ’ , on the other hand_-0.167 , Sartre claims , ‘ is History itself becoming conscious_0.312 of itself ’ ( I , 40 ) : as for Lukács , it is by becoming conscious_0.382 of itself as the subject_-0.031 of history that the working class will understand_0.097 history 's meaning — and so recognize_0 itself as the meaning of history ."
"cty-fragment03","492","While he suggests_-0.176 in apocalyptic tones_0.353 in The Problem of Method that this process of self-consciousness is at last beginning to take_-0.364 place , and that civil , foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different forms_-0.156 of a single class struggle_-0.059 , Sartre also admits_0.152 that the divorce_0.333 between theory and praxis which ensued under Stalinism has generally prevented any clear_0.059 self-consciousness among the masses_0.273 ."
"cty-fragment03","493","The ‘ detour_0.258 , of Stalinism is thus formalized as Marxism 's own descent_0.091 into its unconscious_0.156 , resulting in a dream-work_0.677 of heterogeneous histories that have eluded_0.312 systematization and subsumption into the single meaning of Marxism 's own reading_0.061 of history ."
"cty-fragment03","494","It is therefore , Sartre argues , our historical task to make_-0.333 it known , promoting not just the historical process as such , but also the general recognition_0.375 whereby the plurality of the meanings of individual histories can be seen_-0.229 to combine_0.257 to make_-0.242 one history , with one meaning — the ‘ Truth of humanity ’ ( I , 822 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","495","Sartre 's account_0.059 thus sets_-0.394 up the articulation_0.25 of history , univocal meaning , and totality as the indissoluble set of elements_0.333 required for the validation of Marxism , necessary in order to save_-0.206 it from its detour_0.424 from itself ."
"cty-fragment03","496","The problem , however , remains_0.088 how such universals are produced_0.029 from the multiplicity of initiating_0.294 individual praxes ."
"cty-fragment03","497","If History is a history of conflict , how could it be both one and internally_0.206 diversified without the inner_0.094 moving_-0.061 principle of the dialectic ?"
"cty-fragment03","498","How can History be a unity if it is also conflictual , if each action is aimed_-0.031 at destroying_0.25 the other and results in a double_-0.286 negation_0.323 in which the original aims_-0.059 of each action have been destroyed_0.364 by the other ?"
"cty-fragment03","499","If each action negates the aim_0.083 of the other , where is the ‘ unity ’ totalized in the conflict ?"
"cty-fragment03","500","How does History constantly totalize itself ?"
"cty-fragment03","501","( I , 817 — 18 ) Sartre arrives_0.031 at what he calls ‘ the real problem of History ’ , that is how there can be totalization without a totalizer , only at the very end_-0.062 of Volume I. It is not until the next volume , however , that he intends to show_-0.588 how individual actions , separate multiplicities , make_-0.314 up ‘ one human history , with one truth and one intelligibility ’ ( I , 69 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","502","Throughout_0.029 , Sartre has nevertheless taken_-0.114 it ‘ for granted that such a totalisation is constantly developing both as History and as historical Truth ’ ( I , 822 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","503","His History , therefore , is always in process : but its teleology of a final totalization always has to be assumed_0.029 ."
"cty-fragment03","504","He thus asserts the Truth of History while constantly projecting_0.242 forwards_-0.125 and deferring its proof ."
"cty-fragment03","505","But when the proof comes_-0.333 it also turns_-0.667 out to rest_-0.088 on the assumption that it is already true_-0.242 ."
"cty-fragment03","506","III THE SECOND CRITIQUE :"
"cty-fragment03","507","‘ We are trying to establish the Truth of History'"
"cty-fragment03","508","Sartre produces_0 a persuasive_0.088 formulation_0.312 of the relation_0.114 of the individual to the determining historical circumstance through his concepts of praxis and the practico-inert_0.188 ; it is also obvious to him how the larger_0.235 question of History ought to be solved ."
"cty-fragment03","509","He asserts it often enough : ‘ History continually effects totalisations of totalisations , ( I , 15 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","510","But in Volume I of the Critique , as we have seen_-0.29 , he continually defers the demonstration_0.088 of his proof ."
"cty-fragment03","511","For the ‘ dogmatic dialectic ’ , as he describes dialectical materialism , the whole_-0.125 question naturally_0.219 poses no problem , for each person or group simply constitutes a partial moment of an already operative_0 movement_0.091 of totalization that produces_-0.059 them and then goes_-0.353 beyond them ."
"cty-fragment03","512","But Sartre 's dispensing_0.281 with all historicist schemas_0.273 creates the problem of how , between two autonomous and contradictory totalizations , there could be ‘ one dialectical intelligibility of the ongoing process ’ ( II , 13 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","513","He attempts to solve this through matching_-0.057 his account_0.235 of contradiction with a new concept derived_0.353 from the conjunction of work and labour : ‘ anti-labour ’ ( anti-travail ) , a category of negation_0.371 ."
"cty-fragment03","514","The products_-0.088 of a conflict , as well as its residues_0.343 , may seem incomprehensible insofar as they differ from the original intentions of any of the combatants_0.379 ."
"cty-fragment03","515","Nevertheless they constitute the basis and conditions for further actions and history ."
"cty-fragment03","516","Dialectical reason encounters_0.061 such products_-0.097 as undecidables :"
"cty-fragment03","517","aporias — because they seem to be at once the results of a communal enterprise while at the same time bearing_0.097 witness_0.312 to the fact that this enterprise never existed except as the inhuman reverse side_-0.129 of two opposed actions in which each aims_-0.086 to destroy_0.143 the other ."
"cty-fragment03","518","In the dialectical perspective_0.355 , we encounter_0.094 these objects_-0.059 as productions which are human and provided with a future … thus they seem by themselves to be totalizations in process ."
"cty-fragment03","519","( II , 20 )"
"cty-fragment03","520","This means_-0.118 that first , they lead_-0.382 to results , and second , that the internal_0 structure_0.455 of social objects_0.125 contains_0 ‘ the double negation_0.333 of themselves and of each constituent part_0 by the other ’ ( II , 22 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","521","There is , therefore , before any understanding of historic agents_0.156 and movements_0.429 , a certain aporia in all social ensembles_0.188 : from afar_0.226 they may appear_-0.257 whole_0.059 , but close_-0.091 to , they can be seen_-0.344 as riddled_0.529 with holes_0.121 ."
"cty-fragment03","522","This increasingly comes_-0.091 to resemble nothing so much as Sartre 's own account_0.212 of History ."
"cty-fragment03","523","In the context_0.235 of the negativity of this formulation_0.353 , Sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization , without any independent totalizer or totalizing force_0.139 such as the dialectic , or whether the structure_0.176 of negation_0.5 that he has described means_-0.059 that , as for Adorno or Bakhtin , history does not develop positively but , rather , negatively , and is therefore instead detotalizing :"
"cty-fragment03","524","Marxism is rigorously true_-0.333 if History is totalization ; it is not so any more if human history decomposes_0.375 into a plurality of particular histories , or if , in any case , within the relationship_0.364 of immanence that characterizes struggle_-0.088 , the negation_0.412 of each adversary_0.559 by the other is on principle detotalizing ."
"cty-fragment03","525","Certainly , we have neither the design_0.062 nor the actual possibility of showing_0.118 here_-0.471 the full_-0.03 truth of dialectical materialism …"
"cty-fragment03","526","Our goal_0.118 is solely to establish whether , in a practical ensemble_0.343 torn_-0.125 apart_0.121 by antagonism ( whether there are multiple conflicts or whether they are reduced_-0.156 to one ) the breaks_0.286 themselves are totalizing and carried_0.176 along by the totalizing movement_0.032 of the ensemble_0.219 ."
"cty-fragment03","527","( II , 25 )"
"cty-fragment03","528","At this point_-0.083 Sartre confronts_0.312 the possibility that the whole_-0.229 project of the Critique , stated so confidently on its very first page — ‘ it must be proved that a negation_0.412 of a negation_0.424 can be an affirmation_0.273 ’ ( I , 15 ) — may break_-0.171 down ."
"cty-fragment03","529","perhaps the Truth of History can not be proved ; its direction_0.161 can not be discerned_0.306 ."
"cty-fragment03","530","Sartre 's reaction_-0.029 to the threat_-0.03 that the negation_0.206 of a negation_0.355 may produce_0.097 a detotalizing effect is to introduce_-0.219 a new category , a unifying force_0.091 of a ‘ singularization ’ which incarnates_0.133 the universal : ‘ If totalization really is an ongoing process ’ , he writes , ‘ then it operates_0.152 everywhere ."
"cty-fragment03","531","That means both that there is a dialectical meaning of the practical ensemble_0.294 … and that each singular event totalizes in itself the practical ensemble_0.273 in the infinite richness_0.625 of its singularity ’ ( II , 26 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","532","Unlike Lukács ' insignificant event from which the universal is precariously drawn_-0.147 out through the narrative , Sartre 's singularity works_-0.353 synecdochally in a conventional antinomy with the universal , the relation_0.094 between the two structured_0.121 according to the familiar_-0.143 nineteenth-century model_-0.029 of organic_0.455 growth_-0.156 or process in which each singular event makes_-0.273 up the whole while , as he puts_-0.448 it , ‘ the whole is entirely present in the part_-0.118 as its present_0 meaning and as its destiny ’ ."
"cty-fragment03","533","Sartre 's ‘ singular universal ’ , therefore , begs_0.364 the question , for it is predicated on the assumption that , if there is not a totality as such , then there already is an overall totalization : ‘ If totalization really is an ongoing process … ’ ."
"cty-fragment03","534","That developing process is itself totalized through Sartre 's assertion_0.242 that each totalization is the totalization of all struggles_0.219 , as it must be if the singular is to incarnate_0.625 the universal ."
"cty-fragment03","535","The concept of the singular universal thus facilitates a circularity in the argument whereby Sartre can avoid_-0.125 the question which he began by posing ."
"cty-fragment03","536","So the singular universal presumes_0.229 the totalization he ca n't ( yet ) prove ."
"cty-fragment03","537","This strategy_0.212 marks_0.156 a structure_-0.029 of repetition in Sartre 's text : each time he poses the question of how there can be totalization of History without a totalizer , he retreats_0.162 to a more limited example whose unity is already evident , but which in the end_-0.559 only brings_-0.118 him back to the original question again ."
"cty-fragment03","538","In this case Sartre demonstrates_-0.029 how the singular universal works_-0.387 , by appealing_0.212 to the concrete_0.433 example of a boxing match — a random exemplification that just happens to reproduce_0.4 the single adversaries_0.353 of the master/slave dialectic ."
"cty-fragment03","539","Its totalization takes_-0.343 place through its incarnation_0.576 , as part_-0.111 of the totality of boxing , in the overall framework_0.222 within which each individual fight occurs ."
"cty-fragment03","540","Each boxing match , Sartre claims , must be both a unique event and also in some sense_-0.353 the incarnation_0.353 of all boxing , whose rules_-0.212 and conventions it follows_0 , and whose past and future history it sets_-0.194 itself against ."
"cty-fragment03","541","But it is also apparent that that totality is not completely known , nor is its future shape_0 even presumed ."
"cty-fragment03","542","By totalization , therefore , Sartre does not here_-0.161 mean anything like a predetermined end_-0.273 or final closure_0.278 of a totality but rather a process of mediation_-0.061 among the parts_-0.1 , where each is determined by the other ."
"cty-fragment03","543","No one can predict the future of boxing , either at the level_-0.059 of particular victories_0.03 or defeats_-0.065 , in effect a structure_0 of repetition , nor at the more general level_-0.235 of possible modifications or developments of the sport ."
"cty-fragment03","544","Yet each individual bout articulates_0.333 itself within the framework_0.242 of the history of boxing , known and unknown ."
"cty-fragment03","545","This allows_-0.143 Sartre to include_0 chance and contingency in his scheme ."
"cty-fragment03","546","Since it can not be known as a concept that will realize_-0.206 itself in the future , Sartre argues instead that the totality only produces_0.057 itself in the moment : ‘ The incarnation_0.062 as such is at once unrealizable except as totalization of everything and irreducible to a pure_0.176 abstract unity of that which it totalizes ’ ( II , 58 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","547","The universal , the totality , can only be known through the singular ."
"cty-fragment03","548","But its future direction_-0.167 remains unknown and indeterminate ."
"cty-fragment03","549","At the same time Sartre makes_-0.235 a larger_-0.091 , though less persuasive claim that the boxing-match also works_-0.286 synecdochally and re-exteriorizes a more fundamental violence , namely the interiorized condition of scarcity that he considers_-0.121 to be the basis of conflict in general ."
"cty-fragment03","550","The boxing match ‘ is the public incarnation_0.529 of all conflict ’ ( II , 32 ) , totalizing in its own struggle_0.171 the whole of ‘ contemporary irreducibilities and fissures_0.618 ’ ( II , 26 ) :"
"cty-fragment03","551","thus one can and must say … that each fight is the singularisation of all the circumstances of the social whole in movement_-0.235 and that by this singularisation , it incarnates_0.727 the enveloping_0.333 totalization which the historical process is ."
"cty-fragment03","552","( II , 58 )"
"cty-fragment03","553","But then he adds , ‘ I have said and I repeat that we have not yet proved that this enveloping_0.394 totalization exists ’ ."
"cty-fragment03","554","So , although it is possible to conceive_0.265 of any event as an incarnation_0.314 of the totality , insofar as it must itself make_-0.242 up a part_-0.333 of that totality in its determination , unlike the case of the boxing match , where we can define_-0.1 the overall entity ‘ boxing ’ , it still remains unproven that an overall entity , ‘ History ’ , can be said to exist at all ."
"cty-fragment03","555","For all his use of the model_0.094 of the boxing match , Sartre has really got_-0.543 no further_-0.176 with the fundamental question of how there can be totalization without a totalizer ."
"cty-fragment03","556","It is simple enough for him to show_-0.257 that a boxing match takes_-0.152 place within a general totality of ‘ boxing ’ , which is itself only ever present in any individual incarnation_0.382 , for as a game each match is both an individual bout and something conducted_0.031 according to general rules_-0.121 and a specific social tradition ."
"cty-fragment03","557","But what about those conflicts that do not take_-0.235 place within such a constituted social system_0.29 , such as conflictual bourgeois societies which can not be said to be unified , except , as Sartre suggests_-0.152 dismissively , by appeal_0.03 to a lost_-0.233 paradise_0.182 before the class struggle_0.303 ?"
"cty-fragment03","558","Such societies make_-0.061 the conflicts of history irreducible to Sartre 's logic unless , like the boxing match , they can be shown_-0.257 to take_-0.382 part_-0.613 in a larger_0.143 totalizable category ."
"cty-fragment03","559","However , when he poses the question of whether his method could work_-0.061 as well for the class struggle_0.118 as for the boxing match , Sartre admits_-0.114 that he finds_-0.324 it impossible to answer and returns_-0.147 instead to the much easier case of sub-groups ."
"cty-fragment03","560","Once again he backtracks_0.206 and assumes_0.242 a larger_-0.091 unity in which conflict takes_-0.182 place ."
"cty-fragment03","561","The major question thus always remains unanswered in the Critique : every time that Sartre announces_-0.065 that he is about to proceed_0.091 with the fundamental problem of how History can be a totalization without a totalizer , he turns_-0.152 back to a previous , more easily intelligible stage_0.265 on the way_-0.265 ."
"cty-fragment03","562","His difficulty is accompanied_0.333 by a no doubt symptomatic_0.321 increasing distrust of universals so that , in championing specificities against them , he seems to give up the attempt to validate the universals — History as Totalization — that originally formed_0.3 the object_0.303 of his project ."
"cty-fragment03","563","At this point_-0.057 a further contradiction in Sartre 's whole_0.088 enterprise begins to open_-0.147 up : for someone so deeply_-0.028 distrustful of universals it seems curious that he has involved himself so emphatically with the notions of totality , History , and the dialectic ."
"cty-fragment03","564","As Sartre insists more and more upon the virtues_0.353 of specificity ( II , 200 — 05 ) , such is his distaste for Marxist or any other universalizing categories that he refuses even to countenance them , attempting to replace_-0.032 concepts with specificities , universals with singulars ."
"cty-fragment03","565","His scepticism goes_-0.176 to the extent_0.059 of even denying the existence of ‘ society ’ or ‘ the nation ’ as such ( II , 24 , 61 ) — the very totalities which his own general argument for totalization requires ."
"cty-fragment03","566","Here_0.189 certain similarities with later ‘ post-Marxist ’ theorists such as Foucault or Lyotard , begin to become apparent ."
"cty-fragment03","567","But if Sartre anticipates such later thinkers we should not assume_-0.31 too quickly_-0.353 that they have simply taken_-0.129 his insights further_0 ."
"cty-fragment03","568","For Sartre 's singular universal could never be expected to solve the formal_0.088 theoretical problem of how individual existential existence can be related to History insofar as it simply renames , in one oxymoronic category , the original antithetical terms ."
"cty-fragment03","569","Without an adequate theory of their articulation_0.529 , they simply begin to separate_0.206 again ."

"ea7-fragment03","796","This effectively restricted_0.091 their use to the wealthy and to those whose claim to assistance under the ban was incontrovertible ."
"ea7-fragment03","797","Equally , the improvements in fortification needed to withstand their effects — thick stone walls , inner as well as outer defences — required incomes greater than those of simple lords ."
"ea7-fragment03","798","The net_0.125 effect was that , given dedication , princes — Louis VI , Geoffrey le Bel , Alphonse-Jourdain — could subdue rebellious castellans within their own demesnes , and could build castles of their own which were impregnable to all but lengthy and sustained attack ."
"ea7-fragment03","799","Henry II 's castle at Chinon , where the treasury of Anjou was situated , was the model for its generation_0.086 , with its halls , upper chambers , tower , and curtain_0.364 walling , set on a high point above a strategic crossing of the Loire ."
"ea7-fragment03","800","It could be copied_-0.03 only either by those of nearly equal wealth or by those who could concentrate their resources chiefly on defence — princes , great_-0.029 bishops or , in the south especially , towns ."
"ea7-fragment03","801","All others became vulnerable ."
"ea7-fragment03","802","John of Salisbury 's comment that not only the towns but also the fortresses of Gaul feared_0.152 Henry I of England was revealing_0.206 of the new situation_0.029 ."
"ea7-fragment03","803","Similarly , campaigning in the field imposed an increasing_0.032 financial burden_0.091 ."
"ea7-fragment03","804","The treaty between Robert II of Flanders and Henry I of England , renewed by their successors , stipulated that each knight supplied_0.059 to the English king should bring three horses with him — this at a time when a horse represented a major investment ."
"ea7-fragment03","805","Then knightly armour grew_0.03 more elaborate and costly throughout the century ."
"ea7-fragment03","806","And though some knights might be supplied free_-0.2 by feudal service , household ones had to be maintained_0.111 by their lords , mercenary ones needed pay , and those with money-fiefs constituted a regular charge_0.03 on the treasury ."
"ea7-fragment03","807","Besides , away from their home base , knights were useless on their own ."
"ea7-fragment03","808","In open_-0.265 battle and in the plundering expeditions that constituted the normal form_-0.176 of aggressive warfare , they needed the backing_0.469 of archers , both mounted and on foot , and of numerous infantrymen ."
"ea7-fragment03","809","The usual source_-0.061 of supply was town militias — Suger mentions those of Rheims , Châlons , Laon , Soissons , Orléans , Etampes , and Paris in the royal army of 1124 ."
"ea7-fragment03","810","But they might have to be supplemented by mercenaries from Flanders and the Low Countries , where the rapidly expanding_0.265 population forced_0.147 large_-0.5 numbers of young men into military careers ."
"ea7-fragment03","811","In the eyes_-0.194 of the faithful , these ‘ Brabanters ’ , with their freebooting and lack of discipline after the end_-0.606 of campaigns , were as dangerous as heretics ; in 1171 Frederick Barbarossa and Louis VII agreed to expel them from their lands ."
"ea7-fragment03","812","Their value_0.176 in battle , as shields_0.114 behind which the knights could shelter_0.3 before they launched_0.438 their charge_0.273 , ensured their continued employment by those who could afford them — notably Henry II of England ."
"ea7-fragment03","813","But the hatred they aroused meant_-0.03 that they were liable_0.364 to be brutally slaughtered if captured afterwards ."
"ea7-fragment03","814","Inevitably , therefore , war on the grand scale_0.235 as fought by princes bore_0.029 little resemblance in practice to the feuds of lesser men ."
"ea7-fragment03","815","The divergence was sharpened_0.424 by the application_0.212 of a theoretical distinction , the fruit_0.6 of Augustinian theology , amplified_0.657 as the century went on by canon and Roman law reference ; princes pronounced their campaigns just wars ( fought against aggressors with the aim_-0.114 of re-establishing peace ) or public wars ( declared by a competent authority in the public interest ) , while they condemned the wars of lesser men as infractions of the peace ."
"ea7-fragment03","816","Geoffrey Martel had perceived_-0.303 the propaganda potential of public war as early as the mid eleventh century ; later it enabled Henry the Liberal of Champagne to claim the military service_-0.294 of all lords within his county , a reapplication_-0.065 of the Carolingian ban ."
"ea7-fragment03","817","So it could be a powerful weapon_0.206 ."
"ea7-fragment03","818","Yet the logic of the definition suggested_0.029 that it would benefit especially kings , whose competence to declare war could not be impugned : thus Thibaud of Blois failed to persuade the monks of Marmoutier that they owed him service_-0.057 when he fought against Louis VI ; they claimed discretion in the matter ; and in 1184 , the mighty Philip of Alsace hesitated to commit_0.324 to battle the army he had summoned against Philip Augustus , through fear that its ranks might melt_0.118 away_-0.03 ."
"ea7-fragment03","819","The contrast_0.182 with the united_0.182 front_-0.029 Louis VI and his troops presented to the emperor Henry V in 1124 was marked ."
"ea7-fragment03","820","A royal banner now bestowed_0.469 respectability on a cause_-0.143 ; kings ' wars were assumed_0.029 to be for the sake of peace , even when cripplingly_0.278 expensive and increasingly savage ."
"ea7-fragment03","821","This goes_-0.182 some way_-0.394 to explaining why the complicated_-0.029 campaigns within Toulouse in the second half_-0.081 of the century were largely fought out under the banners of the Angevin , Aragonese , and French kings ; and why the revolts of Henry II 's sons had widespread ramifications ."
"ea7-fragment03","822","The twelfth century was characterized , therefore , by fewer but more protracted wars , which smouldered_0.438 for long_-0.273 periods between short_-0.032 , sharp_0.303 bouts of conflict , like the war that covered_0.176 must of the reigns of Henry I of England and Louis VI of France , the one inaugurated_0.343 by the great_-0.303 rebellion of 1173 , which outlived_-0.065 both Louis VII and Henry II , or that against Catalan claims in the south ."
"ea7-fragment03","823","Into these large_-0.139 numbers of local conflicts were subsumed ."
"ea7-fragment03","824","The pattern_-0.03 caused problems , in that the circumstances which might trigger off renewed fighting were unpredictable ; yet the moment an opportunity offered_0.156 , princes had to be prepared for invading their enemies ; there was no time for lengthy preparation ."
"ea7-fragment03","825","The usual tactic was to march troops across the enemy 's territory , plundering and looting ; to take_-0.029 fortified places if the task was easy ; to obtain allies among the lords of the locality ; and to retreat without fighting a battle if at all possible — in effect an application_-0.028 to a wider_0 canvas_0.531 of the some technique of warfare which had earlier made_-0.387 castellans formidable in the immediate environs of their castles ."
"ea7-fragment03","826","It necessitated the rapid mobilization of auxiliaries to join_-0.394 a core_-0.171 of highly-trained troops kept constantly , at the ready — the princes ' military households_0.281 , which became the linch pin of the system_-0.182 ."
"ea7-fragment03","827","John of Marmoutier 's life of Geoffrey le Bel offers_-0.312 a glimpse_-0.114 of how strong_-0.324 bonds_0.176 were created between the prince and his followers within the household_0.344 , and how a high_-0.091 level_0.059 of training was maintained_0.062 at all times ."
"ea7-fragment03","828","Geoffrey was brought up from infancy with the sons of neighbouring Angevin lords , on whose companionship he relied ."
"ea7-fragment03","829","When it came_-0.206 time for him to be knighted by Henry I in Rouen , he set off for Normandy with a crowd of these young men about him ."
"ea7-fragment03","830","In Rouen , the occasion was celebrated with pomp , elaborate dress , and a great feast , and then the youths all demonstrated their military skill at a grand tournament , at which Geoffrey naturally_0.088 won the highest_-0.206 honours ."
"ea7-fragment03","831","It was within this kind of environment_0.29 that chivalry flourished_0.485 , that young men learned to identify , their vassalage towards their lord as a symbol_0.229 of their honour , that they debated_0.364 the relative merits of Roland 's and Oliver 's way_-0.382 of displaying_0.161 loyalty ; and that they learned the finer_0.118 points_0.088 of jousting ."
"ea7-fragment03","832","Tournaments were disapproved of by ecclesiastics , for they could be both bloody and dangerous ."
"ea7-fragment03","833","Yet they supplied real needs : ."
"ea7-fragment03","834","that of an instruction in the martial arts compatible with the maintenance_0.294 of a prince 's peace ; that of an outlet_0.147 for competitive instincts within the claustrophobic confines of a court ; and that of display to maintain_0.125 princely social status ."
"ea7-fragment03","835","So they flourished_0.257 everywhere ."
"ea7-fragment03","836","They offered_-0.121 opportunities for men of skill to acquire great_-0.1 position_0.235 in the world — Arnoul of Ardres caught_0.143 the eye_-0.382 of Countess Ida of Boulogne through his exploits ; and they also conferred lustre_0.344 on the great — Geoffrey le Bel and Philip of Alsace were throughout France for their distinguished performances in these show battles ."
"ea7-fragment03","837","All this formed a background_0.129 to the first century of crusading ; and it goes_-0.324 some way_-0.303 to explaining the more secular aspects_0 of the magnetism_0.455 which drew_0.343 French knights to take_-0.406 up the cross_0.294 in their thousands ."
"ea7-fragment03","838","Urban II , launching_-0.061 the First Crusade at Clermont in 1095 , presented_-0.065 it as a natural evolution of the peace movement_0.03 : warriors were to forget their petty feuds and squabbles in a campaign_0.031 to promote_0.152 the interests of Holy Church ."
"ea7-fragment03","839","The war , declared by one whose moral authority was unimpeachable , was to free_-0.152 the Eastern churches , to end Muslim guardianship_0.364 of the holy places , to restore_0 Jerusalem to its proper state ."
"ea7-fragment03","840","As princes saw_-0.182 it , it was a just war in the fullest_0.121 sense_-0.031 of the term_0 ; those who were slaughtered in its battles were regarded_0.171 as among the martyrs of the church ."
"ea7-fragment03","841","When Raymond of Toulouse , Robert II of Flanders , Robert Curthose , Stephen of Blois , and Hugh of Vermandois responded_-0.152 to the call_-0.061 , past and present members_0.059 of their military households_0.265 fell_-0.129 almost automatically_-0.118 into rank behind them , to test themselves against terrible dangers , but also to enjoy the companionship in arms , the adventure , the deeds of daring which were the stuff_0.088 of the chansons de geste ."
"ea7-fragment03","842","That they shared_-0.258 , along with all other participants in the crusade , a fervent devotion , a conviction_0.323 that their sins would be forgiven , is certain ."
"ea7-fragment03","843","Yet for them crusading necessitated no large_-0.121 leap_0.406 of the imagination , no millenarian vision_0.471 ; it was simply a challenging and a deserving extension_0.114 of their everyday activities ."
"ea7-fragment03","844","In French eyes_0.062 , the hero of the First Crusade was Robert II of Flanders ."
"ea7-fragment03","845","While Raymond of Toulouse remained in Outremer , Stephen and Hugh disgraced themselves in escaping from the siege of Antioch , and Robert Curthose , no matter how gallant , at least in his lifetime failed to impress_0.094 , Robert II 's prestige soared_-0.088 to the skies_0.086 ."
"ea7-fragment03","846","He became Robert of Jerusalem to his contemporaries ; his deeds were recorded in the Song of Antioch ; his pious bravery totally expunged_0.576 the memory of Robert the Frisian 's usurpation ; and after his death his son Baldwin VII harped_0.382 on his father 's achievement to justify his substantial use of coercion against the enemies of the church ."
"ea7-fragment03","847","Outside Flanders , Robert 's sister 's marriage to Roger of Sicily was a mark_-0.176 of his new position_0.03 in the world ; like Louis VI 's sister 's marriage to Bohemond of Antioch , it stretched_0.242 French kinship connections_0.281 into the new Norman colonies , ensuring that travellers from the homeland would find_-0.281 a welcome in those distant parts ."
"ea7-fragment03","848","Robert 's example was a potent one ."
"ea7-fragment03","849","After the next change_-0.147 in dynasty , Thierry and Philip of Alsace strengthened_0.412 their shaky_0.375 claim to the comital position_0.206 by attaining for themselves the prestige attached_0.235 to being the outstanding crusaders of their generation ."
"ea7-fragment03","850","Thierry 's remote_0.171 connection_0.212 with the family of Godfrey de Bouillon , along with his marriage with Sybilla of Anjou , Fulk V 's daughter , gave_-0.176 him some claim to the throne of Jerusalem ; as a consequence , the aristocracy of Outremer viewed_0.03 him and Philip with mixed_-0.147 feelings_-0.086 , expecting much of them , yet fearing their ambitions ."
"ea7-fragment03","851","In the end , it was not in Outremer but in the newly conquered Byzantine empire that the Flemish crusading achievement was crowned_0.061 with the elevation_0.364 of Count Baldwin IX to the imperial throne in 1204 ."
"ea7-fragment03","852","But in the twelfth century , the house of Alsace could afford the high_-0.343 costs of their expeditions — Thierry went to Jerusalem four times , Philip twice — and the counts ' repeated absences in fact promoted_0.125 administrative reform ; the baillis and the Grote Bref were as much the products_0.094 of crusading as the English and Norman judicial system_-0.147 and exchequers were the product_0.062 of the king-duke 's divided_0.057 attentions ."
"ea7-fragment03","853","But if , on balance_0.147 , the Flemish counts benefited materially from crusading , — as , arguably , did the Angevin — they were far from typical ."
"ea7-fragment03","854","For other French houses a commitment to Outremer often represented a sacrifice_0.125 of domestic political interest ."
"ea7-fragment03","855","The achievements of Raymond IV St Gilles in consolidating his authority within Toulouse were threatened_0.438 by his departure in 1095 , especially since it was known that he had no intention of returning home ."
"ea7-fragment03","856","Then his example lured_0.324 his elder son Bertrand to Tripoli in 1112 , and his younger son Alphonse Jourdain there in 1147 ."
"ea7-fragment03","857","Had not his grandson Raymond V fulfilled his crusading obligation in his early youth , thereby freeing_0.114 himself from the necessity_0.147 of interrupting his career in the county , the principality of Toulouse might have disintegrated_0.235 altogether ."
"ea7-fragment03","858","William IX 's crusade of 1101 brought about serious_0.333 financial problems in Aquitaine which caused rapid devaluation in the hitherto stable_-0.059 currency ; and Robert Curthose 's decision to mortgage Normandy to William Rufus in order to cover_-0.212 his crusading expenses exacerbated a conflict over the duchy which was not settled_-0.206 until the death of his son William Clito in 1128 ."
"ea7-fragment03","859","All in all , it was not surprising that Suger , mulling over the precedents of early crusading , tried_-0.129 to dissuade Louis VII from embarking_0.194 on his Jerusalem journey in 1145 ."
"ea7-fragment03","860","Yet the appeal_0.242 of crusading was , if anything , even stronger_0.273 to those aristocratic houses just below the level_-0.03 of the princely : it was , after all , the house of Boulogne which produced_-0.219 the first two rulers of Jerusalem ."
"ea7-fragment03","861","The counts of Nevers , the lords of Montpellier , the lords of Amboise and Lusignan , the Trencavels , were fervent devotees of the ideal ; so the problems of absences , shipwrecks , death abroad plagued them as much as their princes ."
"ea7-fragment03","862","On occasion , their determination_0.156 to sacrifice_0.242 for Christ played_0.062 directly_0.129 into their overlord 's hands_-0.083 , as when the count of La Marche , who had no direct_-0.176 heir , sold his county to King Henry II in 1177 ."
"ea7-fragment03","863","When it did not , accompanying their princes in a joint crusading venture , as the lord of Amboise accompanied Fulk V or Hugh VI de Lusignan William IX , created new personal links_-0.061 ."
"ea7-fragment03","864","The political spin-offs_0.206 from crusading are therefore more difficult to calculate_0.088 than at first glance_0 they might appear_-0.118 ."
"ea7-fragment03","865","Nevertheless it is clear_-0.406 that the chief_0.176 gainer was Louis VII ."
"ea7-fragment03","866","The irony of this lay_-0.091 in the fact that the Second Crusade was counter-productive in Outremer , embittered relations with Byzantium , and resulted in the deaths of enormous_0.097 numbers of its participants , particularly those drawn_0 from the non­aristocratic classes ."
"ea7-fragment03","867","Yet it consolidated the king 's position_0.286 within France , partly through the skilled regency of Suger , but also because , in taking on himself the leadership of the expedition , Louis re-emerged_0.118 as a credible ruler of men ."
"ea7-fragment03","868","His noble gesture_0.062 appeased those churchmen who had been appalled by his early obstinacy over the archbishopric of Bourges ."
"ea7-fragment03","869","The disasters that befell his army paradoxically heightened his personal charisma : even the barons of Outremer continued to look_-0.353 on him as their one potential saviour ."
"ea7-fragment03","870","His friendship with Raymond V of Toulouse , a fellow warrior , reversed_0.111 the trend of history since the middle_-0.176 of the tenth century , in bringing_-0.182 the princes of the far south back_-0.394 into the king 's mouvance ."
"ea7-fragment03","871","The crowds of Burgundians who accompanied the king learned to respect him ; on their return , they sought the arbitration of the royal court in their disputes , and they welcomed Louis 's intervention within the counties that fringed the duchy of Burgundy ."
"ea7-fragment03","872","As William of St Denis put_-0.452 it ,"
"ea7-fragment03","873","Even as early as 1147 it was apparent that the crusading movement_0.182 had provided a new sense_0.29 of aristocratic cohesion in the realm ."
"ea7-fragment03","874","The great joint expeditions , the combined leaderships , although not without friction_0.312 , had been justified by their outstanding achievement , the conquest and maintenance of Jerusalem ."

"ecv-fragment05","1044","They have received it in the shape_0.059 of detailed educational theory carefully worked out to see_-0.438 them through the maturation process from infancy to adulthood ."
"ecv-fragment05","1045","Generations of philosophers have documented this process ."
"ecv-fragment05","1046","Perhaps the best known version is Shakespeare 's seven ages of man which is a poetic statement of what had already been received wisdom for centuries and was to remain so for centuries to come_-0.441 ."
"ecv-fragment05","1047","Education was to guide_0.152 the infant through the transition to manhood including such stages_-0.03 as childhood , boyhood and youth ."
"ecv-fragment05","1048","That is the second thing_-0.294 to notice ; the philosopher 's children are boys ."
"ecv-fragment05","1049","The fact that at least half of the world 's children would not actually go_-0.441 through this process beyond the first two stages_0.029 is conveniently forgotten or ignored and , no doubt , the reasons for this were largely social ."

"ecv-fragment05","1051","Education has an end_-0.412 ."
"ecv-fragment05","1052","Although it is fashionable to talk about its value_-0.219 ‘ for its own sake ’ , what prompts_0.059 the theorising is the strong_-0.147 and well-founded belief that the experiences of childhood affect the kind of adult which the child turns_-0.176 out to be ."
"ecv-fragment05","1053","Where the end_0.194 is person- rather than role-oriented_0.182 — that is , where the end_-0.094 is the development of the human mind and spirit rather than the production_0.129 of , say , information technologists — then education is valued_0.143 in relation to some conception_0.265 of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to serve_-0.029 ."
"ecv-fragment05","1054","Such an ideal does not stand_-0.212 isolated_0.194 from the practices which strive_0.212 towards it but interacts_0.353 with those practices , helps_-0.031 to construct_0.294 them , and is in turn_-0.235 constructed_0.265 by them ."

"ecv-fragment05","1119","Children must be taken_-0.161 care of by others and protected from external injury_0.125 and against their own actions ."
"ecv-fragment05","1120","The traditional view_-0.143 is encapsulated_0.412 in the claim that children are not autonomous_0.5 ; that is , on a standard interpretation , they lack the capacity_0.235 to act rationally in pursuit of their own self-chosen goals_-0.188 ."
"ecv-fragment05","1121","It is then a matter of preference whether you say_-0.258 that they can not choose the goals_0 or that they can not form_-0.226 strategies to achieve them or both ."
"ecv-fragment05","1122","In either case , the political implication is that denying rights to children is entirely justified_0.206 , and there_-0.094 the matter rests_-0.059 ."

"ecv-fragment05","1127","The tension_0.182 between these theoretical views_-0.303 of children as non-rational , non-autonomous_0.429 beings and the practical knowledge of real children is evident in those quotations from Hobbes and Locke and Kant and Mill ."
"ecv-fragment05","1128","Children , according to Hobbes , have the ‘ possibility apparent ’ of becoming reasonable ."
"ecv-fragment05","1129","In what does the possibility consist ?"

"ecv-fragment05","1131","But what ?"
"ecv-fragment05","1132","Hobbes does not tell_-0.406 us , but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey does not have ."
"ecv-fragment05","1133","It is not language since Hobbes is here_-0.314 talking_-0.25 about the prelinguistic child ."

"ecv-fragment05","1136","In any case , if such a qualification is called_-0.118 for it is hard_-0.242 to see_-0.441 how a creature with no rationality at all could possess_0.235 it ."
"ecv-fragment05","1137","Locke 's remarks are just as puzzling ."
"ecv-fragment05","1138","Children are definitely not rational but love to be treated as if they were ."
"ecv-fragment05","1139","How is this possible ?"

"ecv-fragment05","1141","Perhaps he just means that they like the sound of my voice ?"
"ecv-fragment05","1142","Well , maybe they do , but making any old_-0.229 noises is clearly not sufficient to enter_-0.067 the rationality stakes_0.353 ; I must at least say_-0.344 something ."
"ecv-fragment05","1143","Is it just that I talk to them that they love ?"
"ecv-fragment05","1144","Maybe , but I can also , if I like , talk to my car , but yelling at it in the approved Basil Fawlty manner is hardly treating it as rational ."
"ecv-fragment05","1145","Lockean children have the added_-0.394 amazing ability to recognise_0.094 reason in you without possessing_0.061 any themselves , while Kantian kids , two stages_0.091 back from rationality , have the disconcerting habit_0.086 of getting puzzled and asking questions ."
"ecv-fragment05","1146","Mill 's minors are a little more complicated ."
"ecv-fragment05","1147","Part_0.088 of the time he sees_-0.455 them in the familiar way_-0.429 as creatures who lack rationality to at least some degree_-0.091 ."

"ecv-fragment05","1164","( Holt , 1974 , p. 16 )"
"ecv-fragment05","1165","This is also the view_-0.343 put forward by John Harris , though in less specific terms ."

"ecv-fragment05","1173","What , we may ask Holt , happens to the child who , dissatisfied at home , seeks in vain for guardians who would suit_0.294 him ?"
"ecv-fragment05","1174","What if no one wants him ?"
"ecv-fragment05","1175","Our papers are currently full_-0.235 of ‘ hard-to-place_-0.065 ’ children in local authority care advertising for foster or adoptive parents ."
"ecv-fragment05","1176","In such a situation_-0.206 the skilled care of social workers is crucial to ensuring that an unwanted by-product_0.273 of success for some children is not the total destruction_0.257 of self-esteem for others ."

"ecv-fragment05","1178","To impose such a test on children would be a particularly invidious way_-0.206 of discriminating against them , unless Harris has in mind that we should all undergo such examination ."

"ecv-fragment05","1180","These two suggestions , far_-0.152 from being enlightened liberation_0.516 of all children , are actually oppression of a deeply_-0.061 damaging_0.273 kind to at least some , and Harris 's suggestion contains_-0.091 a capacity_0.194 criterion in disguise_0.167 ."

"ecv-fragment05","1188","His view_-0.514 that letting children run in and out of busy airports smartly avoiding the traffic is perfectly reasonable depends upon a conception_0.294 of a child which is far_-0.455 narrower_0.379 than even the sex divide ."
"ecv-fragment05","1189","Holt 's child is actually the Artful_0.265 Dodger_0.471 ; mercifully , not all children are ."
"ecv-fragment05","1190","There are other difficulties too ."
"ecv-fragment05","1191","It is not clear_-0.152 whether or not Harris thinks that children of 10 should be obliged to take on full_-0.314 political status whether or not they want to , but Holt clearly does not ."

"ecv-fragment05","1193","If Holt thinks that this proposal would remove_0.059 an arbitrary boundary_0.229 line_-0.182 between adults and children , then he is mistaken ."
"ecv-fragment05","1194","The point_-0.207 about an adult citizen is that he has these rights , privileges , duties and responsibilities whether or not he wants them ."
"ecv-fragment05","1195","He may not exercise_0.147 his rights or he may shirk his duties , but he can not forgo them ."
"ecv-fragment05","1196","They are not just available to him , they are his ."

"ecv-fragment05","1198","Rights and privileges do not pose any particular problems in the case of children ."
"ecv-fragment05","1199","Holt can and does believe that children should have them as adults do , and then leaves_-0.229 it up to the child to decide whether or not to exercise_0.097 them ."
"ecv-fragment05","1200","But the same can not be said_-0.161 for duties and responsibilities ."
"ecv-fragment05","1201","Failure to exercise_0.156 one 's rights may be morally neutral ; failure to carry out one 's duties is not ."
"ecv-fragment05","1202","It would be perfectly possible to give_-0.406 the rights to children without imposing the duties on them , the one does not entail_0.206 the other , but we would then still be distinguishing_0.235 between adults and children as citizens ."

"ecv-fragment05","1204","Duties and responsibilities are not merely available to a citizen ; they are an integral_0.161 part_-0.188 of being a citizen ."
"ecv-fragment05","1205","Holt does not want children to be obliged to take on any of these responsibilities and he manages_0.029 to make_-0.257 his point_-0.229 by concentrating_0.029 solely on the rights so that he can remark :"
"ecv-fragment05","1206","I do not say_-0.176 , either , that these rights and duties should be tied_-0.121 into one package_-0.03 , that if a young person wants to assume any of them , he must assume them all ."

"ecv-fragment05","1210","Holt and Harris both , in the end_-0.206 , face_0 the same problem ."
"ecv-fragment05","1211","They attack_0.324 the status quo by pointing_-0.125 out that the reasons given_-0.194 for denying rights to children are bad reasons , and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duties for no reason at all ."

"ew1-fragment01","8","Two strong_-0.062 groups_0 emerged_0.412 behind Long and Chamberlain , about equal in numbers , but there were few backers for Carson or Law ."
"ew1-fragment01","9","Carson thereupon fell_-0.118 out of the contest — or rather announced_-0.091 that he was not standing_-0.121 , for no official nominations had been made_-0.438 ."
"ew1-fragment01","10","The party officers and Whips were solidly_0.147 behind Chamberlain , but Law drew_0.257 off some of his support_-0.188 among tariff reformers and , urged on by Edward Goulding and Max Aitken , he refused to withdraw_0.121 unless his continued candidature would allow_-0.324 Long to win ."
"ew1-fragment01","11","Against Chamberlain it was remembered that he was a Liberal Unionist ( as was Lansdowne , who led_-0.265 the Unionists in the Lords ) and that he had not been entirely loyal to Balfour since the referendum pledge_0.156 ."
"ew1-fragment01","12","Long was supported_-0.062 by the bulk_-0.088 of the English county members_0 but by few of the party 's men of talent ."
"ew1-fragment01","13","By the morning of Friday 10 November it was clear_-0.364 that neither Chamberlain nor Long would secure_0.029 a majority and that some supporters of each of them would not contentedly follow_-0.382 the other ."
"ew1-fragment01","14","A party meeting was to be held_-0.29 on the following_-0.242 Monday and the Whips were making_-0.029 preparation for a vote to be taken_-0.182 ."
"ew1-fragment01","15","Chamberlain provided the way_-0.2 out by suggesting to Balcarres that both he and Long should withdraw_-0.121 and so allow Law to be elected unanimously ; he also turned_-0.152 down Balcarres 's remarkable advice that he should allow Long to be elected since Long would make_-0.323 such a mess_0 of things_-0.147 that Chamberlain would be bound_0.212 to succeed within the year ."
"ew1-fragment01","16","Faced_-0.125 with Chamberlain 's proposition , and without a majority of his own , Long had no option but to agree ."
"ew1-fragment01","17","Bonar Law , backed_0.143 by fewer MPs than any of the other three contenders at the beginning of the week was now to be the unanimous choice ."
"ew1-fragment01","18","Robert Sanders reported the "" election "" meeting on 13 November with evident satisfaction :"
"ew1-fragment01","19","The Carlton meeting on Monday went_-0.118 off quite admirably ."
"ew1-fragment01","20","Harry Chaplin in the chair a very great_-0.229 success ."
"ew1-fragment01","21","A good many men came into the room by no means inclined_0.382 to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement_0.441 ."
"ew1-fragment01","22","Walter Long proposed Bonar Law ."
"ew1-fragment01","23","His speech was one of the best things_-0.364 I have heard ."
"ew1-fragment01","24","Manly_0.061 and rather touching ."
"ew1-fragment01","25","The country gentleman at his best ."
"ew1-fragment01","26","He spoke and evidently felt_-0.242 strongly_-0.061 of the degradation that it would have been to the parry to have elected a leader by secret ballot ."
"ew1-fragment01","27","Austen followed_-0.031 ."
"ew1-fragment01","28","When Austen sat down Chaplin suggested that he had better put_-0.25 the question at once and on getting_-0.143 an affirmative shout did so ."
"ew1-fragment01","29","A clever_-0.139 way_-0.324 of stifling_0.303 discussion and few could have done it so well ."
"ew1-fragment01","30","Motion_0.152 carried_0.206 unanimously ."
"ew1-fragment01","31","Bonar Law then sent for …"
"ew1-fragment01","32","His speech struck_0.176 me as the feeblest_0.588 of the day ."
"ew1-fragment01","33","He was evidently moved_-0.441 and nervous ."
"ew1-fragment01","34","The meeting separated_0.065 in great_-0.419 content with the Conservative Party all round ."
"ew1-fragment01","35","It was certainly creditable ."
"ew1-fragment01","36","The urgency of the events following_-0.121 Balfour 's resignation was due to the need to find a new leader before the National Union Conference ."
"ew1-fragment01","37","So within a few days of his grudging acceptance by his parliamentary colleagues , Law 's leadership was ratified_0.265 by the throng of party notables at Leeds ; here he received a reception more typical of what was to come_-0.111 in the future ."
"ew1-fragment01","38","In 1911 Law was known — in so far as he was known at all in the parliamentary party — as a spirited debater ."
"ew1-fragment01","39","A. ) ."
"ew1-fragment01","40","P. Taylor has noted_-0.061 that Law was trained_0.091 , if he was trained_-0.118 for anything in his early career , to be a debater ."
"ew1-fragment01","41","In Glasgow he had picked_0 up many of the skills that a more highly-born politician might have acquired_0.147 in the Oxford Union or at the Bar , but skills that were very different in appearance_0.029 ."
"ew1-fragment01","42","His concern was solely with effectiveness rather than style ; he rarely spoke with more than brief_0.152 notes and left_-0.121 it to the occasion to furnish_0.294 the words ."
"ew1-fragment01","43","( When he became Chancellor of the Exchequer this practice caused consternation at the Treasury , when he used only a page of notes to assist_-0.229 him in moving_-0.176 complicated_-0.029 resolutions on wartime finance ; he relied successfully on his memory to provide details_0 and figures . )"
"ew1-fragment01","44","As an extempore speaker he was able to tailor his words to his audience 's reactions_0.029 and so convey_0.452 the impression_-0.091 of personal conversation even when addressing thousands ."
"ew1-fragment01","45","In parliament he was wont to abandon_0 an argument half-completed if he sensed that his point_-0.094 had been made_-0.294 ; the speeches that appear_-0.353 in Hansard were touched_0.324 up by his staff , and his speeches in the country were given to the press in advance_0.03 ."
"ew1-fragment01","46","In debate he was a formidable opponent , and one that Asquith was never able to master , for all his forensic skills ."
"ew1-fragment01","47","Again Law succeeded by unorthodoxy ; he was quick_-0.1 to grasp_0.219 the essentials_0.097 of an opponent 's argument and quite prepared to be rude_-0.031 or direct_0.059 if the situation_-0.114 demanded_-0.031 it ."
"ew1-fragment01","48","In the long_-0.061 debates over Marconi in 1913 and over the Curragh "" mutiny "" in 1914 Law was able to nail_0.219 Asquith 's evasions where a more polished_0.353 stylist might have been foiled ."
"ew1-fragment01","49","Occasionally , in the onrush_0.485 of pursuit_0.424 , he gave_-0.294 commitments that were later regretted , but these were a small_-0.441 price_-0.229 to pay_-0.424 ."
"ew1-fragment01","50","The Unionist recovery_0 was built_0 around Law 's leadership , but what Asquith called the "" new_-0.176 style "" of obstruction_0.371 , threats and offensive_0.176 behaviour did not originate with Law ."
"ew1-fragment01","51","The beginnings are to be found_-0.091 in the diehard campaign_0.031 against the Parliament Bill ."
"ew1-fragment01","52","It was in June 1911 that the first scenes_0 of disorder were mounted_0.182 in the House of Commons , led_-0.091 by Lord Hugh Cecil ."
"ew1-fragment01","53","In August 1911 the diehard peers used language as violent_-0.029 as any that Law was to use later , and in the crucial decision on the House of Lords Law sided with the hedgers rather than the ditchers_0.194 ."
"ew1-fragment01","54","Ulster 's opposition to Home Rule long pre-dated Law 's leadership and he had rarely even spoken on Irish affairs in parliament before becoming leader ."
"ew1-fragment01","55","Before he succeeded Balfour then , Law was not associated with any of the features_0.258 that were to characterize_0.314 his party leadership ; his contribution_0.2 was to use the leadership in the service_0 of all of these causes , to make_-0.2 himself the spokesman for the most spirited_0.059 sections_-0.031 of the party ."
"ew1-fragment01","56","Law conceived of the role_-0.029 of the leader in an exactly opposite_0.091 sense_-0.257 from Balfour : he sought_0.114 to foster_0.294 unity by placing_0.062 himself at the head_-0.094 of the discordant_0.548 elements_0.412 where Balfour had thrown_0.086 the leadership on the side_-0.294 of restraint_0.371 ."
"ew1-fragment01","57","Their respective positions_0 explain_-0.029 this in part : as ex-Prime Minister and a considerable figure in his own right , Balfour had the confidence to believe in his own judgement even when isolated_0.294 from the bulk_0.257 of the party ; as the tertium quid in the recent contest , Law had neither the weight_0.387 nor the confidence to take_-0.438 such a detached_0.147 view_-0.333 ."
"ew1-fragment01","58","His strategy_-0.029 was rather to canalize_0.639 the enthusiasm of the diehards into party channels_0.061 , to articulate_0.265 their views_-0.061 , and to create unity from the sense_0.229 of movement_0.061 ."
"ew1-fragment01","59","In his characteristic phrase , "" I am their leader , I must follow_-0.229 them "" — but he determined to follow_0.061 them from the front_-0.312 ."
"ew1-fragment01","60","As a result of this he was labelled_0.182 as a diehard and a bigot , when he actually distrusted the diehards and was himself distrusted by the bigots ."
"ew1-fragment01","61","Much of his leadership was thus a form_-0.176 of pragmatic extremism , extreme_0.061 action_-0.176 and the threat of more extreme action_-0.062 to come_-0.314 , but used in the cause of more limited objectives ."
"ew1-fragment01","62","He certainly held_-0.333 deep_-0.382 convictions_0.118 as to the absolute wrongness of the Liberal policies that he opposed , but at least a part_-0.094 of his apparent hostility_0.514 was assumed_-0.067 for the occasion , a hard_0 line_-0.029 that might secure_0.059 a better compromise in the end_-0.303 ."
"ew1-fragment01","63","So in his first major speech as leader in parliament he wasted little time on the customary compliments and warned_-0.061 the government that he intended to play_-0.057 hard_0.097 ."
"ew1-fragment01","64","In private conversation he told Asquith "" I am afraid that I shall have to show_-0.206 myself very vicious_0.171 Mr Asquith this session ."
"ew1-fragment01","65","I hope you will understand . """
"ew1-fragment01","66","In later conversations about Ulster , Law was frank enough to point_0.088 out that bloodshed in Ulster would be the best way_-0.375 of ensuring an electoral landslide_0.303 for the Unionists ."
"ew1-fragment01","67","There was then an open_-0.235 toughness_0.265 about party tactics_0.206 ; before the Buckingham Palace Conference in 1914 he had Central Office work_-0.212 out the electoral effects of excluding_0.294 nine , six or four counties of Ulster from an independent Ireland the concern of a calculating pragmatist not of a bigot ."
"ew1-fragment01","68","From the party viewpoint_-0.059 Law 's methods were successful_-0.059 but dangerous_0.029 ; expectations raised_0.147 when the party was in full_-0.147 cry_0.206 were not easily set_0 aside_0.029 for an eventual compromise , and the only outcome that would fully vindicate the methods was the recovery_0.152 of power_0.062 ."
"ew1-fragment01","69","The basis of recovery_0.219 was then Law 's fighting_0.143 capacities_0.206 as leader ."
"ew1-fragment01","70","In parliament there would be a carefully organized campaign_0.438 of resistance_0.062 that would at least slow_-0.382 the government down and raise_-0.235 Unionist morale ."
"ew1-fragment01","71","Improved morale would also make_-0.206 possible organizational advances_0.032 outside parliament , all linked_-0.062 to the issue of Ulster , and with the sights_-0.091 fixed_0.121 firmly_0.097 on the next election , an election that would make_-0.161 or break_-0.121 the Union , the Empire and Law 's leadership of the party ."
"ew1-fragment01","72","All was linked_0.065 to the sense_-0.147 of a new_-0.394 departure_0.471 , a "" new_-0.371 style "" , a "" new_-0.375 regime in politics "" and a new team_-0.03 at the helm_0.235 : as well as a new leader , the party had by the middle_0.062 of 1912 a new Chief Whip , Party Chairman , party treasurer , principal agent , press adviser , and an almost entirely new team_-0.333 of Whips and organizers ."
"ew1-fragment01","73","Party organization provided the easiest advances_0.312 because it was the only area_-0.353 entirely under the party 's control_-0.061 ."
"ew1-fragment01","74","No general election was fought_-0.03 by the organization set_-0.457 up after 1911 , but there is little doubt that there was a massive_-0.188 improvement ; criticisms that were commonplace in 1910 were not to be heard_-0.182 by 1913 ."
"ew1-fragment01","75","The space available to Central Office was increased by the acquisition of St Stephen 's House as well as St Stephen 's Chambers , which had been occupied since 1874 ; the new office cost $3,000 a year in rent alone_-0.182 ."
"ew1-fragment01","76","The quality of the senior_0.258 staff was improved by the appointment of three specialists ."
"ew1-fragment01","77","John Boraston took over as Principal Agent in 1912 , having been a professional organizer all his career and latterly chief agent to the Liberal Unionist Council ."
"ew1-fragment01","78","He joined_-0.031 William Jenkins , appointed chief organizing agent in 1911 and previously district agent for the Midlands Liberal Unionists ."
"ew1-fragment01","79","The party was indeed handed_0.088 over to Birmingham ."
"ew1-fragment01","80","Finally , Malcolm Fraser , ex-editor of the Standard and of the Daily Express became first honorary press adviser and subsequently was employed to run_-0.242 the press bureau at the colossal salary of £1,200 ."
"ew1-fragment01","81","Steel-Maitland , Boraston , Jenkins and Fraser made up a team_-0.062 of experts , all of sufficient status to deal_-0.143 with politicians who might call into the office ; the work_-0.094 of the office was departmentalized for the first time and the heads_0.114 of department brought_0.265 together_-0.529 into a supervising board ."
"ew1-fragment01","82","The influence of Central Office toned_0.235 up the rest of the organization ."
"ew1-fragment01","83","A new_-0.125 canvass system_-0.25 was introduced_-0.118 in 1911 so that all county constituencies would operate_0.057 the same system_-0.152 and so that duplicate records could be kept_-0.176 at area_-0.273 level_0.059 ."
"ew1-fragment01","84","This was important at a time when outvoters were a larger group_-0.182 in many constituencies than the size of the majority and when the outvoters were overwhelmingly Unionist ."
"ew1-fragment01","85","In 1914 a register of car owners was compiled , also important when some voters could cast_-0.094 several votes in an election when polling went_-0.235 several days ."
"ew1-fragment01","86","By November 1912 only fifty-one constituencies in Great Britain were without candidates , a much better position_0.176 than the position_-0.059 at dissolution in either 1909 or 1910 ; few of these fifty-one constituencies were winnable , but in any case most of them had candidates by the end_-0.206 of 1913 ."
"ew1-fragment01","87","A programme of speakers for a general election was also ready_-0.406 by 1913 , with both constituencies and politicians told in advance_0.121 what they might expect_-0.323 ."
"ew1-fragment01","88","The financial mismanagement that had reigned_0.528 before 1911 was ended with the employment of professional accountants ."
"ew1-fragment01","89","Expenditure on Central Office , district offices and the London office doubled_-0.088 from £32,466 in 1909–10 to $68,957 in 1913–14 ; the total expenditure of the party organization from central_-0.029 funds also doubled_0.086 from $73,000 to over_-0.5 £150,000 ."
"ew1-fragment01","90","To pay for this outpouring , a great_-0.235 drive_-0.111 was mounted_0.419 for additional income -by Farquhar and Steel-Maitland ."
"ew1-fragment01","91","In 1912 ordinary subscriptions still brought_-0.094 in only £12000 a year and it proved difficult to raise_-0.226 them to anything like what was needed ."
"ew1-fragment01","92","The method adopted_-0.188 was to canvass for capital donations that could then be invested to bring_-0.281 in a regular_-0.118 income , and both Balfour and Law were used to raise_0.229 the wind_0.143 ."
"ew1-fragment01","93","Steel-Maitland told Balfour that "" Farquhar and I are endeavouring to raise_-0.062 more money ."
"ew1-fragment01","94","I think we are likely to succeed — thanks in part to the very generous example set_-0.441 by Lord Rothschild ."
"ew1-fragment01","95","But I would b , e very glad if I might see you on your return to ask you to help me in two cases ."
"ew1-fragment01","96","Systematic collections were made_-0.323 from peers and from the City ; by the outbreak of war the invested funds amounted to $671,000 — twice the sum in 1911 and worth four years "" expenditure — and there was a special cash deposit_-0.091 of £120,000 for the coming election ."
"ew1-fragment01","97","In three other areas_-0.25 , as much political as organizational , advances_-0.059 were made_-0.545 towards the management of the press , the coordination_0.156 of the heterogeneous collection that made up the party , and the fostering_0.457 of modern attitudes_0.188 in the local parties ."
"ew1-fragment01","98","Under Malcolm Fraser the party began_-0.394 to make_-0.559 effective use of its support_-0.091 in Fleet Street ."
"ew1-fragment01","99","It had been recognized_-0.091 that Liberals had been more adept at handling_0.226 the press because they were more ready to stoop_0.312 to newspaper practices , as Sandars had reported in 1909 :"
"ew1-fragment01","100","I told Northcliffe that if his people would make_-0.312 enquiries at our Central Office , he would find_-0.324 that our nightly regiment_0.6 of speakers was at least as well worth reporting as the Radical contingent_0.485 , but that I realized that from the Press point_-0.273 of view_-0.182 , no doubt , our speakers did not play up to the reporters by> handing_0.029 them their speeches in advance_-0.062 , and by other tricks of the kind to which the Radical orators have recourse ."
"ew1-fragment01","101","This was the essence_0.394 of the problem : the press could only be managed_0 by someone who knew their methods and who would not expect them to come round to Central Office to search_-0.065 for news ."
"ew1-fragment01","102","The UOC found_-0.235 that "" it is patent that some feeling_-0.118 exists among the Unionist Press that , while in the past they have done much for the Party , the Party has not assisted_-0.029 in their work ."
"ew1-fragment01","103","In many quarters_-0.091 it is asserted that the Unionist Press are treated with greater_-0.057 courtesy by the Radicals than by their own side_-0.394 . """
"ew1-fragment01","104","Fraser dealt_-0.091 with this problem without difficulty and explained to Law in 1913 that "" the importance of getting important speeches in advance_0.176 is shown_-0.382 in concrete_0.121 manner by your Wallsend speech on October 29th ."
"ew1-fragment01","105","The verbatim reports reached_-0.031 most of the newspapers in places such as Aberdeen at one o "" clock in the morning of the 30th . """
"ew1-fragment01","106","He went_-0.306 on to quote the response that had been received from editors :"
"ew1-fragment01","107","Manchester Dispatch : I hope you will continue this form_-0.152 of enterprise ."
"ew1-fragment01","108","You fully know as an old_-0.125 pressman the difficulty of dealing_0 with a big_-0.333 speech late at night …"
"ew1-fragment01","109","Daily Express : I am much obliged to you for the precis of Mr Bonar Law 's speech last night ."
"ew1-fragment01","110","It was a great_-0.094 help to us ."
"ew1-fragment01","111","The speech came_-0.333 over the wires so late and the sheets_0.265 were so confused by the Post Office — which is usual in these cases — that without the precis we could not possibly have got the leader_0.235 through in time for the first edition ."
"ew1-fragment01","112","So in the supply of information to newspapers predisposed_0.471 to support_-0.114 the party , much was achieved merely by employing a specialist ."
"ew1-fragment01","113","The other side_-0.273 of press management , depending on informal contacts_0.235 , is less easy to assess_-0.062 ."
"ew1-fragment01","114","In 1911 Steel-Maitland invited Blumenfeld of the Daily Express to Central Office for a two-way exchange_-0.235 of ideas and advice ."
"ew1-fragment01","115","He also used Law himself to impress_-0.061 editors who were on less familiar terms with Fraser , as with Marlowe of the Daily Mail , and Law took_-0.265 a direct_-0.091 interest in negotiations with the most difficult of all the Unionist editors , J. L. Garvin of the Observer ."
"ew1-fragment01","116","Law personally conducted_0.03 the negotiations with Gardner Sinclair over the sale of the Observer and the Pall Mall Gazette in 1914 ; this negotiation also demonstrates_0.03 that , as well as producing_0.03 information and nursing_0.303 editors , the party had to work_-0.242 hard_-0.324 to keep some of the newspapers in business ."
"ew1-fragment01","117","Sinclair did buy the Observer and the Pall Mall in the end_-0.471 , but not before he had been given_-0.5 a $45,000 guarantee from party funds ."
"ew1-fragment01","118","Such investments had a double_-0.091 purpose , for they could bring_-0.312 in income and provide a political bonus_-0.059 ."
"ew1-fragment01","119","One such scheme involved the purchase of the Daily Express by Max Aitken with party funds , but the party was also propping_0.629 up the Globe , the Standard , and a wide_-0.147 range_0.059 of provincial dailies ."
"ew1-fragment01","120","All these transactions were secret , for there would be little use in keeping a paper alive_-0.3 if it were known to be owned_-0.031 by a political party ."
"ew1-fragment01","121","The papers were therefore bought through nominees or bank loans backed_-0.033 with party capital ."
"ew1-fragment01","122","It was usual to extract_0 some form_-0.156 of guarantee in exchange_-0.156 for party support_-0.188 but the secrecy prevented such undertakings from being enforced ."
"ew1-fragment01","123","Sinclair thus gave_-0.371 an undertaking that his papers would always remain Unionist , but Steel-Maitland doubted if such a promise had any value_-0.375 ."
"ew1-fragment01","124","The later history of the Daily Express suggests_-0.029 not : when the Express became hostile_0.152 in the 1920s , Younger raged "" when I think of the large_0.125 sum of money this office has put_-0.697 into that gutter_0.424 print it makes_-0.286 my blood boil_0.235 "" ."
"ew1-fragment01","125","The justification_-0.031 for pouring_-0.061 out large_0 sums without a certain return_-0.059 was the even greater_-0.176 cost of any real alternative ."
"ew1-fragment01","126","The support_-0.219 for the Express in 1912 "" provides for the introduction of £50,000 or $60,000 to retain the only half-penny paper the Party possesses_0.559 in London , and no less a sum than $700,000 to £1 , 000,000 would be necessary to start a similar paper if the Daily Express were allowed_0 to go_-0.114 ."
"ew1-fragment01","127","The struggle_-0.091 therefore went_-0.562 on to keep the Unionist press alive_-0.091 , and in 1912 and 1913 both Aitken and Northcliffe stood_-0.114 by the party and gave_-0.233 valuable_0.147 support_-0.057 in their papers ."
"ew1-fragment01","128","The coordination_0.156 of competing party bodies_0.129 was carried out with surprising ease ."
"ew1-fragment01","129","The National Union was merged with Central Office in 1911 and fusion_0.618 with the Liberal Unionists followed_0.065 in 1912 ."
"ew1-fragment01","130","Joseph Chamberlain retained his preference for independence but allowed himself to be overruled_0.303 by Austen and by the overwhelming wishes_-0.094 of the Liberal Unionist Council to merge ."
"ew1-fragment01","131","To cater_0.133 for all susceptibilities , the party became the "" National Unionist Association of Conservative and Unionist Associations "" — a decision that allowed_0.176 some local parties to go_-0.286 on calling themselves Conservative , but the name "" Liberal "" was at last dropped_-0.029 ."
"ew1-fragment01","132","The Liberal Unionists were admitted_0 to the Carlton Club and a longstanding source_-0.03 of tension_0.086 was eradicated ."
"ew1-fragment01","133","This was in itself a striking commentary_0.25 on what had already been done : Liberal Unionists who had resisted_0.143 amalgamation under Balfour and Acland-Hood in 1911 acquiesced meekly under Law and Steel-Maitland in 1912 ."
"ew1-fragment01","134","Other organizations could not be absorbed_0.438 but could still be brought_-0.219 within the Central Office orbit_0.176 ."

"faj-fragment17","1716","Her face , as she removes her hat and begins to speak , is startlingly beautiful , although not conventionally ."

"faj-fragment17","1733","He had to collect the cattle and make_-0.067 sure that every boma was contributing his fair_-0.121 share ."
"faj-fragment17","1734","His district stretches_-0.091 nearly one hundred and fifty miles ."
"faj-fragment17","1735","I liked him , even though he was a little bit boring ."
"faj-fragment17","1736","He was so English ."
"faj-fragment17","1737","He could not speak Masai so he always was accompanied by this man , a Nandi , who , I am afraid , does not speak Masai very good . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1738","‘ Very well ."
"faj-fragment17","1739","Sorry . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1740","‘ Very well ."
"faj-fragment17","1741","So the laibon 's son from up there_-0.333 , up the valley past Lengai , he is a descendant of Mbatian , the great_-0.265 laibon , he tries to persuade Turnbull to let him take out his animal from the ones which have been selected . ‘"
"faj-fragment17","1742","The young warrior , Tepilit , is arguing with the district officer ."

"faj-fragment17","1745","On his head he wears a head-dress of lion mane ."
"faj-fragment17","1746","Turnbull explains through the interpreter that time is short_-0.235 ; it is late ; there is a great_-0.242 war on with the Germans ."
"faj-fragment17","1747","He can not wait for the proposed exchange of animals ."

"faj-fragment17","1753","Tell him that I am very sorry but I can not make_-0.441 exceptions ."

"faj-fragment17","1755","The Masai warrior , Tepilit , is excited ."
"faj-fragment17","1756","A number of other Masai gather round ."
"faj-fragment17","1757","He says that this particular animal is a favourite ."
"faj-fragment17","1758","He strokes its side , which is white and marked with round patches of black , like islands_0.121 on a naïvely_0.394 drawn_0.121 map_0.059 ."
"faj-fragment17","1759","It is a beautiful animal , with huge , curved horns ."
"faj-fragment17","1760","‘ I will bring you two cattle tomorrow ."

"faj-fragment17","1762","‘ Tell him I am very sorry , but I must fill_-0.441 the quota . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1763","Turnbull busies himself with his clipboard as his reply is translated ."
"faj-fragment17","1764","‘ Take the animal now , ’ he says to his assistant gently ."
"faj-fragment17","1765","As they move forward , Tepilit , without warning , hurls his spear at the district officer from a few feet away ."
"faj-fragment17","1766","It is a heavy weapon ."
"faj-fragment17","1767","Between the knife-shaped iron blade and the tapered tail_0.121 of the spear is a rounded handle made from a particularly hard tree ."
"faj-fragment17","1768","This piece of wood passes right through Turnbull , so that he is skewered ."

"faj-fragment17","1785","From a distance we see Tepilit , walking steadily towards Ol Doinyo Lengai with his animals ."

"fef-fragment03","622","3 ."
"fef-fragment03","623","Steady_0.029 currents_0.353"
"fef-fragment03","624","3.1 ."
"fef-fragment03","625","The basic equations"
"fef-fragment03","626","IN this chapter we shall be concerned with phenomena in which the main role_-0.485 is played_-0.147 by the current_-0.088 of charged_0 particles ."
"fef-fragment03","627","All our variables can be functions_0.188 of space but are independent of time ."
"fef-fragment03","628","It is easy to present_0.121 the relevant equations ; we have all of eqns ( 1.1 ) -(1.7) but have to substitute_-0.086 a/at = O , yielding_0.206 formula ."
"fef-fragment03","629","There is a difficulty with eqn ( 3.6 ) ."
"fef-fragment03","630","It is correct for most of the chapter with formula taken_-0.062 as a constant but breaks_0.147 down for ferromagnetic materials , which will be discussed in Section_-0.031 3.11 ."
"fef-fragment03","631","All the other equations are all right but will not necessarily provide the simplest_0.062 starting_-0.312 point_-0.394 for solving a given problem ."
"fef-fragment03","632","We shall , therefore , introduce_-0.176 a number of alternative formulations_0.258 ."
"fef-fragment03","633","First , we could search_-0.059 for some analogue of the potential_0.242 function_0.094 which proved so useful in electrostatics ."
"fef-fragment03","634","We found_-0.121 there_-0.147 that by choosing a scalar_0.371 function_0.176 in the form_-0.088 formula we could automatically_0.219 satisfy_0.294 the other equation for the electric field_-0.152 strength_0.032 , formula ."
"fef-fragment03","635","Can we do the same thing_-0.333 for the magnetic quantities ?"
"fef-fragment03","636","No , but we can do a similar thing_-0.2 ."
"fef-fragment03","637","Since it is the equation formula that needs to be satisfied_0.059 , we should choose the potential_0.529 as a vector ( called_-0.088 , not without logic , the vector potential_0.514 ) , defined_-0.226 by the equation formula ."
"fef-fragment03","638","Substituting_0.188 the above_-0.029 equation into eqn ( 3.1 ) we get_-0.471 formula , or using the vector relation ( eqn ( A.6 ) ) we obtain_0.219 the modified form_0.061 formula ."
"fef-fragment03","639","This equation can be further_-0.088 simplified to formula by choosing ( in the physicist 's jargon this is called_-0.147 choosing the gauge_0.206 ) formula ."
"fef-fragment03","640","Can we do that ?"
"fef-fragment03","641","One ca n't usually assign_-0.029 some arbitrary value_0.1 to the divergence of a vector function_0.062 ."
"fef-fragment03","642","In the present_0.03 case , however , we do have some freedom_-0.156 of choice ."
"fef-fragment03","643","The definition of A by eqn ( 3.8 ) is not unique ."
"fef-fragment03","644","If we add to A the gradient_0.294 of a scalar_0.03 function_-0.118 , the resulting vector A' still gives_-0.303 the same magnetic field_0 because formula ."
"fef-fragment03","645","Hence a suitable choice of will ensure that formula ."
"fef-fragment03","646","So we are left_-0.371 with eqn ( 3.11 ) ."
"fef-fragment03","647","If the current_-0.056 density_0.121 is specified , eqn ( 3.11 ) will provide the solution for A from which B can be determined ."
"fef-fragment03","648","How can we find_-0.438 a solution for A ?"
"fef-fragment03","649","There is nothing easier ."
"fef-fragment03","650","We only need to remember the differential equation for the scalar_0.613 potential_0.088 formula ( eqn ( 2.12 ) ) and its solution in the form_-0.333 of eqn ( 2.24 ) ."
"fef-fragment03","651","By analogy the general solution of eqn ( 3.11 ) is formula ."
"fef-fragment03","652","A simple_0.029 integration_0.235 will yield_0.219 A if J is given_-0.114 ."
"fef-fragment03","653","We shall go_-0.364 through a number of examples later ."
"fef-fragment03","654","For the moment let us use the above_-0.242 expression_0.212 for deriving_0.364 Biot-Savart 's law_-0.121 ."
"fef-fragment03","655","First we shall assume_-0.212 that the current_-0.091 density_0.171 is confined to a thin wire in which case the integration_0.176 variable may be changed to formula , where S is a vector normal to the cross-section , formula is the area of the cross-section , and dI is an elementary vector along the tangent of the wire ."
"fef-fragment03","656","Noting further_-0.088 that J.S = I and that I must be constant_0.229 along the wire we may write eqn ( 3.15 ) in the modified form_0.029 formula , whence the magnetic field_-0.121 strength_-0.152 is formula ."
"fef-fragment03","657","We have to stop_-0.258 here_-0.629 for a moment to sort_-0.278 out the coordinates ."
"fef-fragment03","658","As may be seen in Fig. 3.1 the coordinates of the wire element are x' , y' , z' , whereas the coordinates of the point where we wish to determine the magnetic field_0.031 are set of coordinates ."
"fef-fragment03","659","Thus the curl_0.242 operates_-0.167 on the coordinates of P but not on those of dl leading_0 to formula where ir is the unit vector in the direction r and we have made_-0.281 use of the vector relation ( A3 ) in the Appendix ."
"fef-fragment03","660","This is Biot-Savart 's law_-0.065 derived_0.2 directly_-0.152 from Maxwell 's equations ."
"fef-fragment03","661","Are there any other ways_-0.387 of determining the magnetic field_0.188 ?"
"fef-fragment03","662","Well , one can use eqn ( 3.1 ) as it is , but very often one is better off by using its integral form_-0.091 that can be obtained_0.147 by integrating_0.281 both sides_-0.029 of eqn ( 3.1 ) over a surface formula ."
"fef-fragment03","663","By using_-0.375 Stokes ' theorem for the left-hand-side_0.219 and recognizing that the integral of the current_0.188 density_0.265 gives_-0.229 the current_0 , the above_-0.441 equation reduces_0.091 to formula , where the line_-0.057 integration_0.265 is along the curve C enclosing the surface ."
"fef-fragment03","664","The positive_0.161 sense_0.235 of the integration_0.219 path_0.062 is defined relative to the positive_-0.152 current_-0.118 direction according to the usual right-hand_0.324 convention_0.375 ."
"fef-fragment03","665","Equation 3.21 ) is known as Ampère 's law_-0.031 ."

"fef-fragment03","671","If one manages_0.219 to find_-0.364 the simplest_-0.188 method at the first attempt that can mostly be attributed to good luck ."
"fef-fragment03","672","Can we claim then_-0.406 that the vector potential_0.235 is as useful as its scalar_0.647 counterpart in electrostatics ?"
"fef-fragment03","673","For computational purposes the answer is an unambiguous no ."
"fef-fragment03","674","It is always laborious to find_-0.286 the components_0.303 of a vector , so we are not much better off with A than with H or B. It turns out however that A is a more basic quantity_0.176 of physics than B. Since B is given_-0.382 by the curl_0.344 of A it is possible that A is finite while its curl_0.182 is zero ."
"fef-fragment03","675","Interestingly , under these conditions A has an effect on certain quantum-mechanical phenomena"
"fef-fragment03","675a","It would be unfair both to the vector potential_0.312 and to quantum mechanics to say_-0.441 that none of those formulations_0.206 have engineering applications_0 ( in fact the most sensitive_0 magnetometer built to date is based_-0.156 on that kind of theory ) , but by and large engineers would n't lose_-0.242 much sleep if the use of A were banned_0.176 with immediate_0.094 effect_-0.294 ."
"fef-fragment03","676","The vector potential_0.121 is not a popular_-0.118 variable among engineers , maybe because it is not directly_-0.03 measurable ."
"fef-fragment03","677","There are no instruments capable_0.206 to measure the magnitude or direction of A."
"fef-fragment03","678","In my opinion A is a useful thing if used with moderation ."
"fef-fragment03","679","It helped_-0.294 us to derive_0 Biot-Savart 's law_-0.032 , it will come_-0.353 handy_0.03 later in solving certain radiation problems , and it often leads_-0.094 to nice_-0.371 formulae_0.29 , e.g. for the magnetic flux_0.312 crossing a surface , defined as formula that may be rewritten in terms of the vector potential_-0.059 as follows_-0.343 : formula where C is the curve enclosing the surface ."
"fef-fragment03","680","We have now collected a good_-0.242 number of formulae_0.029 which will serve_-0.29 us well in the following_-0.324 sections_0.114 ."

"fef-fragment03","687","The defocusing of an electron beam_0.03 ( J , E , D , p , H , B )"
"fef-fragment03","688","We have so far_0.061 talked about positive_-0.083 and negative_0.062 charges_-0.147 , about point_-0.182 charges_0.083 , and distributed charge_0.059 ."

"fef-fragment03","690","This is not a necessity ."
"fef-fragment03","691","It is possible to study_-0.086 electromagnetic theory without ever mentioning the word electron , but since it has become such a household_0.069 word and is used so often we can just as well make_-0.188 use of it ."
"fef-fragment03","692","In the present_0.125 section_0 we shall consider_-0.312 a cylindrical electron beam_-0.125 of radius a in which the charge_0 density_0.088 is uniform ( p = Po ) and all electrons travel_0.143 with velocity v."
"fef-fragment03","693","We are not going_-0.4 to enquire into the details how such beams_0.121 can be produced ( it belongs to the subject_0.114 of physical electronics ) ; we shall accept the fact that the beam_0.065 exists and will try to work out the forces_0.143 on the outermost electrons ."
"fef-fragment03","694","There is now cylindrical symmetry and a net charge_-0.147 per unit length formula , yielding_0.441 for the radial component_0.424 of the electric field_0.088 formula ."
"fef-fragment03","695","The magnetic field_-0.029 may be obtained_0.182 from Ampère 's law_-0.094 ( eqn ( 3.21 ) ) as follows_-0.273 formula , where the line_-0.133 integral is taken_-0.182 over the circle of radius a ( Fig. 3.2 ) , I is the total current_0 of the beam_0.062 and formula is the azimuthal component_-0.061 of the magnetic field_0.029 in the cylindrical coordinate system specified_0.091 by formula] ."
"fef-fragment03","696","From eqn ( 3.26 ) we get_-0.471 formula] ."
"fef-fragment03","697","The electric force_-0.086 on an electron of charge_-0.029 e travelling_0.029 at the edge of the beam_0.406 ( R = a ) is it is in the radial direction pointing_0.147 outwards ."
"fef-fragment03","698","The magnetic force_0.062 is perpendicular both to the direction of motion ( +z axis ) and the direction of magnetic field_-0.059 ( formula] direction ) ."
"fef-fragment03","699","The vectorial product_0.061 v X B gives_-0.312 an inward force_0.167 in the radial direction ."

"fef-fragment03","701","Noting that formula] and anticipating the relationship formula] to be derived_0.2 in Section_0.067 5.7 , we get_-0.314 the following_-0.029 formula_0.194 for the force_0.133 formula] , where c is the velocity of light ."
"fef-fragment03","702","It may be seen_-0.094 from the above_-0.094 equation that the magnetic force_0.125 is negligible in comparison with the electric force_-0.176 unless the velocity of the electron approaches_-0.029 the velocity of light ."
"fef-fragment03","703","Thus the conclusion is that , owing to the repulsive forces_0.143 between the electrons , a cylindrical electron beam_0 is unstable_0.182 ."
"fef-fragment03","704","Using a technical_0.455 term_-0.114 borrowed_0.03 from electron optics we could say_-0.333 that the electron beam_-0.029 gets defocused ."
"fef-fragment03","705","The other conclusion ( as far_-0.333 as it is permissible to generalize from a single example ) is more important in principle ."
"fef-fragment03","706","It is concerned_0 with the relative magnitudes of electric and magnetic forces_-0.097 ."
"fef-fragment03","707","Since charged_0.229 particles rarely travel_-0.059 close_-0.306 to the velocity of light we may conclude that the magnetic forces_-0.118 are by orders of magnitude smaller_-0.059 than the electric forces_0.206 ."
"fef-fragment03","708","Why is it then_-0.5 that we have no difficulties in practice in observing magnetic fields_-0.118 ?"
"fef-fragment03","709","The reason is , of course , that there are two kinds of electric charges_0.03 and their effect usually cancels_0.059 , so the small magnetic field_0.118 has a chance of getting observed ."
"fef-fragment03","710","And that brings_-0.281 us to the ext example ."
"fef-fragment03","711","3.3 Pinch_0.25 effect ( J , H , B )"
"fef-fragment03","712","In contrast_0.059 to our previous example we shall now investigate_0.061 a cylindrical beam_0.088 consisting of two kinds of charge_-0.147 carriers_0.344 : negative_0.371 electrons and some positive_0.059 particles , which I do not wish to be more precise about at the moment ."
"fef-fragment03","713","We shall assume_0 that the two kinds of particles have equal densities_0.152 and move in opposite_-0.147 directions ."
"fef-fragment03","714","As a result there is no net space charge_-0.333 and hence no electric field_-0.029 ."
"fef-fragment03","715","The currents_-0.029 , on the other hand_-0.065 , do not cancel_0.028 because they represent opposite_-0.032 charges_-0.033 moving in opposite_-0.235 directions ( remember , minus one times minus one is equal to plus one ) ."
"fef-fragment03","716","The magnetic field_-0.029 strength_-0.03 is given_-0.118 again by eqn ( 3.27 ) ; we only need to substitute_0 for the current_0.188 In + Ip where the subscripts n and p refer_-0.029 to negative_-0.161 and positive_-0.152 particles respectively ."
"fef-fragment03","717","Hence the magnetic force_-0.031 on the electron at the edge of the beam_0.062 ( at R = a ) is formula] , and on the positive_0.059 particle is formula] ."
"fef-fragment03","718","Note that the force_0.147 is inwards , and in the same direction for both particles ."
"fef-fragment03","719","Let us distinguish two cases ."
"fef-fragment03","720","Both particles are mobile"
"fef-fragment03","721","In that case both of them will move inwards under the effect of magnetic force_-0.406 ."
"fef-fragment03","722","But if the diameter of the beam_0.333 is reduced , eqns ( 3.33 ) and ( 3.34 ) tell_-0.471 us that the forces_0.03 are even larger_-0.242 ."
"fef-fragment03","723","What happens then_-0.294 ?"
"fef-fragment03","724","If everything was uniform then_-0.235 the beam_0.182 diameter would go_-0.486 on decreasing ."
"fef-fragment03","725","In practice however the beam_0.121 is not uniform and does not possess_0.118 perfect cylindrical symmetry ."
"fef-fragment03","726","Under these conditions the motion of the particles is fairly complicated , and of course our model is unable to predict_0.061 the detailed behaviour_0 of the particles ."
"fef-fragment03","727","Nevertheless a few qualitative conclusions may be drawn_0.303 without_-0.152 doing any further_-0.059 mathematics ."
"fef-fragment03","728","If the cross-section happens to be smaller at a certain place , then_-0.147 the forces_-0.121 are larger_-0.29 there than at the neighbouring cross-sections , so the beam_0.029 will be further_0.03 constricted , etc. , leading_0.033 to the so-called_0.219 sausage_0.394 instability ( Fig. 3.3(a) ) ."
"fef-fragment03","729","If the magnetic field_0.031 happens to be larger at one side than at the other side , then_-0.419 the beam_0.029 will be deflected towards the weaker_0.03 field_0.029 which makes_-0.455 the field_0.091 even weaker_0 , etc. , leading_-0.375 to the so-called_0.323 kink_0.457 instability ( Fig. 3.3(b) ) ."
"fef-fragment03","730","The positive_-0.056 particle is immobile"
"fef-fragment03","731","In practice this means that the positive_0.029 ions are part of the crystal lattice_0.333 ."
"fef-fragment03","732","There is then_-0.281 no magnetic force_-0.086 on the ions , only on the electrons ."
"fef-fragment03","733","So the electrons want_-0.286 to move inwards but can not because the ions hold_-0.387 them back by virtue_0.152 of their electrostatic attraction ."
"fef-fragment03","734","Naturally , if the ions attract the electrons the converse is true as well , i.e. owing to the magnetic force_-0.121 on the electrons , there is also an inward force_0 upon the ions ."
"fef-fragment03","735","So the whole crystal structure tries_-0.057 to contract or in other words the material is under pressure ( see Example 3.2 ) ."
"fef-fragment03","736","In any practical situation this pressure is small_-0.353 and can be neglected when calculating the forces_-0.091 on current-carrying_0.076 conductors_0.176 ."
"fef-fragment03","737","3.4 ."
"fef-fragment03","738","Flow_0.091 patterns_0.061 and Ohm 's law_0.057 ( J , E , D )"
"fef-fragment03","739","Up to now we have not enquired into the question of how the current_0.062 arose_0.1 ."
"fef-fragment03","740","We just assumed_-0.129 that certain charge_0.029 carriers_0.265 moved with certain velocities ."
"fef-fragment03","741","Now we shall say_-0.265 that in a class of materials the current_-0.121 density_0.343 at any point is proportional to the electric field_-0.121 ; in mathematical form_-0.182 formula] , where formula] is the conductivity of the material ."
"fef-fragment03","742","The above_-0.29 equation is spite of its utmost simplicity represents an extremely good_-0.438 guess ."
"fef-fragment03","743","It is valid for nearly all materials up to quite high_-0.281 electric fields_0.344 ."
"fef-fragment03","744","Will there be a magnetic field_-0.029 ?"
"fef-fragment03","745","Yes , of course , whenever there is a current_-0.067 there is a magnetic field_-0.303 as well ."
"fef-fragment03","746","But the effect of the magnetic field_-0.029 upon the motion of the electrons is nearly always negligible ( one exception causing the pinch_0.176 effect is mentioned in the previous section_-0.206 ) ."
"fef-fragment03","747","Thus we may safely_0.086 ignore the magnetic field_-0.061 when determining_0.235 the lines_-0.057 of current_-0.235 flow_0.094 ."
"fef-fragment03","748","We are then_-0.206 left_-0.182 with only one equation formula] or formula] or formula] , depending on our preference ."
"fef-fragment03","749","Eqn ( 3.38 ) tells_-0.176 us that there is some analogy ( see Example 3.3 ) with the electrostatic case treated in Chapter 2 ."
"fef-fragment03","750","We may , in fact , reinterpret any of the diagrams of Figs ( 2.25 ) -(2.31) by assuming_0.212 that the whole space is filled with a material of conductivity formula] and the field_0.094 lines_-0.028 are now the lines_-0.029 of current_0.086 flow_0.061 as well ."
"fef-fragment03","751","Is the analogy perfect ?"
"fef-fragment03","752","Not really , because ( 1 ) as current_-0.03 flows_0.235 there is some potential_0.323 drop_-0.031 in the electrode itself , ( 2 ) zero conductivity for part_-0.176 of the space can not be electrostatically modelled since there are no dielectrics with Er = 0 , and ( 3 ) when current_-0.226 flows_0.235 through two materials of different conductivity there is generally a surface charge_0.147 at the boundary ( see Example 3.4 ) ."
"fef-fragment03","753","It is not worth discussing any of these complications because one is rarely called_-0.171 upon to work out lines_-0.059 of current_-0.088 in a conductor_0.121 ."
"fef-fragment03","754","We shall rather return_-0.057 to a very simple_-0.382 geometrical configuration for deriving_0.472 Ohm 's law_-0.29 ."
"fef-fragment03","755","We shall take a piece of cylindrical material of length l and cross-section S and apply_-0.188 a voltage between the ends ."
"fef-fragment03","756","The electric field_-0.062 is then_-0.235 formula] , the current_-0.344 density_0.429 formula] , and the current_-0.094 formula] ."

"fef-fragment03","759","Since formula] is by definition the resistivity we get_-0.559 the result you learned in school that the electrical resistance_0.265 is proportional to the resistivity and the length of the sample and inversely proportional to its cross-section ."
"fef-fragment03","760","A more general definition of resistance_0.086 valid for varying cross-sections may be easily arrived_-0.147 at , but it is hardly worth the trouble_-0.088 ."
"fef-fragment03","761","The essential thing is that the relation formula] is equivalent to Ohm 's law_0.03 ."
"fef-fragment03","762","Risking_0.382 the dismay of circuit_0.281 engineers some theoreticians do , in fact , refer_-0.094 to eqn ( 3.35 ) as Ohm 's law_0 ."

"fet-fragment01","4","She had said , peremptory as always , that he was to go straight_-0.088 to Room III , where "" the miraculous stuff "" was to be found ."
"fet-fragment01","5","Early ."
"fet-fragment01","6","So here he was , a distinguished public man , also an artist of a kind , stepping obediently through Room I ( French 1880s ) and Room II ( British 1880s and 1890s ) , on a lead_-0.088 grey_0.118 morning , to the pale_-0.121 grey , classical , quiet_0.03 place where the bright light shone and sang_0.094 off pigment so that the phrase , miraculous stuff , seemed merely accurate_0.118 ."
"fet-fragment01","7","On one long wall hung a row of Van Goghs , including an Arles "" Poets ' Garden "" he had n't seen before_-0.188 , but recognised , from small photographs , from charged descriptions in the painter 's letters ."
"fet-fragment01","8","He sat down and saw a bifurcated path , simmering_0.6 with gold_0.182 heat round and under the rising , spreading_0.161 blue-black-green down-pointing_0.125 vanes_0.457 of a great pine , still widening where the frame interrupted its soaring_0.118 ."
"fet-fragment01","9","Two decorous figures advanced , hand-in-hand , under its suspended thickness ."
"fet-fragment01","10","And beyond , green grass and geraniums like splashes_0.303 of blood_0.067 ."
"fet-fragment01","11","Alexander was not worried about whether Frederica would turn up ."
"fet-fragment01","12","She was no longer in the habit_-0.097 of being late : her life had schooled_0.333 her to temporal accuracy , perhaps to being considerate ."
"fet-fragment01","13","He himself , at sixty-two , felt_-0.056 , not quite accurately_0.182 , that he was now too old , too settled , to be put_-0.424 out , by her or by anyone else ."
"fet-fragment01","14","He thought with warmth_0.324 of her certain approach_0.212 ."
"fet-fragment01","15","There had been a pattern_0.152 , an only too discernible repetition in the events and relationships of his life into which she had ruggedly_0.281 refused to fit_-0.188 ."
"fet-fragment01","16","She had been a nuisance , a threat , a torment and was now a friend ."
"fet-fragment01","17","She had suggested that they look at Van Gogh together , setting_-0.029 up another form_-0.2 of repetition , deliberate , contrived and aesthetic ."
"fet-fragment01","18","His play , The Yellow Chair , had first been presented_0.029 in 1957 ; he did not like to think too closely_-0.032 about it , as he did not like to think too closely_-0.235 about any of his past work ."
"fet-fragment01","19","He stared at the serenely impassioned garden made out of a whirl of yellow brushstrokes , a viridian impasto , a dense mass of furiously_0.412 feathered_0.412 lines_-0.029 of blue-green , isolated black pot hooks , the painfully_0.286 clear_-0.091 orange-red spattering ."
"fet-fragment01","20","He had trouble finding_-0.219 an appropriate language for the painter 's obsession with the illuminated_0.697 material world_0.029 ."
"fet-fragment01","21","He would have been lying if he had recorded only the more accessible_0.371 drama_0.258 of the painter 's electric_0.333 quarrels with Gauguin in the Yellow House in Arles , the distant necessary brother who supplied paint and love , the severed ear delivered to the whore in the brothel , the asylum fears ."
"fet-fragment01","22","At first he had thought that he could write a plain_-0.029 , exact verse with no figurative language , in which a yellow chair was the thing itself , a yellow chair , as a round gold_0.029 apple was an apple or a sunflower a sunflower ."
"fet-fragment01","23","Sometimes he still saw_-0.543 the brushstrokes , as it were , in this naked_0.344 way_-0.206 , so that his earlier thoughts of this garden had to be undone_0.065 , the idea of black wings to be stripped_0.438 from the painted leafage , the vulgar idea of blood splashes washed_0.258 off the notation of geraniums ."
"fet-fragment01","24","But it could n't be done ."
"fet-fragment01","25","Language was against him , for a start_-0.057 ."
"fet-fragment01","26","Metaphor lay_-0.094 coiled_0.242 in the name sunflower , which not only turned towards but resembled the sun , the source_-0.031 of light ."
"fet-fragment01","27","Van Gogh 's idea of things_-0.206 had also been against him ."
"fet-fragment01","28","The yellow chair , besides being brushstrokes and pigment , besides being a yellow chair , was one of twelve bought for a company of artists who were to inhabit the Yellow House , the white walls of which should blaze_0.529 with sunflowers as the windows of Gothic cathedrals blazed_0.371 with coloured light ."
"fet-fragment01","29","Not only metaphor : cultural motif_0.429 , immanent religion , a faith and a church ."
"fet-fragment01","30","One thing_-0.412 always linked_-0.03 to another thing_-0.333 ."
"fet-fragment01","31","As the Poets ' Garden , a decoration for the bedroom of the "" poet Gauguin "" was more than it seemed ."

"fet-fragment01","37","But is n't it true_-0.147 , this garden has a fantastic_0.182 character_0.2 which makes_-0.057 you quite able to imagine the poets of the Renaissance strolling among these bushes and over the flowery grass ? …"

"fpb-fragment01","1059","WEDNESDAY , 12 JANUARY 1966"
"fpb-fragment01","1060","Clare still swapped_0.433 one night a week off with Stephanie and reported subsequent events to Gilda , who now managed the shoe shop : occasionally she visited Clare for an evening meal ."
"fpb-fragment01","1061","As Clare poured sherry , Gilda asked , ‘ So how was the BOAC pilot ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1062","‘ Tony was the worst yet . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1063","Clare never felt_-0.364 embarrassed discussing sex with Gilda , who could talk about little else ."
"fpb-fragment01","1064","‘ He 'd read all the sex manuals ever printed ."
"fpb-fragment01","1065","Whipped_-0.031 a porn magazine out of his flight case after the first gin and tonic ."
"fpb-fragment01","1066","He was coldly_0.156 determined to be a good lover ."
"fpb-fragment01","1067","For me , that was a total turn-off_0.265 . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1068","‘ Porn pictures are a turn-off_0.156 to most women ."
"fpb-fragment01","1069","Women like words , not pictures , ’ Gilda said as she sipped her drink ."
"fpb-fragment01","1070","‘ But I 'm starting to think that everything 's a turn-off_0.314 for you , doll_0.333 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1071","You clearly ca n't have sex with fellas you ai n't fond of ."
"fpb-fragment01","1072","I expect you need a chap you know well , someone you feel_-0.156 comfortable_0.029 with , not these one-nighters . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1073","She swallowed half the glass ."
"fpb-fragment01","1074","‘ Now me , I 'm the reverse_0.353 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1075","If I do n't give_-0.412 a damn about ‘ em , I ai n't anxious , and if I ai n't anxious , then I come_-0.242 easy . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1076","She drained her glass ."
"fpb-fragment01","1077","‘ When Tony could n't get_-0.438 me to climax_0.529 , he wanted to ask another girl over , ’ Clare said ."
"fpb-fragment01","1078","‘ He automatically_-0.344 assumed_-0.094 that I was a lesbian . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1079","‘ That 's not what he meant , ’ Gilda said ."
"fpb-fragment01","1080","‘ Lots of guys find_-0.257 it a turn-on to watch two women making_-0.176 love . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1081","‘ How very odd_0.156 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1082","Can you imagine a woman trying to get two men into bed so she could watch them ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1083","‘ Forget this guy , ’ said Gilda ."
"fpb-fragment01","1084","‘ I know what you need , Clare : someone you know and trust , someone who wo n't make_-0.333 you feel_-0.059 anxious ."
"fpb-fragment01","1085","Then you 'll relax and it 'll happen — then you 'll stop being one of them miserable nymphos who hop_0.286 from man to man , hoping for Mr Right , the man who can satisfy her . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1086","As Gilda held out her glass to be refilled , she added_-0.176 reflectively_0.353 , ‘ Although you seem more lonely than horny_0.152 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1087","Are you looking_-0.412 for sex , or just someone to talk to ?"

"fpb-fragment01","1091","I just want a short-term relationship , without responsibility . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1092","Gilda laughed ."
"fpb-fragment01","1093","‘ So do these fellas you pick_0.062 up ."
"fpb-fragment01","1094","But I 'm not convinced that 's right for you ."
"fpb-fragment01","1095","You need a secure_0.294 situation_0.029 with someone you can trust , who you know will stick around because he loves you ."
"fpb-fragment01","1096","I 'll tell you who you ought to fall_-0.265 in love with , Clare . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1097","‘ Who ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1098","‘ Yourself ."
"fpb-fragment01","1099","You clearly think that you 're a piece_-0.121 of worthless_0.25 rubbish_-0.188 , and if I pick_-0.306 up those vibes , then so do the blokes ."
"fpb-fragment01","1100","Why not give_-0.314 sex a rest_-0.029 for a bit , and pay_-0.118 a bit_-0.059 of attention to yourself ?"
"fpb-fragment01","1101","You never want to make_-0.455 a man the centre_0 of your existence ."
"fpb-fragment01","1102","That place_-0.059 is for you , Clare . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1103","‘ I am the centre_0.156 of my existence , ’ Clare sang , as if chanting_0.471 a psalm_0.303 , pitching_0.182 her voice an octave lower_-0.212 , as she pushed Josh to her playgroup the next morning ."
"fpb-fragment01","1104","A man stood on the porch , his hands in the pocket of his beige mackintosh ."
"fpb-fragment01","1105","‘ Good morning ."
"fpb-fragment01","1106","Are you a prospective parent ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1107","Clare asked ."
"fpb-fragment01","1108","She felt in her pocket for the key ."
"fpb-fragment01","1109","‘ No. ’ said the man ."
"fpb-fragment01","1110","I 'm an inspector for the local education authority . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1111","After examining the bathroom , the inspector pointed_0.088 out that legally one toilet was required for every seven kiddies ."
"fpb-fragment01","1112","Clare said , ‘ But if each child goes there every two and a half hours , one lavatory is adequate ."
"fpb-fragment01","1113","There is a potty for emergencies ."
"fpb-fragment01","1114","We have never had a problem . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1115","The inspector was not listening ."
"fpb-fragment01","1116","He was making notes on other violations ."
"fpb-fragment01","1117","Half an hour after the inspector left , as if to prove his point_-0.121 , the lavatory refused_0.242 to flush ."
"fpb-fragment01","1118","The following_-0.088 morning , Clare 's playgroup was ordered to close_-0.212 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1119","Two days later , Clare 's mind was unexpectedly diverted_0.353 from her personal problems — no job , no man — when the CND office telephoned_0.419 to ask her for voluntary evening help : they were organizing another protest after a nuclear accident ."
"fpb-fragment01","1120","Over Spain , an American B-52 bomber carrying_-0.029 an H-bomb had collided in mid-air with another aircraft ."
"fpb-fragment01","1121","The H-bomb , with an explosive capacity of more than a million tons of TNT , had fallen into the Atlantic Ocean off southern Spain ."
"fpb-fragment01","1122","Clare felt_-0.235 cheered_0.353 to be back among like-minded people , doing something worth while ."
"fpb-fragment01","1123","MONDAY , 14 FEBRUARY 1966"
"fpb-fragment01","1124","Valentine 's Day brought_-0.118 two happy_-0.286 events ."
"fpb-fragment01","1125","The radio reported_0.031 that the missing H-bomb had been located on the Atlantic seabed ."
"fpb-fragment01","1126","And to Clare 's delight , she sold the lease of the apartment in which she ran_-0.188 her playgroup — for a profit of twenty-three per cent ."
"fpb-fragment01","1127","Clare felt_-0.294 as if she had won a sweepstake ."
"fpb-fragment01","1128","On the following_0 morning , she bought a portable TV , a warm winter coat for herself , and new clothes for Josh ."
"fpb-fragment01","1129","She did n't buy any toys for Josh because she had decided to open_-0.364 a toy shop ."
"fpb-fragment01","1130","Two weeks later , Clare bought the short_0.281 lease of a small shop in the Pimlico Road , close to Mrs Gooden 's home ."
"fpb-fragment01","1131","Though there was a lot_-0.212 to do , Clare , busy redecorating the shop and visiting wholesalers to buy stock , still managed_-0.257 to work one evening a week for the Movement ."
"fpb-fragment01","1132","In mid-April , just before her toy shop opened_0.258 , Clare 's weary , amiable , National Health doctor looked up from his desk and said , ‘ About your vaginal symptoms , Mrs Shapiro ."
"fpb-fragment01","1133","You 'd better go to St Stephen 's for tests : they 're properly equipped to handle_-0.03 this sort of thing_-0.273 . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1134","He seemed uneasy ."
"fpb-fragment01","1135","‘ What sort of thing_-0.229 ? …"
"fpb-fragment01","1136","Not … cancer ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1137","‘ No , gonorrhoea , ’ the doctor said apologetically ."
"fpb-fragment01","1138","Clare almost fainted from surprise and anxiety , horror and shame ."
"fpb-fragment01","1139","Then she wept ."
"fpb-fragment01","1140","The doctor refused to give her more sleeping tablets but scribbled a prescription for tranquillizers , which were increasingly prescribed for women like Clare , with symptoms of anxiety in stressful situations_-0.03 such as poverty , divorce , or bereavement ; women with marital problems and women who were out of work also found_-0.294 them helpful_-0.344 , although the pills did nothing to resolve the problem responsible_0.147 for the initial anxiety ."
"fpb-fragment01","1141","Clare , who blushed with shame whenever she thought about it , waited anxiously for the result of her tests at St Stephen 's Hospital ."
"fpb-fragment01","1142","The tests were negative ."
"fpb-fragment01","1143","But within a month , she could n't get_-0.29 through the day without tranquillizers ; she felt_-0.355 less anxious , calmer ."
"fpb-fragment01","1144","Clare managed to open_-0.294 the Red Rocking Horse by mid-May ."
"fpb-fragment01","1145","At the opening party , an excited three-and-a-half-year-old Josh rode the pretty antique red rocking horse in the shop window ."
"fpb-fragment01","1146","MONDAY , 15 AUGUST 1966"
"fpb-fragment01","1147","Standing by the swimming pool at Saracen , Miranda beckoned to Adam , who was floating on the water in a transparent blow-up plastic armchair ."
"fpb-fragment01","1148","In a voice of soft_0.303 persuasion , she said , ‘ Will you do something for me , Adam ?"
"fpb-fragment01","1149","I 'm going to learn to fly ."
"fpb-fragment01","1150","I want you to break_-0.118 the news gently to Gran . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1151","‘ But you promised your grandmother not to learn to fly , ’ Adam objected ."
"fpb-fragment01","1152","‘ It was a condition of her gift to you the ten thousand pounds ’ capital to start KITS . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1153","I did n't say for ever ."
"fpb-fragment01","1154","I 'll pay the money back to her . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1155","Miranda was defiant ."
"fpb-fragment01","1156","‘ I 've always wanted to fly ."
"fpb-fragment01","1157","I wo n't be held_-0.114 by a promise that was unfairly extracted_0.176 from me before I legally became an adult ."
"fpb-fragment01","1158","And I get bored with nothing to do on holiday but lie in the sun . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1159","‘ When are you starting ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1160","Adam asked , resigned ."
"fpb-fragment01","1161","‘ This morning , at the Cannes flying school ."
"fpb-fragment01","1162","They have English instructors ."
"fpb-fragment01","1163","Four hours of instruction a day for two weeks ."
"fpb-fragment01","1164","And of course , this time of year , it 's perfect flying weather ! ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1165","Miranda was triumphant now ."
"fpb-fragment01","1166","‘ I 've already passed_-0.312 the two written exams ."
"fpb-fragment01","1167","Did law and meteorology last Easter , and now I 've finished navigation , radiotelephony , and technical — that was the toughest_0.429 . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1168","So that 's why you 're so pale . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1169","Three hours later , two thousand feet above the Mediterranean , Miranda , alert and exultant , sat next to her instructor at the controls of a trainer plane , an ugly little single-engine Rallye which her instructor described as efficient and forgiving_0.206 : you could do something wrong m a Rallye without getting immediately punished_-0.029 for it ."
"fpb-fragment01","1170","Flying was even better than she had hoped : better than skiing , better than driving a sports car ."
"fpb-fragment01","1171","As the Rallye droned towards the lighthouse on the tip of Cap Camerat , Miranda felt_-0.061 as if she were breathing_0.031 the air_-0.147 of the gods_0.441 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1172","Gently they swooped , turned , and climbed_0.091 in the azure sky ."
"fpb-fragment01","1173","After they reached_-0.03 two thousand feet , the instructor showed her how to fly level ; he then encouraged her to experiment with the stick_0.029 , manoeuvring the plane m every direction ."
"fpb-fragment01","1174","Miranda felt_-0.353 that the aircraft was an extension_0.028 of her arms and her fingertips , outspread in flight ."
"fpb-fragment01","1175","Heading west on the return flight path , the instructor said , ‘ This is the first time I 've flown with a pupil and have n't once needed to touch the controls . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1176","Miranda pushed_0 home_-0.242 this advantage ."
"fpb-fragment01","1177","‘ Then can I land ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1178","The instructor hesitated , then said , ‘ Why not ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1179","The girl was clearly a natural flyer ."
"fpb-fragment01","1180","After being given_-0.206 clearance_0.029 to land , Miranda , following_0.091 her instructor 's directions_0.091 , started her approach ; she throttled back to reduce_0.212 speed and control_0.029 her descent as she flew towards the threshold_0.147 — the point_-0.235 just before she intended to touch down ."
"fpb-fragment01","1181","The plane was now moving_-0.125 at not much above stalling speed ."
"fpb-fragment01","1182","As the Rallye dropped to about_-0.314 thirty feet above the runway , Miranda throttled back completely and held the stick_0.176 back ."
"fpb-fragment01","1183","The plane seemed to glide forward and land itself ."
"fpb-fragment01","1184","The undemonstrative Miranda flung_0.065 her arms around the instructor ."
"fpb-fragment01","1185","‘ Oh , thank you !"
"fpb-fragment01","1186","Thank you !"
"fpb-fragment01","1187","‘ Quite a smooth_0.212 landing , ’ the instructor said approvingly He hesitated , then warned , ‘ Next time be careful not to land too fast or you 'll run_-0.25 out of runway . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1188","This woman was adventurous and ambitious : such pilots did not live long ."
"fpb-fragment01","1189","He added_-0.152 , ‘ Careful pilots are the ones that survive ."
"fpb-fragment01","1190","A good pilot never takes_-0.375 a risk . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1191","‘ The opposite of a good businessman , ’ Miranda said , still on a high_-0.286 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1192","‘ A businessman has to take_-0.429 risks constantly — and win sixty per cent of the time . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1193","‘ In the air , that risk factor would kill_-0.114 you . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1194","Nine hundred years earlier , the great hall had been the hub_0.156 of castle life : wolfhounds ate on floors strewn with rushes ; servants slept on straw pallets thrown on the floor ."
"fpb-fragment01","1195","Then , the winter salon did not smell of lilies and expensive leather but of stale_0.125 , fat , stinking human bodies and animal ordure ."
"fpb-fragment01","1196","Elinor sometimes thought of all the love and the hatred , the treachery and the killing that this hall had undoubtedly seen_-0.125 , when strong men fought hand-to-hand to the death , to protect their women and children ."
"fpb-fragment01","1197","Now the winter salon at Saracen , where Elinor waited for Adam , was not only the coolest but the most impressive room in the château ."
"fpb-fragment01","1198","High arched walls of pale_0.029 , honey-coloured stone were hung with bluish-green tapestries ; around the big stone fireplace , where logs burned in winter , stood_-0.061 sofas covered in the blues and greens of the tapestries ; here and there were lamps , flowers , books , and piles of parlour games ."
"fpb-fragment01","1199","‘ What 's keeping_-0.061 Adam ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1200","Elinor asked Buzz , who was adding up the Scrabble score_-0.294 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1201","‘ You said three o'clock ."
"fpb-fragment01","1202","It 's only two-thirty , ’ Buzz said ."
"fpb-fragment01","1203","‘ Ninety-three for you , two hundred and sixty-four for me ."
"fpb-fragment01","1204","That 's not a bad score_-0.061 for you , Nell . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1205","Buzz never cheated to let Elinor win : she knew that Elinor would immediately sense this and feel_-0.5 humiliated ."
"fpb-fragment01","1206","After an intensive rehabilitation programme of physiotherapy and speech therapy , Elinor appeared to have completely recovered from her stroke_-0.091 , although she could no longer think of three things_-0.212 at once , which Buzz said was a mercy for the people who had to live with her ."
"fpb-fragment01","1207","Elinor was sometimes at a loss_-0.033 for the right word , or name , and then became impatient with herself ; she was often frustrated because she could n't move as swiftly as she did before_-0.355 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1208","At times , she was downhearted and wondered whether she would ever write another book ."
"fpb-fragment01","1209","‘ When you want to write , you 'll write , ’ Buzz would tell her then ."
"fpb-fragment01","1210","Now Buzz grunted , ‘ Look what I tore out of the Daily Mail . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1211","She dug_-0.242 into her pocket , unfolded a bit of newspaper , and read , Sportsman Jim Clark today opened_-0.219 a splendidly equipped physical training college at Larkwood in Wiltshire , formerly the family home of the O'Dare family ."
"fpb-fragment01","1212","Lady O'Dare commented , ‘ I wish them well . ’ ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1213","‘ I doubt that . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1214","Elinor peered at the photograph of the new owner , a motor-racing hero , standing with her sister-in-law , Marjorie ."
"fpb-fragment01","1215","The doorbell sounded ."
"fpb-fragment01","1216","‘ I 'll go , ’ Buzz said ."
"fpb-fragment01","1217","‘ It 's either Adam or the postman . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1218","Buzz returned reading a postcard ."
"fpb-fragment01","1219","‘ It 's for you , from Sonia Rushleigh …"
"fpb-fragment01","1220","Whoops , I mean Bromley ."
"fpb-fragment01","1221","Who 'd have thought them two would marry ?"
"fpb-fragment01","1222","She says the Colonel 's taken up petit point , and Miss Hawkins is teaching him ."
"fpb-fragment01","1223","Remember her , the schoolmistress ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1224","‘ I do indeed , ’ said Elinor ."
"fpb-fragment01","1225","‘ Frumpy sourpuss !"
"fpb-fragment01","1226","Who 's the letter from ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1227","‘ Clare . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1228","Buzz held the envelope out to Elinor ."
"fpb-fragment01","1229","Elinor shook her head ."
"fpb-fragment01","1230","‘ You open it . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1231","‘ It 's marked personal . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1232","‘ I do n't want to read it , unless she apologizes . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1233","Buzz opened the letter and read it ."
"fpb-fragment01","1234","She shook her head ."
"fpb-fragment01","1235","‘ It 's just a friendly_-0.273 letter , asking_-0.485 how you are ."
"fpb-fragment01","1236","But reading between the lines_-0.057 , I think Clare needs money . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1237","‘ If she took her poor_0 child back to his father and gave_-0.485 her husband a second chance , she would n't need money . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1238","‘ How about a bit_-0.029 of generosity ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1239","Buzz said ."
"fpb-fragment01","1240","‘ You 're a silly , stubborn old woman ."
"fpb-fragment01","1241","And Clare 's just as stubborn and just as silly ."
"fpb-fragment01","1242","It would n't have hurt_-0.086 her to say she was sorry . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1243","Elinor looked anxious ."
"fpb-fragment01","1244","‘ Do you really think she 's short_0 of money , Buzz ?"
"fpb-fragment01","1245","I would n't want her to have a rough_-0.062 time . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1246","This remark was overheard by Adam as , in pale_0.188 blue shirt and jeans , he sauntered through the door ."
"fpb-fragment01","1247","He said , ‘ Elinor , you allowed ample provision in the trust for helping Clare — if the trustees consider_-0.091 that help is needed ."
"fpb-fragment01","1248","I 'll check on Clare when I get back to London . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1249","He put a pile of papers on a side table ."
"fpb-fragment01","1250","‘ There 's rather a lot_-0.125 of paperwork here , things_-0.235 that you should be aware of . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1251","‘ We 've had more paperwork , not less , since the trust took over , ’ Buzz said tartly_0.441 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1252","‘ And I tell you frankly that I ca n't follow_-0.394 it , Adam ."
"fpb-fragment01","1253","I thought the trustees were going to manage the business ."
"fpb-fragment01","1254","Elinor should n't be made_0.031 to wade_0.576 though pages of paragraphs with no commas in ‘ em . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1255","‘ Of course the trustees manage the business , and they do it very well , ’ Adam said ."
"fpb-fragment01","1256","‘ And there 's no reason for Elinor to see any of this if it tires her ."
"fpb-fragment01","1257","In fact , I 'm about to suggest something that would simplify matters . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1258","‘ What 's that ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1259","Buzz asked ."
"fpb-fragment01","1260","‘ I 'd like to substitute Paul Littlejohn for myself in the power_-0.086 of attorney that I hold_-0.088 on your behalf , Elinor ."
"fpb-fragment01","1261","I 'm trying to reduce_-0.061 the number of business administrators : the fewer there are , the simpler the system_-0.176 and the cheaper it will be . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1262","‘ Does that mean_-0.242 that Paul will be legally responsible for Elinor 's affairs instead of you , Adam ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1263","‘ Yes , but that 's only a technicality ."
"fpb-fragment01","1264","Paul will do as I say ."
"fpb-fragment01","1265","And I 'd also like you to sign this document , Adam added_-0.029 , ‘ which absolves_0.394 me and STG from any further responsibility once Paul Littlejohn has been substituted . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1266","Buzz said , ‘ But surely … ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1267","Smoothly_0.03 Adam explained , ‘ The responsibility must clearly rest_-0.029 m only one area_-0.194 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1268","It 's in your interests to clarify_-0.062 the situation_0.094 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1269","It 's customary . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1270","‘ If you think that 's best , Adam dear . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1271","Elinor frowned slightly at Buzz ."
"fpb-fragment01","1272","Adam decided to hold_0.226 back Miranda 's bombshell until later , after Elinor drank her evening glass of champagne ."
"fpb-fragment01","1273","Just before five o'clock , when the business session had ended and the afternoon was still hot , quiet_-0.152 , and heavy_0.094 with languor , Buzz left to get some tea ."
"fpb-fragment01","1274","Adam escorted Elinor to the elevator ; after taking her to her bedroom , he intended to go to the beach for a swim ."
"fpb-fragment01","1275","In the high-ceilinged kitchen , surrounded by the smells of mint and basil , Buzz whistled ‘ Roses of Picardy ’ with much dramatic_0.118 warbling_0.371 as she prepared Elinor 's tea ."
"fpb-fragment01","1276","Leaves and yellow blossoms obscured the top of the window , while the bottom was covered by aggressive_0.452 pink hollyhocks , seemingly determined_0.091 to fight_0.029 their way_-0.412 inside ."
"fpb-fragment01","1277","Sylvie , the cook , sat at the big kitchen table by the window , writing a list and shooing pigeons away ."
"fpb-fragment01","1278","The bane of Sylvie 's life was the pigeon droppings that littered the windowsill and had to be cleaned up daily ."
"fpb-fragment01","1279","With a shudder , Sylvie refused a cup of tea ."
"fpb-fragment01","1280","Still whistling , Buzz laid the tray ."
"fpb-fragment01","1281","The soporific calm_0.143 of the drowsy_0.25 afternoon was shattered_0.364 by the bell indicator above the kitchen door ."
"fpb-fragment01","1282","Someone was jabbing the bell — non-stop — in Elinor 's bedroom ."
"fpb-fragment01","1283","Knowing that Adam was probably in the elevator on his way to the beach , Buzz hurled herself out of the kitchen and ran upstairs ."
"fpb-fragment01","1284","Frantically she tore_-0.059 open the door to Elinor 's apartment ."
"fpb-fragment01","1285","In the passage , she stumbled and almost fell , then flung back the door to the bedroom ."
"fpb-fragment01","1286","To her relief_-0.485 , Elinor was not slumped on the floor ; deathly white , she clung for support to the silver brocade hangings of her bed ."
"fpb-fragment01","1287","Wordlessly , she pointed above the fireplace ."
"fpb-fragment01","1288","Buzz turned her head to the left , where the portrait of the three sisters hung ."
"fpb-fragment01","1289","At first Buzz saw nothing , but then she gasped in horror ."
"fpb-fragment01","1290","Each of the three long , creamy_0.031 necks had been cut horizontally : a small triangle of canvas hung downward from each slashed throat ."
"fpb-fragment01","1291","18"
"fpb-fragment01","1292","WEDNESDAY , 17 AUGUST 1966"
"fpb-fragment01","1293","In the foyer of the Clanrickard Club , Mike Grant leaned against the wall at the bottom of a double-sided curving staircase ."
"fpb-fragment01","1294","With his hands in the pockets of his dinner jacket , he surveyed_0.171 the room ."
"fpb-fragment01","1295","It was going to be a good night , in spite of the fact that it was August and a Wednesday ."
"fpb-fragment01","1296","Making_-0.324 sure to appear casual , he carefully watched the men in dinner jackets and the women in full-length décolleté dresses move slowly over the red carpet towards the restaurant at the rear , or climb the staircase to the gaming rooms ."
"fpb-fragment01","1297","Mike noticed a group of heavy_0.147 gamblers , most of them Greek , move towards the baccarat room , where the Sultan of Rupolei had been losing for the last hour ."
"fpb-fragment01","1298","His attention was also caught_-0.235 by a woman dressed in midnight-blue satin and diamonds ; the sister of a Middle-Eastern ruler_0.118 , she was known as an audacious gambler ."
"fpb-fragment01","1299","He stiffened as he recognized a man move upstairs with a distinctive , boneless_0.333 saunter : he had better send someone up to check the backgammon room ."
"fpb-fragment01","1300","The club owners , the casinos , and the multinational bookmakers knew_-0.424 which professional gamblers successfully played games that contained_-0.088 an element_0.382 of skill — such as backgammon and poker- and they preferred to have nothing to do with them ; ideally , the house welcomed_-0.029 inexperienced , rich idiots ."
"fpb-fragment01","1301","‘ This is certainly a good night to play the odds . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1302","Mike heard a sarcastic voice from behind him ."
"fpb-fragment01","1303","He turned and smiled at Adam ."
"fpb-fragment01","1304","‘ Come into my office for a drink ."
"fpb-fragment01","1305","What 's up ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1306","In Mike 's office , furnished with heavily varnished Victorian club furniture ."
"fpb-fragment01","1307","Adam shook his head curtly at the offer of a chair ."
"fpb-fragment01","1308","‘ I 'm not staying , ’ he said ."
"fpb-fragment01","1309","‘ I merely wanted to tell you that you 've scared the hell_0.062 out of everyone at Saracen — except me ."
"fpb-fragment01","1310","So kindly curb your theatrical_0.618 , James Bond streak_0.343 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1311","I knew immediately what your message meant_-0.188 : ‘ If you do n't pay up , one slash is all it takes_-0.059 . ’ ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1312","He glared_-0.121 at his brother ."
"fpb-fragment01","1313","‘ I thought you were fond of Elinor ."
"fpb-fragment01","1314","I seem to recall_-0.333 that Elinor helped you to buy your first good bike ."
"fpb-fragment01","1315","Why drag_0.114 her into my problems ?"
"fpb-fragment01","1316","You might have given_-0.257 her another stroke_0.242 . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1317","‘ I do n't know what the hell_-0.161 you 're talking about , and I ca n't comment until I do . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1318","Mike , his face alert_-0.031 and wary_0.294 , lit a cigarette ."
"fpb-fragment01","1319","Adam briefly described how the triple portrait had been slashed and added_-0.03 , ‘ D' you really expect me to believe that you had nothing to do with it ?"
"fpb-fragment01","1320","Someone told some cat burglar where to find that picture ! ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1321","Mike stared at his brother , then slowly said , ‘ Not me ."
"fpb-fragment01","1322","I agree , it 's clearly a warning to pay , but I swear I know nothing about it ."
"fpb-fragment01","1323","It could n't have been the brothers — they 'd be even less subtle … ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1324","He inhaled deeply ."
"fpb-fragment01","1325","‘ Who else do you owe money , Adam , you stupid bastard_0.182 ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1326","‘ No one who 'd do anything so bloody childish !"
"fpb-fragment01","1327","How do I stop this bloody_0.257 nonsense ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1328","‘ How many times must I tell you that if you let_-0.484 things_-0.111 go_-0.176 too far_-0.125 , nobody can stop what will undoubtedly happen ?"
"fpb-fragment01","1329","Adam , ’ Mike went_-0.419 on quietly , ‘ you 've always taken_-0.455 full_-0.088 advantage of anyone who 's fond of you ."
"fpb-fragment01","1330","You think you can push me around because you 've been doing that since we were in the nursery ."
"fpb-fragment01","1331","You also grew up watching Grandfather 's clients literally get_-0.353 away_-0.344 with murder . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1332","He sucked on his cigarette , furiously threw it into the fireplace , shoved his hands in his pockets , and glared_0.152 at Adam ."
"fpb-fragment01","1333","‘ Do you want to be found washed up on the seashore with a few vital bits missing ?"
"fpb-fragment01","1334","Are you so anxious to know what it feels like to have both eyeballs gouged out , one at a time ?"
"fpb-fragment01","1335","Do you want to be slowly battered to death , before dying in agony ? ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1336","‘ Of course not , you bastard_0.424 , ’ Adam said ."
"fpb-fragment01","1337","‘ I only want to know who slashed that picture if you did n't . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1338","‘ Whoever they are — and only you know that — these people are serious ."
"fpb-fragment01","1339","Punters often try to avoid_-0.094 paying ."
"fpb-fragment01","1340","Examples often have to be made_-0.091 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1341","You know that . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1342","Mike started to stride up and down the room ."
"fpb-fragment01","1343","‘ Take_-0.182 that fucking urbane look off your face and face_0.029 reality , Adam ."
"fpb-fragment01","1344","If you lose_-0.206 money , that 's tough_0.125 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1345","But if you do n't pay up , that 's insanity . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1346","‘ I 've had enough of your melodrama_0.324 , ’ Adam snarled_0.333 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1347","Mike glared_0.312 at his brother again ."
"fpb-fragment01","1348","‘ I 'm not exaggerating ."
"fpb-fragment01","1349","Remember that incident when the Sultan 's sister had her Rolls stopped , at two in the morning on the Grande Corniche , after leaving the casino ?"
"fpb-fragment01","1350","They blew_-0.156 away the chauffeur 's head with a machine gun ."
"fpb-fragment01","1351","She was n't touched ."
"fpb-fragment01","1352","She paid all her gambling debts the very next day ."
"fpb-fragment01","1353","And when the story was carefully leaked_0.212 to the newspapers , quite a lot_-0.314 of other debts were suddenly settled_0.265 in full . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1354","‘ I 'm not some goddamned sultan 's sister . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1355","‘ No , but you also like playing_-0.303 with fire_-0.147 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1356","You never believe that the gods will really let it burn_-0.061 you ."
"fpb-fragment01","1357","You think you 're omnipotent — but you are n't . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1358","‘ Keep_-0.343 your voice down , ’ Adam growled_0.273 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1359","‘ I 'll do what I bloody well like in my own office , ’ Mike said ."
"fpb-fragment01","1360","‘ Do n't you understand ?"
"fpb-fragment01","1361","I 'm on your side_-0.303 , Adam ."
"fpb-fragment01","1362","You 're the only brother I have . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1363","His voice deepened_0.485 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1364","‘ I 'm probably more worried about this than you are ."
"fpb-fragment01","1365","If anything happened to you …"
"fpb-fragment01","1366","I 'd be left_-0.212 without you ."
"fpb-fragment01","1367","So for God 's sake , pay up , you stupid shit_0.152 !"
"fpb-fragment01","1368","Do n't think you can get_-0.606 away_-0.562 with it just because you 've always got_-0.444 away_-0.059 with everything , since you set_-0.152 that nursemaid 's apron alight . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1369","‘ I thought you were too young to remember that , ’ Adam said uneasily ."
"fpb-fragment01","1370","He added_-0.455 , ‘ She should n't have left the matches within reach of a child . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1371","‘ She was in hospital for six weeks , and I was the only one who knew it was n't an accident ."
"fpb-fragment01","1372","I knew you wanted to see_-0.75 how far_-0.343 you could go_-0.571 . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1373","‘ Let's not argue about something that happened over_-0.559 thirty years ago , ’ Adam said finally ."
"fpb-fragment01","1374","‘ Can you raise_-0.156 money to help me fend them off ?"
"fpb-fragment01","1375","I promise you ."
"fpb-fragment01","1376","within six months I know I 'll have no more money problems ."
"fpb-fragment01","1377","Never again . ’"
"fpb-fragment01","1378","‘ You 'll have money problems as long as you gamble , Adam ."
"fpb-fragment01","1379","Annabel was determined to get_-0.606 a grip_-0.364 on herself and do as Scott advised : remember 1965 as the year she stopped having to go to auditions and 1966 as the year in which she blossomed_0.294 into a successful young New York hostess as she met Andy Warhol , Lenny Bernstein , Baby Jane Holzer , and all the other gossip-columnist fodder_0.441 ."
"fpb-fragment01","1380","By July , Annabel was a Junior Friend of the Metropolitan Museum , a Friend of the Museum of Modern Art , and a patron of the Bronx Zoo ."
"fpb-fragment01","1381","She also allayed her insecurity with a massive_0.2 spending spree ; each charity dinner required a new ballgown , and each new glittering_0.379 friend — contacts_-0.059 for Scott — required a glittering_0.355 party ."
"fpb-fragment01","1382","So the year thus far_-0.324 was a busy one ."
"g0l-fragment01","1","The Long_-0.333 Road_-0.032 Home_-0.2"
"g0l-fragment01","2","CIA HQ_0.353 Langley"
"g0l-fragment01","3","Sorge had never been to Langley before ."
"g0l-fragment01","4","It was not something a Russian expected to do ."
"g0l-fragment01","5","It was after 9 a.m. when Nowak drove him through the gates , past the guards , and into the vast underground car-park ."
"g0l-fragment01","6","‘ Why Langley ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","7","Sorge had asked him on the way out of Washington ."
"g0l-fragment01","8","‘ They want to show_-0.273 you that they trust you . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","9","‘ I do n't expect I 'll see much . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","10","Nowak laughed ."
"g0l-fragment01","11","‘ Damn right ."
"g0l-fragment01","12","We park in the underground car-park , catch_-0.182 a special lift to the fifth floor and walk across the corridor into a special conference room . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","13","‘ That 's trust ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","14","‘ That 's trust . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","15","The Executive Director was already in the meeting room ."
"g0l-fragment01","16","‘ Welcome to Langley . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","17","He held his hand out in welcome ."
"g0l-fragment01","18","When the introductions were complete , the Exec Director , the DDA , the DDI , Sorge and Nowak settled themselves round the small conference table ."
"g0l-fragment01","19","‘ We have a new_-0.387 problem , ’ kicked_-0.059 off the Exec Director ."
"g0l-fragment01","20","‘ The English operative who was guarding Trimmler has taken off ."
"g0l-fragment01","21","He 's also taken an agent of ours with him ."
"g0l-fragment01","22","As hostage ."
"g0l-fragment01","23","A woman ."
"g0l-fragment01","24","We believe they 're still in New Orleans . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","25","‘ Why ? ’ asked Sorge , concerned ."
"g0l-fragment01","26","‘ I do n't know yet ."
"g0l-fragment01","27","What about Goodenache ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","28","He decided to turn_-0.147 the pressure_0.176 on the Russian ."
"g0l-fragment01","29","‘ He caught_-0.057 a flight to Frankfurt ."
"g0l-fragment01","30","he hired a car , but the car was found abandoned on the outskirts of Frankfurt ."
"g0l-fragment01","31","We are trying to find our missing scientist now . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","32","‘ Are the German authorities involved_0.029 ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","33","‘ No ."
"g0l-fragment01","34","We have our own means_0.062 . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","35","Sorge saw the Exec Director look up , his eyebrows raised_0.094 suddenly ."
"g0l-fragment01","36","‘ We both have our methods ."
"g0l-fragment01","37","Even in an independent Germany ."
"g0l-fragment01","38","After all , it was the death of our people in these situations_0.088 that has brought_-0.182 us together . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","39","The Exec Director shrugged ."
"g0l-fragment01","40","Bastard_0.576 Russians were still upto their old_0 tricks_0.194 ."
"g0l-fragment01","41","He ignored the pointed_-0.125 look the DDI was giving_-0.161 him ."
"g0l-fragment01","42","‘ I thought it best if the Director of our operations in New Orleans gave_-0.424 you a run down of what has taken_-0.176 place_-0.353 up to now . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","43","He sat back and let the DDA give_-0.471 a full_-0.152 report , including the trip_-0.258 to the voodoo ceremony and all that followed_-0.118 ."
"g0l-fragment01","44","Sorge did n't stir , even when they mentioned the gruesome spectacle of Trimmler 's arms folded_0.062 in the sign of a swastika ."
"g0l-fragment01","45","‘ We still are n't convinced that Trimmler 's death has anything to do with the death of our agents ."
"g0l-fragment01","46","There 's no definite link_-0.088 . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","47","‘ The situation_-0.031 might be clearer_-0.235 when I 've finished . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","48","Sorge looked round the table , saw their undisguised curiosity ."
"g0l-fragment01","49","‘ In 1942 , in Germany , we had a GRU network_-0.176 named the Rote Kapelle … ’"
"g0l-fragment01","50","‘ What 's that ? ’ asked the Exec Director ."
"g0l-fragment01","51","‘ Red Orchestra_0.471 ."
"g0l-fragment01","52","The Nazis called it that because we had radio operators we code-named musicians ."
"g0l-fragment01","53","Their leader , the Chef , we called him , was Leopold Trepper ."
"g0l-fragment01","54","It was this group that radioed the warning of Operation Blue , the attack on Stalingrad that led_-0.118 to Hitler 's biggest_0 wartime disaster on the Russian Front_0.062 . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","55","‘ Who was feeding_0.147 you all this information in Germany ? ’ asked the Exec Director ."
"g0l-fragment01","56","‘ High-ranking officials ."
"g0l-fragment01","57","Both in the military and in the Government ."
"g0l-fragment01","58","They saw_-0.344 the damage_-0.029 Hitler was doing ."
"g0l-fragment01","59","They did n't disagree with his aims_0.031 , only his methods ."
"g0l-fragment01","60","When they saw_-0.412 that the war could not be won , even as early as 1941 , some of them opened_0.2 up lines_0.029 of communication with us and the British . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","61","‘ We did n't get_-0.062 that sort of stuff_-0.059 till late into 1944 , ’ said the DDA ."
"g0l-fragment01","62","‘ You were n't Europeans ."
"g0l-fragment01","63","We had centuries of contacts_0 to fall back on ."
"g0l-fragment01","64","For all their bravery and resourcefulness , their information was often wasted , because Stalin did n't believe them ."
"g0l-fragment01","65","But then , he found_-0.265 it difficult to believe anyone ."
"g0l-fragment01","66","The Germans , with more sophisticated_0.273 radio-tracking equipment , started to track down the musicians_0.188 ."
"g0l-fragment01","67","Even Trepper was captured and the Rote Kapelle was wound up at the end_-0.314 of 1942 ."
"g0l-fragment01","68","Our information continued for a while , but it was of doubtful_0.229 origin ."
"g0l-fragment01","69","Trepper was interrogated by the Gestapo and we believed he became a double_0.543 agent , a lot_-0.353 of misinformation was received in Moscow . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","70","Sorge leant across and finished his coffee before continuing ."
"g0l-fragment01","71","‘ But we still needed information ."
"g0l-fragment01","72","The overall network_-0.161 with sources_-0.061 inside Germany was the Rote Drei . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","73","‘ The Red what ? ’ said the Exec Director , pleased that he had deciphered the first word of the new_-0.152 code-name ."
"g0l-fragment01","74","‘ Three ."
"g0l-fragment01","75","The Red Three ."
"g0l-fragment01","76","Based in Switzerland and named after the three transmitters that they used ."
"g0l-fragment01","77","The most important source_0.088 of information , from agents inside Germany , was from a group under Rudolf Roessler ."
"g0l-fragment01","78","His code-name was Lucy and his network_0.061 , the Lucy Ring_0.156 ."
"g0l-fragment01","79","Roessler , or Lucy , was a Swiss Intelligence Officer of German extraction ."
"g0l-fragment01","80","He had many contacts_0 in Germany ."
"g0l-fragment01","81","Lucy 's four main_-0.4 contacts_-0.088 were Major General Oster who was the head_-0.229 of the Abwehr ; Admiral Canaris who was later hanged for his part_-0.242 in the 1944 bomb plot_0.206 ; Carl Goehdeler who was leader of the official opposition to Hitler ; and Colonel Boetzel , the commanding officer of Intelligence Evaluation ."
"g0l-fragment01","82","There were others , but Lucy never disclosed_0.086 any of them to us . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","83","‘ Even after the war ? ’ asked the DDI ."
"g0l-fragment01","84","‘ The Lucy Ring was disbanded in 1943 , after being responsible_0.031 for some invaluable work ."
"g0l-fragment01","85","I wo n't go_-0.412 through all their successes , but it was substantial_0.25 ."
"g0l-fragment01","86","The British were involved with them through us and it was their advanced work on breaking_0.4 cyphers that enabled the ring_0.057 to establish such a great_-0.212 record ."
"g0l-fragment01","87","But the ring disbanded , once more because of Stalin 's penchant for secrecy , after Moscow tried_-0.265 to bypass_0.412 Roessler and go_-0.219 direct_-0.29 to his Number Two . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","88","‘ So , where 's the link_0.257 ? ’ interrupted the DDA , impatient as ever ."
"g0l-fragment01","89","‘ It 's important you understand the background_0.161 , ’ said Sorge , not allowing the American to get_-0.485 under his skin_-0.182 ."
"g0l-fragment01","90","‘ Nothing further_0.057 came_-0.375 from the ring until the last few weeks of the war ."
"g0l-fragment01","91","With the Allies advancing on the Eastern and Western fronts_0.088 , many high-ranking Germans were out to save their own necks ."
"g0l-fragment01","92","The Lucy Ring was reactivated , this time without the knowledge of the British . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","93","‘ Or the Americans , ’ commented the Exec Director ."
"g0l-fragment01","94","‘ I suggest you take_-0.457 that up with Comrade Stalin , ’ replied Sorge drily ."
"g0l-fragment01","95","‘ It was an impressive list_-0.273 ."
"g0l-fragment01","96","They did n't just have knowledge ."
"g0l-fragment01","97","They also had wealth ."
"g0l-fragment01","98","In all forms_0.257 ."
"g0l-fragment01","99","Art , cash , in every form_-0.03 possible ."
"g0l-fragment01","100","They used the ring because of their line_0 into Switzerland ."
"g0l-fragment01","101","They wanted the security of the Swiss banks and the Russian Bear_0.406 ."
"g0l-fragment01","102","One was dependent on the other . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","103","‘ So they bought_0.031 immunity_0.152 ."
"g0l-fragment01","104","While our boys were still getting killed , ’ snapped_0.091 the DDI ."
"g0l-fragment01","105","‘ As were ours , ’ snapped_-0.031 back Sorge ."
"g0l-fragment01","106","‘ But your hands_0.088 were n't that_-0.265 clean_0.182 ."
"g0l-fragment01","107","You were bringing scientists and others into America just as we were ."
"g0l-fragment01","108","Scientists with Nazi records , scientists with a history of brutality , war criminals . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","109","‘ Gentlemen , please , ’ said Nowak , ever the diplomat ."
"g0l-fragment01","110","‘ Can we just stick_0.083 to what we 're here to discuss ?"
"g0l-fragment01","111","Go_-0.324 on , Dimitri . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","112","Sorge was annoyed with himself , irritated_0.091 that he had allowed the Intelligence man to get_-0.371 under his skin_0 ."
"g0l-fragment01","113","‘ Of course , ’ he smiled back ."
"g0l-fragment01","114","‘ Now … ah , yes … we used the Lucy Ring ."
"g0l-fragment01","115","Many Germans , with their prizes , crossed safely into Switzerland ."
"g0l-fragment01","116","They came in cars , army lorries , even an aeroplane ."
"g0l-fragment01","117","Their riches were stored in the banks under private accounts and then they were brought through Czechoslovakia and East Germany into the Soviet Union . ’"

"g0l-fragment01","119","‘ Those who broke_0.062 their word were hunted down . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","120","‘ And disposed of ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","121","‘ Some needed reminding that we expected them to honour_0.156 their word . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","122","It was a cold_0.303 reminder of their world , of the business they traded_0.094 in daily ."
"g0l-fragment01","123","‘ We had a large colony of Nazis living in the Soviet Union ."
"g0l-fragment01","124","They were n't all scientists , in fact we had little use for most of them ."
"g0l-fragment01","125","They had their own estates and farms to the west of Moscow ."
"g0l-fragment01","126","They kept_-0.171 their secret identities and paid for it through their Swiss bank accounts ."
"g0l-fragment01","127","But they remained Germans , always dreaming_-0.152 of going back to the Fatherland one day . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","128","‘ How many Nazis did you take to Russia after the war ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","129","‘ The Narodnyi Kommissariat Vnutrennikh Del , our People 's Commissariat for Internal Affairs , was responsible_0.147 for — ’"
"g0l-fragment01","130","‘ I never heard_-0.324 of them , ’ the DDA stopped_-0.206 him ."
"g0l-fragment01","131","‘ NKVD , ’ explained the DDI patronizingly ."
"g0l-fragment01","132","‘ Wiped_-0.061 out twenty million Russians for Stalin ."
"g0l-fragment01","133","That right ? ’ he challenged_0.171 Sorge ."
"g0l-fragment01","134","‘ More ."
"g0l-fragment01","135","Thirty million ."
"g0l-fragment01","136","According to official sources_0.133 , ’ Sorge riposted ."
"g0l-fragment01","137","‘ A most useful organization . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","138","That should shut them up ."
"g0l-fragment01","139","He felt_-0.387 the look of disbelief pass_-0.176 between the Exec Director and the DDA ."
"g0l-fragment01","140","The other just watched him , the mocking smile still on his lips ."
"g0l-fragment01","141","He would be the one Rostov had warned him to be wary of ."
"g0l-fragment01","142","He decided to wipe_0 the smile off his face ."
"g0l-fragment01","143","‘ Thirty thousand ."
"g0l-fragment01","144","That 's how many East Germans we deported into the Soviet Union after the war . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","145","The DDI 's smile disappeared_0.375 ."
"g0l-fragment01","146","‘ Thirty thousand Nazis ?"
"g0l-fragment01","147","Jesus . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","148","‘ Yes ."
"g0l-fragment01","149","And we kept another hundred and twenty thousand between 1945 and 1954 in Hitler 's old concentration camps ."
"g0l-fragment01","150","Many were Nazis , but businessmen and professionals were also our targets_-0.031 ."
"g0l-fragment01","151","A third of those died ."
"g0l-fragment01","152","The others were eventually released and absorbed_0.324 into the Democratic Republic . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","153","‘ Including Nazi sympathizers ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","154","‘ Probably . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","155","‘ Does n't that concern you ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","156","Sorge shrugged ."
"g0l-fragment01","157","‘ Not really ."
"g0l-fragment01","158","I was eight years old at the time . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","159","It was n't the answer that the DDI expected and Sorge regretted his words ."
"g0l-fragment01","160","He was n't here to make_-0.375 jokes ."
"g0l-fragment01","161","‘ The thirty thousand in the Soviet Union , as I said , became a community_0.062 in their own right ."
"g0l-fragment01","162","Without our knowledge , over the years , with the use of their money and supportive people in the Swiss banks , they forged_0.471 contacts_-0.03 with those left behind_-0.114 in East Germany ."
"g0l-fragment01","163","They all had one dream_-0.059 ."
"g0l-fragment01","164","To see_-0.303 a unified Germany ."
"g0l-fragment01","165","To regain what they had lost_-0.091 ."
"g0l-fragment01","166","They had a code-name amongst themselves ."
"g0l-fragment01","167","Something that linked_0.147 them , was a reminder of how they had got_-0.545 there_0 ."
"g0l-fragment01","168","It had to be a safe_-0.061 name , innocuous , nothing that would draw_-0.133 attention to the past ."
"g0l-fragment01","169","They remembered the Lucy network_-0.03 , their gateway_0.273 out of Germany ."
"g0l-fragment01","170","They called themselves Die Lucie Geister . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","171","‘ The Lucy Ghosts_0.182 . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","172","‘ Yes . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","173","‘ Did the organization extend_0.059 to America ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","174","The Exec Director was alarmed ."
"g0l-fragment01","175","How the hell_0.029 did they …"
"g0l-fragment01","176","‘ Goodenache ."
"g0l-fragment01","177","I guess he was one of them ? ’ asked the DDI ."
"g0l-fragment01","178","‘ We were n't sure , but in view of his sudden departure , I would say yes . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","179","‘ Which ties_0.219 Trimmler in ."
"g0l-fragment01","180","And God knows who else ."
"g0l-fragment01","181","The name Grob Mitzer mean_0 anything ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","182","‘ He was one of their leaders ."
"g0l-fragment01","183","It was the Lucy Ghosts who supplied him with the cash that helped_-0.412 him build_-0.188 his empire_0.312 . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","184","‘ Why did n't you stop_-0.515 it ?"
"g0l-fragment01","185","Damn it , you knew about it for long enough , ’ snapped_0.129 the Exec Director ."
"g0l-fragment01","186","‘ We did n't realize how important it was ."
"g0l-fragment01","187","We thought they were like any other wartime group , nothing more than reminiscences and marching songs ."
"g0l-fragment01","188","Old men remembering their youth ."
"g0l-fragment01","189","The importance of it did n't surface_0.152 until Germany was reunified ."
"g0l-fragment01","190","And it was only the Englishman overhearing the conversation between Goodenache and Trimmler that finally bridged_0.333 the gap_-0.062 . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","191","‘ So why should the English guy take off with the girl ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","192","The DDI changed_-0.242 the subject_-0.086 ."
"g0l-fragment01","193","‘ He 's not one of us ."
"g0l-fragment01","194","I suggest you ask_-0.457 your Allies about that ."
"g0l-fragment01","195","Maybe he 's just an adventurer ."
"g0l-fragment01","196","No more ."
"g0l-fragment01","197","You must have cleared_0.057 him . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","198","‘ Of course . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","199","The Exec Director did n't want his dirty_0.364 washing_0.355 wrung_0.265 out in front of this Russian ."
"g0l-fragment01","200","‘ Was there anything else ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","201","‘ Only that the GDR , East Germany , as it was , is different to the West ."
"g0l-fragment01","202","There are still many there who have n't forgotten the war ."
"g0l-fragment01","203","Their attitude_-0.139 is different to us ."
"g0l-fragment01","204","Some are still waiting for the war to end ."
"g0l-fragment01","205","They 're a traditional people ."
"g0l-fragment01","206","Many ex-Nazis , even Gestapo , working and living normal everyday lives . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","207","‘ Working for the Stasi . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","208","The DDI reminded them all of the secret police who had run_-0.312 East Germany with an iron_0.226 fist_-0.121 ."
"g0l-fragment01","209","‘ Some , yes ."
"g0l-fragment01","210","Others returned_-0.094 to the jobs they had before the war ."
"g0l-fragment01","211","Within the new_-0.212 Germany , many of them have become frightened ."
"g0l-fragment01","212","Their secrets are no longer safe_-0.441 ."
"g0l-fragment01","213","Most of all , they fear the Israelis . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","214","‘ Is Frick one of these guys ? ’ asked the DDA , remembering the name picked_0.108 up by Adam in New Orleans ."
"g0l-fragment01","215","‘ No , ’ lied Sorge ."
"g0l-fragment01","216","His orders_-0.515 were quite specific ."
"g0l-fragment01","217","Do n't ratify any names ."
"g0l-fragment01","218","They did n't want the Yanks stumbling_0.097 in and screwing_0.029 up in an attempt to force_-0.029 the issue ."
"g0l-fragment01","219","‘ So what 's all this got_-0.303 to do with the deaths of our agents ? ’ continued the DDA ."
"g0l-fragment01","220","‘ We 're not sure ."
"g0l-fragment01","221","Except that a lot_-0.382 of the information we have both lost_-0.182 was about the Lucy Ghosts ."
"g0l-fragment01","222","Link_-0.182 that with Trimmler 's death , Goodenache 's sudden departure for Germany and the mention of the Lucy Ghosts during their conversation , and I think you will agree that is the strongest_0 lead_-0.031 we have to follow_-0.188 . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","223","Nobody spoke for a while , then the Exec Director reopened_-0.125 the discussion ."
"g0l-fragment01","224","‘ Has Moscow any suggestions as to how we should proceed_-0.156 ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","225","‘ No , ’ replied Sorge , which was what he 'd been told to say ."
"g0l-fragment01","226","‘ We hoped you would come up with something . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","227","‘ I 'm sure we will . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","228","‘ Can you tell us the names of some of these Lucy Ghosts ? ’ cut in the DDI ."
"g0l-fragment01","229","‘ The ones in Russia ."
"g0l-fragment01","230","How high_-0.206 up the ladder_0.206 did they go_-0.438 ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","231","Sorge enjoyed his reply ."
"g0l-fragment01","232","‘ In time , yes ."
"g0l-fragment01","233","But I can tell you you 're wasting your efforts looking for Martin Bormann in South America ."
"g0l-fragment01","234","He died twenty years ago . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","235","He watched their stunned_-0.114 faces across the room ."
"g0l-fragment01","236","Well and truly shafted ."
"g0l-fragment01","237","They said little after that and Sorge was soon being escorted , with Nowak , down to the underground garage ."
"g0l-fragment01","238","Five minutes later they were on their way back to Washington ."
"g0l-fragment01","239","‘ Bormann ."
"g0l-fragment01","240","Fucking Bormann ."
"g0l-fragment01","241","They had him all the time , ’ said an astonished DDI ."
"g0l-fragment01","242","‘ Would'ya believe it ?"
"g0l-fragment01","243","They probably got_-0.182 Hitler stashed_0.364 away_-0.056 too . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","244","‘ Well , it 's been a real eye-opener , ’ said the Exec Director ."
"g0l-fragment01","245","‘ But let's not forget we 've still got_-0.257 a crisis_0.114 on ."
"g0l-fragment01","246","Find the Englishman ."
"g0l-fragment01","247","That 's our first priority ."
"g0l-fragment01","248","Find him and see_-0.5 what the son_-0.118 of a bitch_0.235 is upto . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","249","The AmTrak Crescent Atlanta Georgia"
"g0l-fragment01","250","The train pulled out of Atlanta Station at 7.39 p.m. , four minutes behind schedule ."
"g0l-fragment01","251","They had slept well , eaten well , slept again and eventually got bored with the passing_0.091 countryside ."
"g0l-fragment01","252","Adam had insisted they stay in the room and she had n't found_-0.152 a good enough reason to change_-0.176 his mind ."
"g0l-fragment01","253","He was thumbing through USA Today for the umpteenth time , looking for something he might have missed_-0.129 , when he heard her giggling ."
"g0l-fragment01","254","She was in the swivel chair , reflected in the window with the dark night as a backdrop_0.273 , her head angled towards him ."
"g0l-fragment01","255","‘ What 's so funny ? ’ he asked pleasantly , putting the paper down ."
"g0l-fragment01","256","‘ You sure know how to give_-0.235 a girl a good time . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","257","‘ Do n't I ? ’ he grinned back ."
"g0l-fragment01","258","‘ According to all the books , a secret agent 's life 's meant_-0.212 to be glamorous_0.212 ."
"g0l-fragment01","259","We 've spent_-0.265 twenty-four hours together and in that time I 've been bitten_-0.257 by bugs in a hooker 's bed , tied up a guy with no legs and stolen his wheelchair , stayed cooped up in a train for twelve hours with an attractive man and behaved like a virgin ."
"g0l-fragment01","260","Do n't take_-0.333 that the wrong way_-0.286 ."
"g0l-fragment01","261","But James Bond would 've handled_0 it differently . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","262","‘ He was Scottish ."
"g0l-fragment01","263","I 'm English ."

"g0l-fragment01","266","‘ What happens next ? ’"

"g0l-fragment01","271","‘ Trimmler 's dead . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","272","‘ And Goodenache 's running_-0.032 from the Russians ."
"g0l-fragment01","273","He ca n't go back there ."
"g0l-fragment01","274","From what I heard_-0.121 , Germany was still their home_-0.412 ."
"g0l-fragment01","275","And Nordhausen was where they shared_-0.353 something special ."
"g0l-fragment01","276","They wanted to go there ."
"g0l-fragment01","277","If Goodenache 's frightened , and he wants to hide , that 's as good a place as any . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","278","‘ Nordhausen ."
"g0l-fragment01","279","Where is that ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","280","‘ Central Germany ."
"g0l-fragment01","281","South of Berlin , near what was the old_-0.333 East-West border_-0.735 ."
"g0l-fragment01","282","An industrial town ."
"g0l-fragment01","283","It was also where the Nazis built most of their rockets , the V1s and V2s , during the Second World War ."
"g0l-fragment01","284","From what I remember , they moved most of the rocket manufacture down there so that our bombers could n't get_-0.533 to them ."
"g0l-fragment01","285","Built the factory right in the heart_-0.029 of the mountains ."
"g0l-fragment01","286","Used slave labour ."
"g0l-fragment01","287","I think a lot of people died in the making of those weapons , before they ever got launched and blew_0.029 up half of London . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","288","‘ Why would they want to go back there ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","289","‘ Who knows ."
"g0l-fragment01","290","Maybe it was a job they never finished . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","291","‘ But they did ."
"g0l-fragment01","292","Those guys put_-0.353 people into space , put_-0.485 our people on the moon ."
"g0l-fragment01","293","That 's enough for most people . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","294","‘ That was just their work ."
"g0l-fragment01","295","And they did n't do it for Germany ."
"g0l-fragment01","296","They did it for their conquerors . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","297","‘ You telling me that all those scientists spent_0.147 their time in America and could n't wait to get home_-0.176 ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","298","‘ Not all of them ."
"g0l-fragment01","299","Most of them became good Americans ."
"g0l-fragment01","300","And good Russians , I suppose ."
"g0l-fragment01","301","But these two wanted to go home_-0.364 ."
"g0l-fragment01","302","They never stopped_-0.118 being Germans ."
"g0l-fragment01","303","Maybe it 's the only thing_-0.303 they ever dreamt_0.147 about . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","304","‘ Weird . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","305","‘ Is it ?"
"g0l-fragment01","306","To want to go home_-0.324 ? ’"

"g0l-fragment01","318","Here 's us , heading_0.129 for trouble and God knows what else , and in the middle_-0.065 of you talking about Nordhausen , I start thinking of Peter ."

"g0l-fragment01","320","The emotional_0.182 mind of a woman . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","321","‘ Stop_-0.419 knocking_0.059 yourself . ’"

"g0l-fragment01","326","What 's got you so tickled ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","327","‘ Here we are , crammed_0.303 in a small compartment in a train , hurtling across America being chased_0.059 by the CIA , the FBI and God knows who else , and you 're worried about your ex-husband 's sex life ."
"g0l-fragment01","328","Christ , he must 've been good . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","329","‘ He was a shit_0.353 . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","330","‘ So , why … ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","331","Adam stopped_-0.257 and shook his head ."
"g0l-fragment01","332","‘ Because some of us like shits_0.273 ."
"g0l-fragment01","333","Do n't ask me why . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","334","She laughed with him ."
"g0l-fragment01","335","‘ He 's cheap , too ."
"g0l-fragment01","336","He once bought me a Louis Vuitton handbag ."
"g0l-fragment01","337","Your travel case reminded_-0.094 me of it when we left the hotel ."
"g0l-fragment01","338","It was for our second anniversary ."
"g0l-fragment01","339","I broke the lock and took it back to the shop in La Jolla ."
"g0l-fragment01","340","They told me it was a fake ."
"g0l-fragment01","341","A fucking Hong Kong fake ."
"g0l-fragment01","342","Can you believe that ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","343","‘ What did he say ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","344","‘ That he 'd bought it in New York when he was there on a visit ."
"g0l-fragment01","345","And if he could remember where the shop was , he 'd go back and sue the bastards_0.156 ."
"g0l-fragment01","346","That 's Peter for you ."
"g0l-fragment01","347","A cheapskate liar and womanizer ."
"g0l-fragment01","348","And I ca n't let him go_-0.706 ."
"g0l-fragment01","349","That 's really pathetic news ."

"g0l-fragment01","358","‘ Was ."
"g0l-fragment01","359","They all died when I was nine . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","360","‘ You said they were out of the country ."

"g0l-fragment01","363","‘ Was he an identical twin ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","364","‘ Yes . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","365","‘ That means_-0.562 you came from the same egg ."
"g0l-fragment01","366","That right ? ’"
"g0l-fragment01","367","‘ Something like that . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","368","He , in his usual stoical manner , did n't tell her that he had studiously learnt everything about twins and their relationships ."
"g0l-fragment01","369","‘ I had a boyfriend in High School ."
"g0l-fragment01","370","He was a twin and his brother played on the football team_-0.062 ."
"g0l-fragment01","371","If he got hurt , my guy used to suffer , too ."
"g0l-fragment01","372","We used to watch the game together and I 'd suddenly see him wince in pain ."
"g0l-fragment01","373","Just like that ."
"g0l-fragment01","374","And I 'd look on the field and it was his brother who 'd been tackled . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","375","‘ Yes ."
"g0l-fragment01","376","Something like that . ’"
"g0l-fragment01","377","He laughed ."

"kbc-fragment13","6184","See_-0.345 they say it was a it 's hereditary ."
"kbc-fragment13","6185","Well"
"kbc-fragment13","6186","Cos his father had a bypass did n't he ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6187","Oh did he ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6188","I think some other relative died er"
"kbc-fragment13","6189","Oh ."
"kbc-fragment13","6190","youngish ."
"kbc-fragment13","6191","Yes ."
"kbc-fragment13","6192","Oh well I bet_0.333 , I think perhaps it is really ."
"kbc-fragment13","6193","I know ."
"kbc-fragment13","6194","It 's still going_0.1 ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6195","I know ."
"kbc-fragment13","6196","Yeah , and you ca n't , you ca n't understand it can you really ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6197","Well look_-0.133 at the old lady that walks past here at ninety one !"
"kbc-fragment13","6198","That 's right , yeah ."
"kbc-fragment13","6199","Yeah ."
"kbc-fragment13","6200","And she does all her own shopping ."
"kbc-fragment13","6201","Mm ."
"kbc-fragment13","6202","You know , I mean , she keeps stopping but she 's , she 's remarkable !"
"kbc-fragment13","6203","She really is ."
"kbc-fragment13","6204","Mm ."
"kbc-fragment13","6205","But they 're few and far_-0.241 between_0.379 are n't they ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6206","When you 're like that ."
"kbc-fragment13","6207","Yeah ."
"kbc-fragment13","6208","Mm ."
"kbc-fragment13","6209","But what I could n't understand with this this fella that"
"kbc-fragment13","6210","This Sounness ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6211","Aye ."
"kbc-fragment13","6212","He , he found out cos he went for , to , for a check up and they took_0.2 his blood pressure ."
"kbc-fragment13","6213","Yes ."
"kbc-fragment13","6214","And well lots of people go and have blood pressure taken_-0.033 , they find_-0.267 it 's high_0.233 , and they"
"kbc-fragment13","6215","Yes ."
"kbc-fragment13","6216","give them tablets ."
"kbc-fragment13","6217","Yes ."
"kbc-fragment13","6218","Go home ."
"kbc-fragment13","6219","Why did they take_-0.241 it a stage_0.31 further_0.036 with him ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6220","He 'd got_-0.321 high_-0.233 blood pressure , he was n't in any pain he 's living a normal life ."
"kbc-fragment13","6221","Similar to what I was when I went ."
"kbc-fragment13","6222","Yes ."
"kbc-fragment13","6223","And they just give me tablets ."
"kbc-fragment13","6224","Yes ."
"kbc-fragment13","6225","Now why , what made_-0.367 them take_-0.167 it to the stage_-0.1"
"kbc-fragment13","6226","Well er well , first"
"kbc-fragment13","6227","where , he wanted a heart bypass ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6228","first and foremost he was in a private scheme ."
"kbc-fragment13","6229","Well , probably that 's it then ."
"kbc-fragment13","6230","Yeah ."
"kbc-fragment13","6231","and probably because because of his father and er the the other relative having the bypasses done ."
"kbc-fragment13","6232","So they took_-0.3 it"
"kbc-fragment13","6233","Mm ."
"kbc-fragment13","6234","a step_-0.4 further_-0.207 , but I think probably , it 's because he was in er er a private scheme ."
"kbc-fragment13","6235","Very likely in n it ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6236","Yes ."
"kbc-fragment13","6237","So there 's a lot_0 of people walking about with just taking bloody_-0.071 tablets who probably really should have a bypass ."
"kbc-fragment13","6238","Ah well I , well , I would n't say that really Gordon ."
"kbc-fragment13","6239","I mean I think er , when your blood pressure was found out and you 'd been taking tablets ever , so , I think it 's kept_-0.5 it all under control and you 've , you , we eat a sensible diet ."
"kbc-fragment13","6240","The only , the only er thing_-0.233 I complained about with you is , is the butter ."
"kbc-fragment13","6241","Mm ."
"kbc-fragment13","6242","I do n't have that_-0.267 much now ."
"kbc-fragment13","6243","But I think everything in moderation , but you do n't eat as much butter now as what you used to ."
"kbc-fragment13","6244","I do n't eat that_-0.067 much bread you see_-0.3 ."
"kbc-fragment13","6245","No ."
"kbc-fragment13","6246","So I , I think really , and I think what I think with him , I think definitely I think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family , it runs_0.31 in the family ."
"kbc-fragment13","6247","Mm mm ."
"kbc-fragment13","6248","Must be hell_-0.033 of a shock_0.167 being told"
"kbc-fragment13","6249","Oh God !"
"kbc-fragment13","6250","It must have been ."
"kbc-fragment13","6251","See_-0.4 how much it 's costing ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6252","Two hundred and fifty pounds a night !"
"kbc-fragment13","6253","Yeah ."
"kbc-fragment13","6254","Phworgh !"
"kbc-fragment13","6255","That 's without the operation ."
"kbc-fragment13","6256","Yeah ."
"kbc-fragment13","6257","Well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year then ."
"kbc-fragment13","6258","Oh I know ."
"kbc-fragment13","6259","And plus he 's , he , he , he , he married an heiress you know ."
"kbc-fragment13","6260","Did he ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6261","Er him er , they live in Spain now ."
"kbc-fragment13","6262","Oh er he , he 's worth a pretty_0.333 penny_0.379 is Sounness ."
"kbc-fragment13","6263","He went in Carl 's shop the other , the other week ."
"kbc-fragment13","6264","Did he ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6265","Yes !"
"kbc-fragment13","6266","Mm ."
"kbc-fragment13","6267","Must have been looking for a house ."
"kbc-fragment13","6268","Carl said he , he looked er well er , his face did , it were very he 's got a very poxy skin ."
"kbc-fragment13","6269","Has he ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6270","You mm ."
"kbc-fragment13","6271","Yes ."
"kbc-fragment13","6272","He was having it done this afternoon were n't he ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6273","Yeah ."
"kbc-fragment13","6274","Some time today ."
"kbc-fragment13","6275","Aye ."
"kbc-fragment13","6276","I tell you what , that 's quick_0.233 int it though Gordon ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6277","With only going in last night and"
"kbc-fragment13","6278","Mm ."
"kbc-fragment13","6279","having it done today ."
"kbc-fragment13","6280","It is indeed ."
"kbc-fragment13","6281","I wonder how quick_0 they would have got him in though if he would n't have been in a private scheme ."
"kbc-fragment13","6282","He could wait six months could n't he ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6283","Well he could have been dead by then ."
"kbc-fragment13","6284","Well er , yeah , exactly that 's what they 're moaning about int it ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6285","Terrible !"
"kbc-fragment13","6286","Put_-0.207 them on a list and wait ."
"kbc-fragment13","6287","I 've never heard so much talk about health as we do nowadays ."
"kbc-fragment13","6288","Oh I know ."
"kbc-fragment13","6289","When I was young I I do n't remember talking all the time about bloody_0.107 health and what you should do and what you should n't do ."
"kbc-fragment13","6290","No I know ."
"kbc-fragment13","6291","Did you ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6292","No ."
"kbc-fragment13","6293","But we were n't educated in , in , in health though ."
"kbc-fragment13","6294","We just we just lived and that was the end_-0.4 of it ."
"kbc-fragment13","6295","Yes but then you see_-0.31 , in the in the old_-0.296 days Gordon , I mean , you you were very fortunate if you got three meals a day and and whatever you got you were glad of and used to eat it all ."
"kbc-fragment13","6296","Now we 're much more affluent and people are educated er"
"kbc-fragment13","6297","Mm ."
"kbc-fragment13","6298","as regards their health ."
"kbc-fragment13","6299","Mhm ."
"kbc-fragment13","6300","Well having said that Gordon , your mother lived to a good old_0.367 age , and my mum , and my father did ."
"kbc-fragment13","6301","Yeah ."
"kbc-fragment13","6302","And they ate all the wrong stuff did n't they ?"
"kbc-fragment13","6303","According to according to what they say now they did ."
"kbc-fragment13","6304","Mm ."
"kbc-fragment13","6305","I know ."
"kbc-fragment13","6306","Do n't know who to believe really ."
"kbc-fragment13","6307","When you look_0.167 at , when you look_0.069 at the some , all these , a lot_0.133 of these composers and artists who died long ago and you look_0.333 the birth range_-0.31 there 's a hell_0.167 of a lot_-0.267 at seventy five , seventy six"

"kbc-fragment13","6320","you know"
"kbc-fragment13","6321","how much , how much , I do n't really know ."
"kbc-fragment13","6322","Cos there 's more people now than there was in those days ."

"kbh-fragment04","320","Well so many of these songs have been done by so many people that you would be forgiven for thinking that , that ."
"kbh-fragment04","321","Because there 's one there , one on one of these that er either Paul Simon or Art Garfunkel or someone , ca n't remember which one , probably Art Garfunkel as Paul Simon does all his own does n't he ?"
"kbh-fragment04","322","Well he has done other people 's ."
"kbh-fragment04","323","Well there 's one on there , I ca n't remember"

"kbh-fragment04","334","Shut up ."
"kbh-fragment04","335","Ca n't remember which one it is but I 'll recognise it when I hear it ."
"kbh-fragment04","336","He 's doing very well , is n't he ."
"kbh-fragment04","337","He is ."
"kbh-fragment04","338","Have to employ him full time ."
"kbh-fragment04","339","He 's always quite good ."
"kbh-fragment04","340","I just ca n't believe how daft he is ."
"kbh-fragment04","341","I suppose you like that film ."
"kbh-fragment04","342","Yes ."
"kbh-fragment04","343","Forget it ."
"kbh-fragment04","344","You 're not having cake ."
"kbh-fragment04","345","Does she like cake ?"
"kbh-fragment04","346","Well she 's looking at it ."
"kbh-fragment04","347","So how 's things_-0.1 down at the ?"
"kbh-fragment04","348","Not too bad ."
"kbh-fragment04","349","Quite good actually ."
"kbh-fragment04","350","Yeah ?"
"kbh-fragment04","351","Keeping him busy out on estimates and"
"kbh-fragment04","352","Yeah he 's out all this week ."
"kbh-fragment04","353","Well , my dad wo n't pass_-0.333 them onto Terry ."
"kbh-fragment04","354","Me dad said he 's had enough Well , we were debating whether to give_-0.633 it to you or not ."
"kbh-fragment04","355","But I thought , well if Terry notices he might ."
"kbh-fragment04","356","Well in fact two really big_-0.31 estimates"
"kbh-fragment04","357","Who , Terry ?"
"kbh-fragment04","358","Yeah ."
"kbh-fragment04","359","And one wanted_0.133 re-estimating , the other one wanted_0.3 a few more prices cos everything like marble tops which are going to cost a fortune to get done ."
"kbh-fragment04","360","We give_0.138 them a provisional kind of price and not really gone_-0.333 into it in detail_0.138 ."
"kbh-fragment04","361","So she had a list of about_0.033 five things_-0.172 she wanted sorted_0.067 out and she said so far_0.1 we were the cheapest ."
"kbh-fragment04","362","But she 's got_-0.233 about_0.241 six different firms on the computer and was comparing notes ."
"kbh-fragment04","363","So I worked out and the other two were really fitting and electrics and it was all down to Terry to sort_-0.067 those out ."
"kbh-fragment04","364","And they 're both , about_-0.1 two to three thousand pounds worth of sanitary ware or more but two to three thousand pounds worth of work ."
"kbh-fragment04","365","Well you ca n't afford to lose_0.138 them , can you ?"
"kbh-fragment04","366","No ."
"kbh-fragment04","367","So what 's going to happen then ?"
"kbh-fragment04","368","God knows ."
"kbh-fragment04","369","He said , I asked , asked , well I left a message on Saturday for him to sort_0.345 them out did n't I ?"
"kbh-fragment04","370","He already knew about that ."
"kbh-fragment04","371","And then I asked my father on Tuesday to remind him and he said , he 'd already said he 'd fetch_0.067 them in on Tuesday ."
"kbh-fragment04","372","And he , my father reminded him last night and he said yeah he would have them by tomorrow morning ."
"kbh-fragment04","373","But he 's , he just really has to get in touch with one of them and tell them the prices ."
"kbh-fragment04","374","So I do n't know ."
"kbh-fragment04","375","Well , I mean he 'd done , he 's done this first estimate , these are all just polishing_0.241 touches_0.267 cos people are obviously interested in , you know they 're well keen_-0.267 on our prices ."
"kbh-fragment04","376","they ca n't pursue_0.333 it till we come back to them ."
"kbh-fragment04","377","They 're not pursuing_0.138 it until we put_-0.1 these things_0.1 out ."
"kbh-fragment04","378","My father just turned round I 've had enough of it if Terry 's not going to do the estimate he passes_0.207 them on to Brian ."
"kbh-fragment04","379","I said yeah then I get_-0.267 into trouble with them for not passing_-0.2 estimates to Terry and then there 's an argument ."
"kbh-fragment04","380","If he , if he says anything to me I 'll just have to tell him ."
"kbh-fragment04","381","But he 's not doing the estimates he 's been given_-0.333 and he ca n't afford to throw_0.31 money away_0.267 ."
"kbh-fragment04","382","It 's cos he 's working for him at the moment money ."
"kbh-fragment04","383","He always gets like that and then he forgets after like a month or two when he has n't worked for him ."
"kbh-fragment04","384","He forgets how annoying he can be and you know he swings_-0.1 the other way_0.069 ."
"kbh-fragment04","385","I mean Brian 's pulled in a lot_0.033 of work ."
"kbh-fragment04","386","lot_-0.034 of people kind of saying come back again on Thursday So he 's , he 's ."
"kbh-fragment04","387","If we got_-0.267 Terry to do that we 'd be well away_0.069 ."
"kbh-fragment04","388","They , they would love him I mean one of them it was annoying really cos Terry 's just not pulling_0.069 his weight_0.31 ."
"kbh-fragment04","389","I do n't understand it , if I live to be a hundred I wo n't understand it ."
"kbh-fragment04","390","And also , it 's cos that , you know after we had that row about Terry , after Bank Holiday expecting not to have to do a day in the shop , and er he 's already owing Brian a day ?"
"kbh-fragment04","391","Guess who 's doing the extra day ? got_-0.154 my dad to cover_-0.167 a day ."
"kbh-fragment04","392","And then he takes_0.133 a day off Bank Holidays ."
"kbh-fragment04","393","and he ca n't do it because my dad ."
"kbh-fragment04","394","But then tomorrow he 's actually doing his own work ."
"kbh-fragment04","395","So he could easily have ."
"kbh-fragment04","396","And on Monday"
"kbh-fragment04","397","So who 's covering_0.167 tomorrow ?"
"kbh-fragment04","398","Well my brother 's covered_0.333 practically all week and Brian 's doing tomorrow ."
"kbh-fragment04","399","Terry phoned up asking what , Tuesday morning about_0.148 quarter past eight said who was covering_0.167 ."
"kbh-fragment04","400","And he said well my father is doing today I ca n't do today I 'll do it Friday and I shouted down the stairs but he owes you a day you should n't be going in ."
"kbh-fragment04","401","I mean he has n't been in the shop once this week ."
"kbh-fragment04","402","Somebody 's got to tell him to"
"kbh-fragment04","403","So do Dave and Terry in the shop ."
"kbh-fragment04","404","They have the records ."
"kbh-fragment04","405","And it has n't been sorted_0.3 yet ?"
"kbh-fragment04","406","Oh no ."
"kbh-fragment04","407","He 's got_-0.267 the gall_0 to phone up on Tuesday and say Eileen ca n't do a day , we 're going to be short_-0.067 of Eileen ."
"kbh-fragment04","408","So the answer_0 is to just phone them ."
"kbh-fragment04","409","I ca n't do it ."
"kbh-fragment04","410","I 'm not doing it ."
"kbh-fragment04","411","What 's the point_0 of carrying on like that ?"
"kbh-fragment04","412","Well he 's going to carry on like that is n't he ?"
"kbh-fragment04","413","Not unless someone puts_-0.1 their foot_0.133 down ."
"kbh-fragment04","414","And if your father is currently taking_-0.207 your side_0.25 of things_-0.133 worth sounding him out as to how far_-0.143 he 'll take_0.067"
"kbh-fragment04","415","Ah"
"kbh-fragment04","416","whilst he 's in the mood ?"
"kbh-fragment04","417","Yeah ."
"kbh-fragment04","418","He 's not being that_-0.067 much"
"kbh-fragment04","419","You sure ?"
"kbh-fragment04","420","Mmm ."
"kbh-fragment04","421","He 's probably only in the mood cos he 's probably upsetting_-0.033 them on his night out cos they go out in the evenings ."
"kbh-fragment04","422","On a Wednesday evening , do n't they ."
"kbh-fragment04","423","Cos Terry"
"kbh-fragment04","424","I mean , would n't he rather have Terry as a sort of permanent worker anyway ?"
"kbh-fragment04","425","It 's not being fair_-0.276"
"kbh-fragment04","426","do any work ."
"kbh-fragment04","427","Oh what , your dad ?"
"kbh-fragment04","428","Pauline 's dad er"
"kbh-fragment04","429","too expensive I think ."
"kbh-fragment04","430","Terry uses the shop to get extra money every so often , uses my dad ticking over running when he"
"kbh-fragment04","431","Why ."
"kbh-fragment04","432","He does get_-0.067 the offer , I mean"
"kbh-fragment04","433","two months and she phoned up and I kind of made_0 out it got lost in the post ."
"kbh-fragment04","434","I erm got , check you 've got_-0.067 two days , you 've got give_-0.067 me the estimate , it 's got to be on because she 's expecting it to be done straight away on the computer and sent ."
"kbh-fragment04","435","And he actually got that one done ."
"kbh-fragment04","436","Do you know it was only five lines_0.267 ."
"kbh-fragment04","437","I mean I could have made_-0.241 it up it was that_-0.241 easy ."
"kbh-fragment04","438","So I sent that off ."
"kbh-fragment04","439","She was in first thing_0 , I mean I sent it off that evening she was in first thing_-0.138 the next morning yes that 's fine_0.3 ."
"kbh-fragment04","440","So he 's got_0.034 that job and another one ."
"kbh-fragment04","441","She 's trying is n't she ?"
"kbh-fragment04","442","I do n't understand why it surprises you , that 's what gets_0.033 me ."
"kbh-fragment04","443","I mean"
"kbh-fragment04","444","It 's normal behaviour ."
"kbh-fragment04","445","Charlotte 's done it too ."
"kbh-fragment04","446","Can you pass me that er , sheet_0.2 ?"
"kbh-fragment04","447","This ?"
"kbh-fragment04","448","Is that your reading ?"
"kbh-fragment04","449","That 's not your regulations you have to read is it ?"
"kbh-fragment04","450","Oh no , that 's a"
"kbh-fragment04","451","I was going to say that does n't seem very thick"
"kbh-fragment04","452","No , that 's to do with this tape ."
"kbh-fragment04","453","Oh I tell you what is quite funny these , the act ."
"kbh-fragment04","454","Mmm ."
"kbh-fragment04","455","Oh ."

"kbh-fragment04","457","What was it , the Lords temporal and spiritual , that 's what they call themselves ."
"kbh-fragment04","458","Now that is , that 's"
"kbh-fragment04","459","Yes ."
"kbh-fragment04","460","Yeah I realise and I hope I do n't come_-0.067 into contact_-0.2 with too many acts of parliament ."
"kbh-fragment04","461","Oh , we had someone round to see the house yesterday ."

"kbj-fragment17","1514","Right , she wants currency in two divisions_0 in each , right ?"
"kbj-fragment17","1515","So it 's one , two , three , four ,"
"kbj-fragment17","1516","That multiplication is a"
"kbj-fragment17","1517","yeah well divisions_0.2 , okay , so it 's twenty one shared_-0.033 by say , if that 's one , two , three , four , five , six int it ?"
"kbj-fragment17","1518","Oh I know what I 've got_-0.233 !"

"kbj-fragment17","1521","I 've put the , I thought it was er okay ."
"kbj-fragment17","1522","Six ."
"kbj-fragment17","1523","And division_0.379 is shared_0.233 by ."
"kbj-fragment17","1524","So you got to do eighteen shared_0.433 by six is three and eighteen"
"kbj-fragment17","1525","Have you got"
"kbj-fragment17","1526","shared_-0.167 by three is six ."
"kbj-fragment17","1527","So like , you go_-0.267 one , two , three , four , five , six six times you swap_0.233"

"kbj-fragment17","1546","Why do multiplication equation for this similar line_0.133 I do n't get_-0.567 how you do that ?"
"kbj-fragment17","1547","Is it , would you like us to put"
"kbj-fragment17","1548","It 's fours int it ?"

"kbw-fragment09","3859","But she could walk it from her house could n't she ?"
"kbw-fragment09","3860","She could ."
"kbw-fragment09","3861","Because it 's not far ."
"kbw-fragment09","3862","Yeah all she has to do is go go round her bit round just a normal road , across the road down a little_0.1 bit_0.138 and she 's there ."

"kbw-fragment09","3885","That 's true_-0.233 ."

"kbw-fragment11","4166","they get_-0.367 permission then ?"
"kbw-fragment11","4167","They somehow managed_0.433 to persuade the owners , apparently it was and it was and nobody else had ever been allowed in this place not even erm historians who write about famous buildings , even they had been refused access !"
"kbw-fragment11","4168","Where is it ?"
"kbw-fragment11","4169","Somewhere in Oxfordshire ."
"kbw-fragment11","4170","Oh !"
"kbw-fragment11","4171","They do n't know where ?"
"kbw-fragment11","4172","Oh ."

"kbw-fragment11","4175","I think it was about last week 's , but they seem to imply that it was last week 's episode that would"
"kbw-fragment11","4176","Oh ."
"kbw-fragment11","4177","do it ."
"kbw-fragment11","4178","We seem to have got one spare video if we do n't get it watched before Wednesday ."
"kbw-fragment11","4179","Alright ."
"kbw-fragment11","4180","Well that 's the only chance ."
"kbw-fragment11","4181","Oh yeah cos we 're going to Maryland tomorrow ."
"kbw-fragment11","4182","your dad ."
"kbw-fragment11","4183","Mm ."
"kbw-fragment11","4184","Erm not it was n't about your dad , it was about my birthday cos"
"kbw-fragment11","4185","Cos"
"kbw-fragment11","4186","he 'd realized that it was my birthday , and , what did I want ?"
"kbw-fragment11","4187","So I said send me a cheque and I 'll go and shop ."
"kbw-fragment11","4188","And ?"
"kbw-fragment11","4189","And last week cos she 's quite generous is n't she ?"
"kbw-fragment11","4190","She is a bit but it 's ."
"kbw-fragment11","4191","No , I did n't say anything ."
"kbw-fragment11","4192","I think that 's the thing_-0.267 ."
"kbw-fragment11","4193","So your dad sent a cheque ."
"kbw-fragment11","4194","Anyway I asked her if she 'd heard from your dad , and she has heard from your dad apparently on Friday he went to the consultant"
"kbw-fragment11","4195","Mm ."
"kbw-fragment11","4196","and next week he 's got_-0.276 his first well she did n't know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy ."
"kbw-fragment11","4197","And she said he has to go trotting_0.31 to Exeter two or three times a week now ."
"kbw-fragment11","4198","Mm ."
"kbw-fragment11","4199","I do n't know how long it 's going to go_-0.133 on for , or what it is exactly but I thought it would be a good idea to ring your dad up and see_0.172 ."
"kbw-fragment11","4200","Mm ."
"kbw-fragment11","4201","But at least things_-0.2 have moved_0 , and at least they 've gone round ."
"kbw-fragment11","4202","So I 'm pleased really , are you ?"
"kbw-fragment11","4203","Interesting that they 've done it so quickly_0.4 is n't it ?"
"kbw-fragment11","4204","After seeing him , because he thought that once he 'd seen the consultant it would then take_-0.138 some time to get the treatment started , but they must have got_0 themselves over that ."
