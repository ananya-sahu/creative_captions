# Metaphor Schema Annotation Guide
Version 1.0, 16 March 2015

Metaphors are not invoked randomly -- when a target domain is mapped to a
source domain, that mapping (or *conceptual metaphor*) is motivated by a
connection or similarity between the two domains. In a conceptual
metaphor, the target of interest (e.g., democracy, poverty, or gun
control), plays a role in the source domain. While the details of the
conceptual metaphor's meaning depends on the specific source domain, the
role the target plays falls into a small number of *conceptual schemas*.
These are basic scenarios such as:

- There is a threat to a person's health and safety. That threat may be
  mitigated by something.
- A person has a goal and wants to reach that goal. Some things facilitate
  reaching that goal and other things hinder reaching it.

We use a set of conceptual schemas to describe these general categories:
1. Health and Safety
2. Journey
3. Conflict
4. Power and Control
5. Engineering and Business
6. Morality and Justice
7. Systematic Explanations
8. Plants
9. Animals
10. Human Life Cycle and Relations
11. Darkness and Light
12. High and Low
13. Nature
14. Embodied Experience

The following documents give the conceptual schema or schemas for each of
these categories, enumerating their slots and permissable values. These
schemas are used to annotate linguistic metaphors, e.g., for the sentence,

> she starts with the premise that those rights are something that need
> to be pruned because of the politics of those of us who advocate them
> have you ever noticed that EVERY SINGLE gun rights basher on
> this forum is a far lefty?

The linguistic metaphor source 'basher' evokes the concept *Monster*, while
the target 'gun rights' evokes the concept *Gun Rights*. But what is the
conceptual metaphor, i.e., what is the metaphor saying? The metaphor tells
a story like this: A 'basher' is a threat to the health and safety of 'gun
rights'.

To generate an explanation like this, we need to know the important
aspects of the metaphor. *Monster* is in the category *Health and Safety*,
whose schema consists of these slots:
- *Threat*, e.g., monsters, tsunamis, diseases, parasites
- *Threatened*, e.g., sick people, infested people, contaminated things
- *Protection* or mitigation of threats, e.g., medicine, protection,
shelter.
- *Beneficial* or necessary things, e.g., beating hearts, food, doctors.

Each of these that applies to the sentence should be instantiated with the
shortest excerpt of text necessary to convey the metaphor's meaning, e.g.,
- *Threat*: basher
- *Threatened*: gun rights
