"When she L_reached the L_plateau she L_remained L_standing , L_watching for L_Joss L_Barnet , L_waiting for the L_moment when she would L_see him L_riding towards her ."
There was no L_longer any L_need for her to be
‘ M_discovered ’ .
Her L_sole L_purpose in being there was to L_meet him and she was L_content that he should L_know it .
He was L_late this L_morning .
Or was she L_earlier than she L_thought ?
Had she M_misjudged the L_time ?
No L_matter .
"She was L_happy to L_wait for him , L_certain that L_soon she would L_see him L_riding towards her ."
"Then as the L_minutes M_passed and there was no M_sign of him , she M_considered that L_perhaps he had L_overslept ."
It could L_happen .
"Or had his L_horse L_gone L_lame , L_cast a L_shoe ?"
She L_sat down and L_prepared to L_wait as L_long as was L_necessary .
She L_knew that in the M_end he would L_come .
"After a few more L_minutes she L_became L_restless , and L_stood up again , her L_eyes M_searching the L_slope of the L_hillside and the L_valley below , M_trying to L_determine whether some M_small L_movement down there was a L_man on L_horseback or L_merely a M_trick of her L_imagination ."
Should she L_set off down the L_hill to L_meet him ?
But L_perhaps he would L_come by another L_route and then she would M_miss him .
"At the M_end of what she M_reckoned must be an L_hour , she M_faced the L_fact that he was not L_coming ."
"She L_dropped to the L_ground again and L_lay down , M_burying her L_face in the M_sweet-smelling L_grass ."
She had been L_mistaken L_ever to L_think that he would L_come .
"She had M_let her L_overwhelming L_desire M_feed her L_imagination ; had M_read L_something into his L_words , his L_looks , his L_actions , which had not been there at all ."
